To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Dual-modal Prior Semantic Guided Infrared and Visible Image Fusion for Intelligent Transportation System" by Jing Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted extensive experiments on two public datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section IV (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention using the **MSRS dataset** and the **FMB dataset** for their experiments. I will take note of any specific details provided about these datasets, such as their characteristics, size, and purpose.

1. **MSRS Dataset**: The authors state that this dataset contains aligned image pairs and annotated segmentation labels, which is crucial for their semantic segmentation and fusion tasks.

2. **FMB Dataset**: Similar to the MSRS dataset, the FMB dataset is also used for evaluating the proposed method, and it contains aligned image pairs and annotated segmentation labels.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are essential for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

- For the **MSRS dataset**, the citation is:
  > Liu, J., Liu, Z., Wu, G., Ma, L., Liu, R., Zhong, W., Luo, Z., & Fan, X. (2023). Multi-interactive feature learning and a full-time multi-modality benchmark for image fusion and segmentation. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 8115–8124.

- For the **FMB dataset**, the citation is:
  > Ju, M., He, C., Liu, J., Kang, B., Su, J., & Zhang, D. (2022). IVF-Net: An infrared and visible data fusion deep network for traffic object enhancement in intelligent transportation systems. IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems, 24(1), 1220–1234.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will help in accurately documenting the datasets used in the research paper.
