To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Boosting Single Positive Multi-label Classification with Generalized Robust Loss" by Yanxi Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets, which indicates that there are specific datasets to look for.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention four datasets:

1. **Pascal VOC-2012**: This dataset is noted for containing 5,717 training images across 20 categories. The authors refer to the official validation set for testing, which includes 5,823 images.

2. **MS-COCO-2014**: This dataset consists of 82,081 training images and 80 categories. The authors also mention using the official validation set, which has 40,137 images.

3. **NUS-WIDE**: This dataset includes 150,000 training images and 81 classes, with a testing set of 60,260 images. The authors clarify that they used the official version of the dataset to ensure fairness.

4. **CUB-200-2011**: This dataset is divided into 5,994 training images and 5,794 test images, consisting of 312 categories.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:

- For **Pascal VOC-2012**, the citation is:

- For **MS-COCO-2014**, the citation is:

- For **NUS-WIDE**, the citation is:

- For **CUB-200-2011**, the citation is:
  > Wah, C., Branson, S., Welinder, P., Perona, P., & Belongie, S. (2011). The Caltech-UCSD birds-200-2011 dataset.

Now that I have gathered the dataset names and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
