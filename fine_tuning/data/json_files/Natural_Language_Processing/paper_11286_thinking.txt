To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Heterogeneous Autoregressions in Short T Panel Data Models" by M. Hashem Pesaran and Liying Yang, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and empirical application sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and the introduction often discusses the context and relevance of the datasets used.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **empirical application section**. This section typically contains detailed descriptions of the datasets used for analysis. In this paper, the authors mention using the **Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID)** dataset to estimate the persistence of real earnings.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citation for the PSID dataset. The citation for the PSID is typically formatted as follows:

- For the PSID dataset, the citation is:
  > Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID). *University of Michigan, 1968-1995*. Available at: [https://psidonline.isr.umich.edu/](https://psidonline.isr.umich.edu/).

After identifying the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the key details about the dataset, including its purpose, the time period covered, and any relevant characteristics mentioned in the paper.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format for easy reference, ensuring that the full citation is included for each dataset extracted from the paper.
