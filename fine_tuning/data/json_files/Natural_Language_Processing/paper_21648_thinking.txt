To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multimodal Attack Detection for Action Recognition Models" by Furkan Mumcu and Yasin Yilmaz, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a general overview, but the experiments section is likely to contain specific details about the datasets used.

In the **experiments section**, the authors mention using the **Kinetics-400 dataset** for their evaluations. They describe it as a popular and large-scale dataset for action recognition, indicating that it is a significant dataset for their research.

Next, I will look for any additional datasets mentioned throughout the paper. I will pay special attention to sections that discuss methodology and results, as these often include references to datasets used for training and testing.

After identifying the **Kinetics-400 dataset**, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for this dataset. The citation is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the dataset.

The full citation for the **Kinetics-400 dataset** is:
> Will Kay, Joao Carreira, Karen Simonyan, Brian Zhang, Chloe Hillier, Sudheendra Vijayanarasimhan, Fabio Viola, Tim Green, Trevor Back, Paul Natsev, et al. *The kinetics human action video dataset*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1705.06950, 2017.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines the dataset's name, description, and citation.

Finally, I will ensure that all extracted information is accurate and ready for presentation or further processing.
