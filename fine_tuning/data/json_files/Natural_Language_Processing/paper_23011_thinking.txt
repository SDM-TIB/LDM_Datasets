To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Continuous Temporal Domain Generalization" by Zekun Cai et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for evaluation. The introduction typically outlines the context and significance of the research, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors usually detail the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, characteristics, and any relevant statistics.

In the **experiments section**, the authors describe several datasets used in their analysis:

1. **Rotated 2-Moons**: This dataset consists of two moon-shaped clusters, each containing 500 instances. The dataset is generated by rotating the clusters over time, simulating continuous concept drift.

2. **Rotated MNIST**: A variant of the classic MNIST dataset, this dataset includes images of handwritten digits that are rotated over time. It contains 1,000 images selected from the MNIST dataset at each timestamp.

3. **Influenza Dataset**: This dataset utilizes tweets to predict flu intensity, collected over 50 arbitrary timestamps during the flu seasons from 2010 to 2014. The data is validated against reported flu activity levels.

4. **Yearbook Dataset**: This dataset consists of yearbook portraits collected from 1930 to 2013, used for gender classification. It includes data from 40 different years, simulating missing domain data collection.

5. **Cyclone Dataset**: Collected through satellite remote sensing, this dataset tracks tropical cyclones and their wind intensity over time, with data captured every three hours.

6. **House Dataset**: This dataset contains housing price data from 2013 to 2019, used for regression tasks to predict house prices based on various features.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and further exploration of the datasets.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

- **Rotated 2-Moons**: This dataset is a variant of the classic 2-Moons dataset, which is widely referenced in literature but does not have a specific citation as it is commonly generated for experiments.

- **Rotated MNIST**: The original MNIST dataset citation is:
  > Li Deng. "The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digit Images for Machine Learning Research [Best of the Web]." IEEE Signal Processing Magazine, 29(6):141–142, 2012.

- **Influenza Dataset**: The citation for the Influenza dataset is:
  > Liang Zhao, Qian Sun, Jieping Ye, Feng Chen, Chang-Tien Lu, and Naren Ramakrishnan. "Feature Constrained Multi-task Learning Models for Spatiotemporal Event Forecasting." IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering, 29(5):1059–1072, 2017.

- **Yearbook Dataset**: The citation for the Yearbook dataset is:
  > Huaxiu Yao, Caroline Choi, Bochuan Cao, Yoonho Lee, Pang Wei W Koh, and Chelsea Finn. "Wild-time: A Benchmark of In-the-Wild Distribution Shift Over Time." Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 35:10309–10324, 2022.

- **Cyclone Dataset**: The citation for the Cyclone dataset is:
  > Boyo Chen, Buo-Fu Chen, and Hsuan-Tien Lin. "Rotation-blended CNNs on a New Open Dataset for Tropical Cyclone Image-to-Intensity Regression." In Proceedings of the 24th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery & Data Mining, pages 90–99, 2018.

- **House Dataset**: The citation for the House dataset is:
  > Fengchun Qiao, Long Zhao, and Xi Peng. "Learning to Learn Single Domain Generalization." In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 12556–12565, 2020.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use.
