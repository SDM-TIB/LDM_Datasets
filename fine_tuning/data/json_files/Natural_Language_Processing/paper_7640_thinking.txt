To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-Resolution Subspace-Based Optimization Method for the Retrieval of 2D Perfect Electric Conductors" by X. Ye et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the proposed method is validated against both synthetic and experimental data, which suggests that there are datasets involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental assessment section** (Section 4.4), where the authors discuss two specific datasets used for validation:

1. **rectTM_cent Dataset**: This dataset was generated by measuring the electromagnetic interactions between a metallic cylinder and an EM field radiated by a horn antenna. The authors provide details about the measurement setup, including the number of angular directions and measurement probes.

2. **rectTM_dece Dataset**: Similar to the rectTM_cent dataset, this dataset also involves measurements of the same metallic cylinder but with a different positioning relative to the measurement system.

I will then look at the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The paper cites the source of these datasets as follows:

- For the **rectTM_cent** and **rectTM_dece** datasets, the citation is:
  > K. Belkebir and M. Saillard, "Special section: testing inversion algorithms against experimental data," *Inverse Problems*, vol. 17, no. 6, pp. 1565-1571, Dec. 2001.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets in a structured manner, ensuring that I include the full citations as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
