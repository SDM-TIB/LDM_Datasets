To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Tasks That Language Models Donâ€™t Learn" by Bruce W. Lee and JaeHyuk Lim, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions an empirical investigation of visual-auditory properties of language through a series of tasks termed H-TEST. This suggests that there may be datasets associated with these tasks, so I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or benchmarks.

Next, I will review the **methodology** and **experiments** sections, as these typically contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the research. I will look for any specific tasks or datasets that are referenced in relation to the H-TEST.

In the **experiments section**, I will pay close attention to any tables or figures that summarize the tasks and their corresponding datasets. For instance, if there are tables that list the tasks involved in H-TEST, I will note down any datasets that are explicitly mentioned alongside these tasks.

After identifying potential datasets, I will check the **references section** of the paper to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to ensure that the datasets can be accessed or referenced by others.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like "H-TEST" or any specific tasks associated with it, I will look for the original source or publication that describes this dataset in detail. If the dataset is novel to this paper, I will note that as well.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the datasets into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset entry includes the name, description, and full citation.

Finally, I will double-check the accuracy of the citations and the descriptions to ensure they align with the information provided in the paper. This thorough approach will help me extract and document the datasets effectively.
