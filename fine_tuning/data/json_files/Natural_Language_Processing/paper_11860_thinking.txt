To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Artifacts Mapping: Multi-Modal Semantic Mapping for Object Detection and 3D Localization" by Federico Rollo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, which includes object detection and localization using multi-modal sensor fusion. This suggests that datasets may be involved, particularly for training or evaluation purposes.

Next, I will examine the **introduction section** for any mentions of specific datasets. The authors discuss the importance of semantic mapping and refer to various approaches in the literature, but I need to look for explicit dataset names or references.

In the **experiments section**, I will look for details about the datasets used for validation. The authors mention conducting experiments in both simulation and real environments, and they describe the objects used in these experiments. Specifically, they refer to objects like vases, couches, plants, and persons, which may indicate that they are using existing datasets or creating their own for the experiments.

I will also check the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. If the authors refer to established datasets, I will ensure to note the original papers that describe these datasets.

From my reading, I will identify the following datasets:

1. **COCO Dataset**: The authors mention using the COCO dataset for training their instance segmentation algorithms. The full citation for this dataset is:
   > T.-Y. Lin, M. Maire, S. Belongie, J. Hays, P. Perona, D. Ramanan, P. Doll√°r, and C. L. Zitnick. *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. In European Conference on Computer Vision, 2014.

2. **Gazebo Simulation Environments**: While not a traditional dataset, the authors utilize specific simulation environments (office and maze worlds) for their experiments. These environments are created for testing purposes and may not have a formal citation, but I will note their significance in the context of the experiments.

3. **Real-World Object Set**: The authors describe using various objects (umbrellas, chairs, cabinets, backpacks, TVs) in their real-world experiments. Similar to the simulation environments, these objects do not correspond to a formal dataset but are crucial for understanding the experimental setup.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for any datasets referenced in the paper. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, ready for further processing or review.
