To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Comprehensive Empirical Evaluation on Online Continual Learning" by Albin Soutif-Cormerais et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate methods on **Split-CIFAR100** and **Split-TinyImagenet** benchmarks, which suggests these are the datasets used in their experiments.

Next, I will look into **section 5 (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets. Here, they mention:

1. **Split-CIFAR100**: This dataset is derived from the CIFAR-100 dataset, which contains 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images, divided into 100 classes. The authors specify that they split this dataset into 20 tasks using a random class order.

2. **Split-TinyImagenet**: This dataset is a reduced version of the ImageNet dataset, containing 100,000 training images resized to 64x64 pixels and split into 200 classes. Similar to Split-CIFAR100, this dataset is also divided into 20 tasks.

To confirm the details and obtain full citations, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **CIFAR-100**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. Technical report, 2009.

- For **ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, and Li Fei-Fei. *Imagenet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In 2009 IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pages 248â€“255. IEEE, 2009.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and future reference. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations.
