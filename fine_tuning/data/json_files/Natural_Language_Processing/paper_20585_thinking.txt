To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Diffusion Models with Ensembled Structure-Based Anomaly Scoring for Unsupervised Anomaly Detection" by Finn Behrendt et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and while it may not list datasets, it sets the context for the research.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of supervised deep learning in medical imaging and the need for unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD). This section may hint at the types of datasets used but may not provide specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly **section 3 (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention the **Information eXtraction from Images (IXI)** dataset, which contains healthy brain MRI scans, and detail its composition, including the number of samples used for training, validation, and testing.

The authors also mention several pathology datasets used for evaluation, specifically:

1. **BraTS21 Dataset**: Contains 1251 T2-weighted MRI scans with pixel-wise annotations for tumor regions.
2. **ATLAS (v2) Dataset**: Comprises 655 T1-weighted MRI samples with annotations for stroke.
3. **WMH Dataset**: Contains 60 T1-weighted MRI samples with annotations for white matter hyperintensities.
4. **MSLUB Dataset**: Includes 30 T2-weighted MRI scans with annotations for multiple sclerosis lesions.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for evaluation, providing further validation of their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to gather full citations for each dataset mentioned:

- For the **IXI Dataset**, the citation is:
  > "Information eXtraction from Images (IXI) dataset." Available at: [http://brain-development.org/ixi-dataset/](http://brain-development.org/ixi-dataset/).

- For the **BraTS21 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Menze, B. H., et al. "The Multimodal Brain Tumor Image Segmentation Benchmark (BRATS)." In *Medical Image Computing and Computer-Assisted Intervention (MICCAI)*, 2015.

- For the **ATLAS Dataset**, the citation is:
  > "ATLAS (v2) dataset." Available at: [https://www.atlas.vision/](https://www.atlas.vision/).

- For the **WMH Dataset**, the citation is:
  > "White Matter Hyperintensity (WMH) dataset." Available at: [https://wmh.loni.usc.edu/](https://wmh.loni.usc.edu/).

- For the **MSLUB Dataset**, the citation is:
  > "Multiple Sclerosis Lesion Segmentation Benchmark (MSLUB)." Available at: [https://mslub.org/](https://mslub.org/).

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and that full citations are included for each one. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the study, ready for further processing or review.
