To extract datasets from the research paper titled "PV-SSD: A Multi-Modal Point Cloud 3D Object Detector based on Projection Features and Voxel Features" by Yongxin Shao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. In the abstract, the authors state that they validated their method on the **KITTI dataset** and the **ONCE dataset**. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for their experiments.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (Section IV) where the authors provide more details about the datasets used. Here, they explicitly mention:

1. **KITTI Dataset**: The authors describe it as having 7,481 training samples and 7,518 test samples, divided into a training set and a validation set. They mention that they conducted experiments on the 'Car' and 'Cyclist' classes and evaluated results using average precision (AP) and IoU thresholds.

2. **ONCE Dataset**: The authors state that they used six sequences for training and four sequences for validation. They also mention that the dataset is divided into four evaluation levels based on the distance of objects, with metrics including Average Precision (AP) and Mean Average Precision (mAP).

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **KITTI dataset**, the citation is:
  > A. Geiger, P. Lenz, and R. Urtasun. *Are we ready for autonomous driving? The KITTI vision benchmark suite*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2012, pp. 3354â€“3361.

- For the **ONCE dataset**, the citation is:
  > J. Mao, M. Niu, C. Jiang, H. Liang, J. Chen, X. Liang, Y. Li, C. Ye, W. Zhang, Z. Li et al. *One million scenes for autonomous driving: ONCE dataset*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2106.11037, 2021.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
