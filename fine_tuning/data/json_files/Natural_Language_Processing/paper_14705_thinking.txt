To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Probing Large Language Models from A Human Behavioral Perspective" by Xintong Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, related work, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the use of eye-tracking measures, which suggests that datasets related to human behavior may be involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of understanding LLMs and mention that there is a lack of work utilizing certain datasets to probe LLMs. This indicates that datasets are indeed relevant to their research.

Next, I will focus on the **related work section**, where the authors explicitly list several datasets used in cognitive and psycholinguistic studies. They mention:

1. **ZuCo 1.0**: Referenced as a dataset in the context of eye-tracking studies.
2. **ZuCo 2.0**: This dataset is described in detail, indicating it contains eye-tracking records during reading activities.
3. **GECO**: Another dataset mentioned for eye-tracking research.
4. **Provo**: A dataset that is also referenced in relation to eye-tracking measures.

In the **experiments section**, the authors confirm that they utilized the **ZuCo 2.0 dataset** for their analysis, which solidifies its relevance to their study.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset from the **References section** of the paper:

- For **ZuCo 1.0**, the citation is:
  > Hollenstein, N., Troendle, M., Zhang, C., & Langer, N. (2018). ZuCo, a simultaneous EEG and eye-tracking resource for natural sentence reading. *Scientific Data*, 5(1), 1-13.

- For **ZuCo 2.0**, the citation is:
  > Hollenstein, N., Troendle, M., Zhang, C., & Langer, N. (2019). ZuCo 2.0: A dataset of physiological recordings during natural reading and annotation. *arXiv preprint arXiv:1912.00903*.

- For **GECO**, the citation is:
  > Cop, U., Dirix, N., Drieghe, D., & Duyck, W. (2017). Presenting GECO: An eye-tracking corpus of monolingual and bilingual sentence reading. *Behavior Research Methods*, 49, 602-615.

- For **Provo**, the citation is:
  > Luke, S. G., & Christianson, K. (2018). The Provo corpus: A large eye-tracking corpus with predictability norms. *Behavior Research Methods*, 50, 826-833.

After compiling this information, I will ensure that each dataset is clearly documented with its citation, ready for inclusion in the structured output format as required. This thorough approach guarantees that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.
