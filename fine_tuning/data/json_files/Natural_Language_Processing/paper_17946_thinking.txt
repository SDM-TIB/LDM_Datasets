To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Generalized Planning for the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus" by Chao Lei, Nir Lipovetzky, and Krista A. Ehinger, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the "Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC)" as a benchmark for evaluating the proposed ARC solver. This indicates that the ARC is a dataset of interest.

Next, I will look for specific sections that might detail the datasets used in the experiments. In this case, I will focus on the **experiments** section, where the authors typically describe the datasets utilized for their evaluations. 

Upon reviewing the **experiments** section, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, descriptions, and any relevant details about their structure or content. The authors mention using a subset of 160 object-centric ARC tasks introduced by Xu, Khalil, and Sanner (2023). This indicates that the ARC dataset is central to their experiments.

Now, I will check the **references** section to find the full citation for the ARC dataset. The authors reference the original paper that introduced the ARC, which is crucial for providing the proper citation.

The citation for the ARC dataset is:
> Chollet, F. (2019). *On the Measure of Intelligence*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1911.01547.

Additionally, I will note that the authors also reference Xu, Khalil, and Sanner (2023) in relation to the subset of tasks they used. The citation for this paper is:
> Xu, Y., Khalil, E. B., & Sanner, S. (2023). *Graphs, Constraints, and Search for the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus*. In Proceedings of the 37th AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, AAAI, 4115â€“4122.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets identified:

1. **Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC)**: A benchmark dataset consisting of 1000 unique tasks that require abstract reasoning and visual understanding.

2. **Subset of ARC tasks (160 object-centric tasks)**: A specific subset of the ARC used for evaluation in the experiments.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries with their full citations, ensuring that each dataset is clearly documented for future reference or use.
