To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ELCC: the Emergent Language Corpus Collection" by Brendon Boldt and David Mortensen, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and content sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract introduces the Emergent Language Corpus Collection (ELCC) and hints at the existence of multiple corpora collected from various emergent communication systems.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Content)**, which is likely to provide detailed descriptions of the datasets included in the ELCC. Here, I will look for specific names of the datasets, their characteristics, and any relevant metadata that describes their structure and purpose.

In **section 4.1 (Scope)**, the authors discuss the types of emergent communication systems represented in the ELCC. I will note any specific datasets mentioned, such as "babyai-sr/GoToObj" and "generalizations-mu-goodman/cub-concept," as these are likely to be part of the collection.

I will also check **section 4.2 (Signalling games)** and **section 4.3 (Other games)** for additional datasets that may be referenced in the context of different types of games or experiments conducted within the emergent communication framework.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for each dataset's origin.

For example, I will look for citations related to:
- The "babyai" datasets, which may reference the original authors or papers that introduced these datasets.
- The "generalizations-mu-goodman" datasets, which will also have associated citations.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets extracted from the paper.

Finally, I will organize the dataset information clearly and concisely, ready for any further processing or review.
