To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Making Recommender Systems More Knowledgeable: A Framework to Incorporate Side Information" by Yukun Jiang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant details, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and dataset sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on several models and datasets, which indicates that there are datasets to be identified.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Dataset)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used in their experiments. They mention four datasets:

1. **Diginetica**: This dataset is described as containing user session data extracted from an e-commerce search engine's logs. The authors note that they used a specific preprocessing script to prepare this dataset for their experiments.

2. **Last.FM**: This dataset consists of user listening habits represented as tuples of user, timestamp, artist, and song. The authors specify that this dataset is used primarily for baseline comparisons.

3. **MovieLens**: This is a well-known movie rating dataset that includes user ID, item ID, timestamp, and rating. The authors mention that it also contains genre information, which is relevant for their experiments.

4. **Ta Feng**: This dataset contains transaction data from a grocery store in China, including features like transaction date, customer ID, and product subclass.

After identifying these datasets, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The citations I will extract are:

- For **Diginetica**, the citation is:
  > Priyanka Gupta, Diksha Garg, Pankaj Malhotra, Lovekesh Vig, and Gautam Shroff. *Niser: Normalized item and session representations to handle popularity bias*. 2021.

- For **Last.FM**, the citation is:
  > Ocelma. *Last.fm Dataset*. Available at: http://ocelma.net/MusicRecommendationDataset/lastfm-360K.html.

- For **MovieLens**, the citation is:
  > GroupLens Research. *MovieLens Dataset*. Available at: https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/.

- For **Ta Feng**, the citation is:
  > Chiranjiv Das. *Ta Feng Grocery Dataset*. Available at: https://www.kaggle.com/chiranjivdas09/ta-feng-grocery-dataset.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured all necessary details for each dataset mentioned in the paper.
