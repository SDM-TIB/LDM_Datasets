To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Inner-IoU: More Effective Intersection over Union Loss with Auxiliary Bounding Box" by Hao Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, method, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the introduction of Inner-IoU loss and its application in bounding box regression, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the subsequent sections.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of bounding box regression in object detection but do not specify any datasets. I will continue to the **method** section, where they describe their approach in detail, but again, no datasets are mentioned.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section**. Here, the authors conduct experiments using various datasets to validate their proposed method. They mention using the **PASCAL VOC** dataset and the **AI-TOD** dataset for their experiments.

1. **PASCAL VOC Dataset**: This dataset is widely used for object detection tasks. The authors mention that they used the VOC2007 trainval and VOC2012 trainval as the training set and VOC2007 test as the test set. This dataset consists of 16,551 images for training and 4,952 images for testing, covering 20 object categories.

2. **AI-TOD Dataset**: The authors describe the AI-TOD dataset as containing 28,036 aerial images with 8 types of targets and 700,621 object instances. They split the dataset into 14,018 images for training and 14,018 images for testing.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **PASCAL VOC dataset**, the citation is:
  > M. Everingham, L. Van Gool, C. K. I. Williams, J. Winn, and A. Zisserman. "The PASCAL Visual Object Classes (VOC) Challenge." *International Journal of Computer Vision*, vol. 88, pp. 303-338, 2010.

- For the **AI-TOD dataset**, the citation is:
  > Jinwang Wang, Wen Yang, Haowen Guo, Ruixiang Zhang, Gui-Song Xia. "Tiny object detection in aerial images." In *2020 25th International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR)*, IEEE, 2021, pp. 3791-3798.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will allow for a comprehensive understanding of the datasets used in the research and their significance in the context of the proposed method.
