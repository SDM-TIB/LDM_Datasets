To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SurMo: Surface-based 4D Motion Modeling for Dynamic Human Rendering" by Tao Hu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments on three datasets, which indicates that there are specific datasets to look for.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they refer to three datasets:

1. **ZJU-MoCap**: This dataset is mentioned as containing sequences of multiple subjects, specifically noting that it includes sequences S313, S315, S377, S386, S387, and S394.

2. **MPII-RDDC**: This dataset is also referenced, indicating that it is used for evaluating the performance of the proposed method.

3. **AIST++**: The authors mention this dataset in the context of rendering fast motions, indicating its relevance to their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each of these datasets:

- For **ZJU-MoCap**, the citation is:
  > G. Varol, J. Romero, X. Martin, Naureen Mahmood, Michael J. Black, I. Laptev, and C. Schmid. *Learning from synthetic humans*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 4627–4635, 2017.

- For **MPII-RDDC**, the citation is:
  > Marc Habermann, Lingjie Liu, Weipeng Xu, Michael Zollhoefer, Gerard Pons-Moll, and Christian Theobalt. *Real-time deep dynamic characters*. ACM Transactions on Graphics (TOG), 40:1 – 16, 2021.

- For **AIST++**, the citation is:
  > Ruilong Li, Shan Yang, David A. Ross, and Angjoo Kanazawa. *Learn to dance with AIST++: Music conditioned 3D dance generation*. 2021.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and that the full citations are included. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research, ready for further processing or review.
