To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Measure for Transparent Comparison of Linguistic Diversity in Multilingual NLP Data Sets" by Tanja Samardžić et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors analyze a range of popular multilingual datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be discussed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **methods and results sections**, particularly looking for any explicit mentions of datasets used for evaluation. In the paper, the authors list several datasets in **Table 1**, which includes the following datasets:

1. **Universal Dependencies (UD)**: This dataset is widely used for syntactic parsing across multiple languages.
2. **Bible 100**: A multilingual dataset containing translations of the Bible in 100 languages.
3. **mBERT**: A multilingual BERT model trained on a diverse set of languages.
4. **XTREME**: A benchmark for evaluating cross-lingual generalization across multiple tasks.
5. **XGLUE**: A benchmark dataset for cross-lingual understanding and generation.
6. **XNLI**: A multilingual dataset for natural language inference.
7. **XCOPA**: A dataset for causal common-sense reasoning across languages.
8. **TyDiQA**: A benchmark for information-seeking question answering in diverse languages.
9. **XQuAD**: A dataset for cross-lingual question answering.
10. **TeDDi**: A text data diversity sample for language comparison and multilingual NLP.

I will then look for the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and will be formatted as follows:

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This structured approach will help in creating a comprehensive overview of the datasets discussed in the paper.
