To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An Empirical Study on Fertility Proposals Using Multi-Grained Topic Analysis Methods" by Yuilin Zhou, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the analysis of microblog comments related to a specific proposal, which suggests that there may be a dataset derived from social media comments.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Data collection and analysis)**, where the author describes the data collection process. Here, it is stated that comments were collected from **Sina Weibo** under the topic of “Suggesting the cancellation of marriage restrictions on birth registration.” This indicates that the dataset consists of 12,509 comments from this social media platform.

I will also look for any additional datasets mentioned in the **results or discussion sections**. However, the primary dataset appears to be the comments collected from Sina Weibo, as there are no other datasets explicitly mentioned in the paper.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. Since the dataset is derived from comments on a social media platform, it may not have a formal citation like traditional datasets. However, I can note the source as follows:

- **Sina Weibo Comments Dataset**: This dataset consists of comments collected from the Sina Weibo platform regarding the proposal to abolish marriage restrictions on birth registration. The dataset is not formally cited in the references, but it is derived from user-generated content on the platform.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring to include the source and any relevant details about the dataset, such as the number of comments and the context of the data collection.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entry for review or further processing.
