To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Addressing Topic Granularity and Hallucination in Large Language Models for Topic Modelling" by Yida Mu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental settings sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, and the introduction often outlines the datasets used for experiments.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of using LLMs for topic modeling and mention that they will evaluate their methods on several datasets. This indicates that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experimental Settings)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention:

1. **20 News Groups (20NG) dataset**: This is described as an open-domain dataset containing documents across 20 categories, widely recognized as a benchmark for various NLP tasks.

2. **20NG Specific**: A subset of the 20NG dataset that includes documents specifically related to the 'Recreation' news category.

3. **Wiki dataset**: This dataset includes 14,000 Wikipedia articles annotated into one of 15 general categories.

4. **Bills dataset**: This dataset comprises summaries of 33,000 bills from the 110th to the 114th U.S. Congresses, annotated with 21 general topics by humans.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

The citations I will extract are:

- For the **20 News Groups (20NG) dataset**:
  > Jason Rennie, Shih-Fu Chang, and Yiming Yang. *TREC-2007: The 20 Newsgroups Dataset*. 2007. Available at: http://qwone.com/~jason/20Newsgroups/

- For the **Wiki dataset**:
  > Stephen Merity, Nitish Shirish Keskar, and Richard Socher. *Regularizing and optimizing LSTM language models*. In International Conference on Learning Representations, 2018. Available at: https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.02182

- For the **Bills dataset**:
  > E Scott Adler and John Wilkerson. *Congressional bills project: 1995-2018*. 2018. Available at: https://www.congressionalbills.org/

- For the **20NG Specific dataset**, since it is a subset of the 20NG dataset, I will reference it as part of the 20NG citation.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and attributed correctly. This will allow for a structured output that can be used for further analysis or sharing with others interested in the research.
