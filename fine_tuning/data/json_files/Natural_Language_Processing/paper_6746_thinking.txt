To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Beyond Static Models and Test Sets: Benchmarking the Potential of Pre-trained Models Across Tasks and Languages" by Kabir Ahuja et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets along with their full citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of multilingual NLP benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors mention a case study on four different multilingual datasets. This indicates that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

In the **case study section (Section 4)**, the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. I will carefully note the names and descriptions of these datasets:

1. **PAWS-X**: A cross-lingual adversarial dataset for paraphrase identification, which includes multiple languages.
2. **XNLI**: A multilingual dataset for natural language inference, which is designed to evaluate cross-lingual sentence representations.
3. **XQUAD**: A dataset for cross-lingual extractive question answering, which includes questions and answers in multiple languages.
4. **TyDiQA-GoldP**: A benchmark for information-seeking question answering in typologically diverse languages.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **PAWS-X**, the citation is:
  > Yinfei Yang, Yuan Zhang, Chris Tar, and Jason Baldridge. *PAWS-X: A cross-lingual adversarial dataset for paraphrase identification*. In Proceedings of EMNLP 2019, pages 3685–3690.

- For **XNLI**, the citation is:
  > Alexis Conneau, Ruty Rinott, Guillaume Lample, Adina Williams, Samuel Bowman, Holger Schwenk, and Veselin Stoyanov. *XNLI: Evaluating cross-lingual sentence representations*. In Proceedings of the 2018 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 2475–2485.

- For **XQUAD**, the citation is:
  > Mikel Artetxe, Sebastian Ruder, and Dani Yogatama. *On the Cross-lingual Transferability of Monolingual Representations*. In Proceedings of ACL 2020.

- For **TyDiQA-GoldP**, the citation is:
  > Jennimaria Palomaki, Eunsol Choi, Michael Collins, Dan Garrette, Tom Kwiatkowski, Vitaly Nikolaev, and Jonathan H. Clark. *TyDi QA: A benchmark for information-seeking question answering in typologically diverse languages*. In Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics, 2020.

Now that I have the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets along with their authoritative references.
