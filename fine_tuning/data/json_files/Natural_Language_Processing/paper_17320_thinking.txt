To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The Audio-Visual Conversational Graph: From an Egocentric-Exocentric Perspective" by Wenqi Jia et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors validate their method on a challenging egocentric video dataset, which suggests that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 3.2 (Dataset and Annotations)**, where the authors explicitly mention the dataset they used. Here, they refer to the **Egocentric Concurrent Conversations Dataset**, which contains data collected from 50 participants in various conversational scenarios. The authors provide details about the dataset, including the number of participants, the duration of the recordings, and the equipment used.

In this section, they also explain how they repurpose the dataset for their specific task, which involves generating ground-truth labels for conversational interactions. This confirms that the **Egocentric Concurrent Conversations Dataset** is the primary dataset used in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The citation for the **Egocentric Concurrent Conversations Dataset** is as follows:
> Fiona Ryan, Hao Jiang, Abhinav Shukla, James M Rehg, and Vamsi Krishna Ithapu. *Egocentric Auditory Attention Localization in Conversations*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 14663â€“14674, 2023.

Since this is the only dataset explicitly mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the dataset.

After gathering all the necessary details, I will prepare the dataset entry for review or further processing, ensuring that it is clear and complete.
