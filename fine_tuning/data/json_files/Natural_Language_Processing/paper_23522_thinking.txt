To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Discovering Dynamic Symbolic Policies with Genetic Programming" by Sigur de Vries et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract provides a general overview of the research but may not specify datasets. The introduction may mention datasets used for experiments or comparisons, so I will pay close attention to any specific names or descriptions.

Next, I will examine the **methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the experimental setup. This section often contains explicit mentions of datasets used for training or testing the models. I will look for any specific environments or datasets that are referenced, such as the "stochastic harmonic oscillator," "acrobot," and "continuous stirred tank reactor," as these may imply the use of specific datasets or simulation environments.

In the **results section**, I will check for any additional mentions of datasets, especially if the authors discuss the performance of their methods on different datasets or environments. This may provide further context or specific names of datasets that were utilized.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to ensure that the datasets can be accessed or referenced correctly in future work.

For example, if I find that the paper mentions the "stochastic harmonic oscillator" as a dataset or experimental environment, I will look for the original source or citation that describes this dataset in detail. Similarly, I will do the same for the "acrobot" and "continuous stirred tank reactor" environments.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation as found in the references section of the paper.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets used in the research paper, providing a clear and comprehensive overview of the data sources that underpin the study's findings.
