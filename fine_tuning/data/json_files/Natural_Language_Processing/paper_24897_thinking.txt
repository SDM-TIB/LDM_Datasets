To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Generalists vs. Specialists: Evaluating Large Language Models for Urdu" by Samee Arif et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the paper evaluates various models on classification and generation tasks, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Datasets)**, which is explicitly dedicated to datasets. This section is likely to provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used for both classification and generation tasks. I will carefully extract the names, descriptions, and any relevant details about each dataset.

In **subsection 3.1 (Classification)**, the following datasets are mentioned:

1. **Urdu IMDB Sentiment Analysis Dataset**: A translated version of the original IMDB dataset, comprising 50,000 movie reviews.
   - Citation: Maas, A. L., Daly, R. E., Pham, P. T., Huang, D., Ng, A. Y., & Potts, C. (2011). Learning word vectors for sentiment analysis. In Proceedings of the 49th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies (pp. 142-150).

2. **Abuse Detection Dataset**: Includes datasets by Akhter et al. (2020) with 2,171 entries and Amjad et al. (2022) with 3,502 entries.

5. **UQA Dataset**: Consists of 88,829 answerable questions.

In **subsection 3.2 (Generation)**, I will extract datasets used for generation tasks, such as:

1. **XSUMUrdu Dataset**: A summarization dataset with 76,626 entries.
   - Citation: Munaf, M., Afzal, H., Iltaf, N., & Mahmood, K. (2023). Low resource summarization using pre-trained language models. Preprint, arXiv:2310.02790.

2. **Dakshina Dataset**: Used for transliteration, containing 11,464 sentences.

3. **OPUS-100 Dataset**: Used for translation tasks, containing 755,526 sentences.
   - Citation: Zhang, B., Williams, P., Titov, I., & Sennrich, R. (2020). Improving massively multilingual neural machine translation and zero-shot translation. In Proceedings of the 58th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (pp. 1628-1639).

4. **UrduAssistant Dataset**: Contains 67,017 prompts translated to Urdu.
   - Citation: Khalil, M. (2023). UrduAssistant dataset. Retrieved from https://huggingface.co/datasets/mwz/UrduAssistant.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries along with their full citations to ensure that they are accurately represented for any further processing or review.
