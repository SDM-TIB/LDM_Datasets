To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Offline Recommender System Evaluation under Unobserved Confounding" by Olivier Jeunen and Ben London, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's focus on off-policy estimation methods and mentions the use of synthetic data for empirical validation. This suggests that there may be datasets involved, particularly synthetic datasets.

Next, I will examine the **methodology and experiments sections**. In this paper, the authors describe a guiding example that utilizes synthetic data to illustrate the effects of unobserved confounding. Specifically, they mention that they simulate an off-policy estimation setup with a dataset consisting of 2 million samples drawn from a synthetic distribution. However, they do not provide a specific name for this dataset, as it is generated for the purpose of the study.

I will also look for any references to publicly available datasets in the **experiments section**. However, the paper primarily focuses on synthetic data and does not mention any external datasets used for validation or comparison.

Now, I will check the **References section** for any datasets that might be cited indirectly through the works of others. The references include various studies related to off-policy evaluation and confounding, but they do not explicitly mention any datasets that were used in this paper.

Since the paper does not provide specific datasets with names or citations, I will summarize the findings as follows:

1. **Synthetic Dataset**: The authors created a synthetic dataset for their experiments, which consists of 2 million samples. However, there is no formal citation for this dataset since it is not a publicly available dataset but rather generated for the study.

In conclusion, while the paper discusses the use of synthetic data, it does not reference any external datasets with full citations. Therefore, I will note that the primary dataset used is synthetic and does not have a formal citation. 

I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and future reference.
