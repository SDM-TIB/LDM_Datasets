To extract datasets from the research paper titled "K-Space-Aware Cross-Modality Score for Quality Assessment of Synthesized Neuroimages" by Guoyang Xie et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the construction of a large-scale multi-modal neuroimaging perceptual similarity (NIRPS) dataset, which indicates that this is a key dataset used in the research.

Next, I will look into **section 4 (NIRPS Dataset and Radiologist Score)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the NIRPS dataset. They state that it includes 6,000 assessments from radiologists and is composed of three subsets generated by different models (CycleGAN, MUNIT, and UNIT). This section will provide specifics about the dataset's structure and purpose.

In this section, the authors also describe the **IXI dataset** and the **BraTS2021 dataset**. The IXI dataset is mentioned as containing nearly 600 MR images from healthy subjects, while the BraTS2021 dataset is noted for its multi-institutional MRI sequences for brain disease analysis.

I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **NIRPS Dataset**: A large-scale multi-modal neuroimaging perceptual similarity dataset with 6,000 radiologist judgments. It is used to evaluate the quality of synthesized neuroimages.
   - Citation: Not explicitly provided in the paper, but it is a key dataset constructed by the authors.

2. **IXI Dataset**: Contains nearly 600 MR images from normal and healthy subjects, including T1, T2, and PD-weighted images.
   - Citation: Aljabar, P., Wolz, R., Srinivasan, L., Counsell, S.J., Rutherford, M.A., Edwards, A.D., Hajnal, J.V., Rueckert, D. (2011). "A combined manifold learning analysis of shape and appearance to characterize neonatal brain development." *IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging*, 30, 2072â€“2086.

3. **BraTS2021 Dataset**: Designed for the analysis and diagnosis of brain diseases, including 1251 training cases and 219 validation cases with four MRI sequences (T1, T2, T1ce, and FLAIR).
   - Citation: Bakas, S., Kuijf, H.J., Menze, B.H., Reyes, M. (2017). "Brainlesion: Glioma, multiple sclerosis, stroke and traumatic brain injuries." In *Lecture Notes in Computer Science*.

After identifying these datasets, I will ensure to note their significance in the context of the research and how they contribute to the evaluation of the proposed K-CROSS metric.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations into a structured format for further processing or review.
