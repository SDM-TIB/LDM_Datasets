To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Channel Prior Convolutional Attention for Medical Image Segmentation" by Hejun Huang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the proposed method, CPCANet, is validated on two publicly available datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any relevant sections that discuss the datasets used for validation. In this case, the **Experiments and Results** section (specifically section 4.1) provides detailed information about the datasets.

In section 4.1, the authors mention two datasets:

1. **Automated Cardiac Diagnosis (ACDC) Dataset**: This dataset consists of 100 samples, each containing images of the diastole and systole phases of the heart. After preprocessing, it yields a total of 1,902 slices, with specific splits for training, validation, and testing.

2. **Skin Lesion Segmentation Datasets (ISIC-2016 and PH2)**: The ISIC-2016 dataset contains 900 samples for lesion segmentation from dermoscopic images. The PH2 dataset is used as a test set, and the evaluation metrics are specified.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the **References section** of the paper:

- For the **ACDC dataset**, the citation is:
  > Bernard, O., Lalande, A., Zotti, C., Cervenansky, F., Yang, X., Heng, P.A., Cetin, I., Lekadir, K., Camara, O., Ballester, M.A.G. (2018). Deep learning techniques for automatic MRI cardiac multi-structures segmentation and diagnosis: is the problem solved? *IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging*, 37(11), 2514-2525. doi:10.1109/TMI.2018.2837502.

- For the **ISIC-2016 dataset**, the citation is:
  > Gutman, D., Codella, N.C., Celebi, E., Helba, B., Marchetti, M., Mishra, N., Halpern, A. (2016). Skin lesion analysis toward melanoma detection: A challenge at the International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI) 2016, hosted by the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC). *arXiv preprint arXiv:1605.01397*. doi:10.48550/arXiv.1605.01397.

- For the **PH2 dataset**, the citation is:
  > Barata, C., Ruela, M., Francisco, M., Mendon√ßa, T., Marques, J.S. (2014). Two systems for the detection of melanomas in dermoscopy images using texture and color features. *IEEE Systems Journal*, 8(3), 965-979. doi:10.1109/JSYST.2013.2271540.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets and their citations clearly, ensuring that I have accurately captured all necessary details for future reference or processing.
