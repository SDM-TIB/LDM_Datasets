To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "Localized Questions in Medical Visual Question Answering" by Sergio Tascon-Morales et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant details, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on three datasets, which is a strong indication that I will find specific dataset names and descriptions later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experiments and Results)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, they describe three datasets:

1. **DME-VQA**: This dataset consists of 679 fundus images with a total of 9,779 question-answer pairs for training, 2,380 for validation, and 1,311 for testing. The questions include both those about the entire image and those about specific regions.

2. **RIS-VQA**: This dataset is derived from the 2017 Robotic Instrument Segmentation dataset and contains 15,580 question-answer pairs from 1,423 images for training, 3,930 for validation, and 13,052 for testing. The questions are binary and pertain to the presence of specific instruments in defined regions.

3. **INSEGCAT-VQA**: This dataset is based on frames from cataract surgery videos and includes 29,380 question-answer pairs from 3,519 images for training, 5,306 for validation, and 4,322 for testing. Similar to RIS-VQA, it features binary questions about the presence of instruments.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **DME-VQA**, the citation is:

Soda (Eds.), 33rd IEEE International Symposium on Computer-Based Medical Systems, CBMS 2020, Rochester, MN, USA, July 28-30, 2020 (pp. 565–568). IEEE.

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
