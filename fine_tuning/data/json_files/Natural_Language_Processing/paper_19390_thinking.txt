To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Reward Bound for Behavioral Guarantee of Model-Based Planning Agents" by Zhiyu An et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses behavioral guarantees for model-based planning agents but does not explicitly mention any datasets.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section. Here, the authors discuss the integration of machine learning-driven agents and the importance of behavioral guarantees, but again, there are no specific datasets mentioned.

I will then check the **main result** section and the subsequent sections for any references to datasets. The paper primarily focuses on theoretical results and does not seem to reference any empirical experiments that would typically involve datasets.

Since there are no explicit mentions of datasets in the sections I have reviewed, I will also look at the **acknowledgements** and **references** sections to see if any datasets are indirectly referenced or if any related works are cited that might involve datasets.

In the **references**, I find citations to various works, but none of them appear to be datasets themselves. They are primarily papers discussing concepts related to reinforcement learning and model-based planning.

After thoroughly reviewing the entire paper, it appears that this research does not utilize any specific datasets for its theoretical analysis. Therefore, I conclude that there are no datasets to extract from this paper.

Since I have not identified any datasets, I will not be able to provide full citations for datasets as there are none present in this work. My final step will be to summarize my findings, noting the absence of datasets in this particular research paper.
