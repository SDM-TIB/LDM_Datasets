To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Adapting Multi-objectivized Software Configuration Tuning" by Tao Chen and Miqing Li, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will look for any references to datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets in detail. In this paper, the authors mention conducting experiments on several real-world systems and objectives. I will look for specific names of datasets or systems that are used for evaluation.

In the **results and analysis section**, the authors may refer to specific datasets again when discussing their findings. I will take note of any datasets mentioned in the context of performance metrics or comparisons with other methods.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial as it provides the necessary context and source for the datasets used in the research.

From the paper, I can identify the following datasets:

1. **MariaDB**: Used for runtime and CPU load performance objectives.
   - Citation: Chen, T., & Li, M. (2024). Adapting Multi-objectivized Software Configuration Tuning. *Proc. ACM Softw. Eng.*, 1(FSE), Article 25. https://doi.org/10.1145/3643751

2. **Storm**: Used for throughput and latency performance objectives.
   - Citation: Chen, T., & Li, M. (2024). Adapting Multi-objectivized Software Configuration Tuning. *Proc. ACM Softw. Eng.*, 1(FSE), Article 25. https://doi.org/10.1145/3643751

3. **VP9**: Used for runtime and CPU load performance objectives.

5. **MongoDB**: Used for runtime and CPU load performance objectives.
   - Citation: Chen, T., & Li, M. (2024). Adapting Multi-objectivized Software Configuration Tuning. *Proc. ACM Softw. Eng.*, 1(FSE), Article 25. https://doi.org/10.1145/3643751

6. **x264**: Used for PSNR and energy consumption performance objectives.
   - Citation: Chen, T., & Li, M. (2024). Adapting Multi-objectivized Software Configuration Tuning. *Proc. ACM Softw. Eng.*, 1(FSE), Article 25. https://doi.org/10.1145/3643751

7. **LLVM**: Used for runtime and CPU load performance objectives.
   - Citation: Chen, T., & Li, M. (2024). Adapting Multi-objectivized Software Configuration Tuning. *Proc. ACM Softw. Eng.*, 1(FSE), Article 25. https://doi.org/10.1145/3643751

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or analysis. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their sources as required.
