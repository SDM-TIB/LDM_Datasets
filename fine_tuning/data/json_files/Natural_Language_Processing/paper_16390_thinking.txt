To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Exploring Artificial Intelligence Methods for Energy Prediction in Healthcare Facilities: An In-Depth Extended Systematic Review" by Marjan FatehiJananloo et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and findings sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study reviews articles that employed machine learning and AI techniques for predicting energy consumption in hospitals, which suggests that various datasets may be referenced.

Next, I will focus on the **literature review methodology section**, where the authors describe their systematic review process. They mention that they identified 1884 publications and narrowed them down to 17 relevant articles. I will look for any specific datasets used in these articles, particularly in the context of energy consumption prediction in healthcare facilities.

In the **findings section**, the authors discuss various data inputs influencing energy prediction, such as occupancy data and meteorological data. I will check if they provide specific datasets or references to datasets used in the studies they reviewed.

I will also examine the **tables and figures** included in the paper, particularly Table 1 and Table 2, which summarize the studies and data types used. These tables may contain references to specific datasets or the types of data collected in the reviewed studies.

Once I identify any datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to ensure that the datasets can be accessed for further research.

For example, if I find that the authors reference the "EnergyPlus" dataset or any specific datasets from the reviewed articles, I will note down the full citation for each. 

After gathering all relevant information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited according to the references provided in the paper.

This structured approach will help ensure that I extract all necessary datasets and their citations effectively.
