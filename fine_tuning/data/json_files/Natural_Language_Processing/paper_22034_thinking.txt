To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Survey on Vision Mamba: Models, Applications and Challenges" by Rui Xu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and application sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a high-level overview of the paper's focus, while the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the research, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will pay particular attention to **section IV (Applications)**, as this section categorizes various applications of the Mamba model across different modalities. It is likely to mention specific datasets used in the experiments or evaluations of the models discussed.

In the **applications section**, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets. For instance, the authors may refer to datasets used for image classification, segmentation, or video analysis. I will note down the names of these datasets and any relevant details provided about them.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets themselves.

For example, if the paper mentions the "ImageNet" dataset, I would look for its citation in the references, which might look something like this:
> J. Deng, W. Dong, R. Socher, L. Li, K. Li, and L. Fei-Fei. "ImageNet: A large-scale hierarchical image database." In CVPR, 2009, pp. 248â€“255.

Once I have gathered all the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly presents each dataset along with its citation.

Finally, I will ensure that all entries are accurate and complete, ready for any further processing or review.
