To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Neural Machine Translation with Dynamic Graph Convolutional Decoder" by Lei Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets used in the study.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments on five widely acknowledged translation benchmarks. This indicates that there are specific datasets involved, which I need to identify.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In the provided text, I see that the authors explicitly mention evaluating their model on five translation benchmarks. I will need to locate the exact names of these datasets.

Upon reviewing the **experiments section**, I find that the authors list the datasets as follows:

1. **NIST Chinese-English**: This dataset is used for the Chinese-English translation task and is part of the NIST OpenMT's translation task.
2. **WAT 2016 Japanese-English**: This dataset is used for the Japanese-English translation task and is derived from the ASPEC corpus.
3. **WAT 2016 English-Japanese**: This dataset is also from the ASPEC corpus but is used for the English-Japanese translation task.
4. **WMT 2017 Chinese-English**: This dataset is used for the Chinese-English translation task and consists of a large number of sentence pairs.
5. **WMT 2017 English-German**: This dataset is used for the English-German translation task and includes a substantial amount of training data.

Now, I will check the **references section** to gather the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper documentation.

- For the **NIST Chinese-English dataset**, the citation is:
  > NIST. (2005). *NIST OpenMT Chinese-English Translation Task*. Retrieved from [NIST website].

- For the **ASPEC corpus**, which includes both the Japanese-English and English-Japanese datasets, the citation is:
  > Nakazawa, T., Yaguchi, M., Uchimoto, K., Utiyama, M., Sumita, E., Kurohashi, S., & Isahara, H. (2016). *ASPEC: Asian Scientific Paper Excerpt Corpus*. In Proceedings of the Tenth International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC’16), pages 2204–2208.

- For the **WMT 2017 datasets**, the citation is:
  > WMT. (2017). *WMT 2017 Translation Task*. Retrieved from [WMT website].

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited.

In summary, I will extract the datasets by:
1. Reading the abstract and introduction for initial mentions.
2. Identifying the datasets in the experiments section.
3. Collecting full citations from the references section.
4. Documenting each dataset with its citation for clarity and completeness.
