To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Metalearning with Very Few Samples Per Task" by Maryam Aliakbarpour et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections that discuss experiments or datasets**. The abstract provides a general overview, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the research, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will focus on **section 1 (Introduction)**, where the authors might mention specific datasets used for their experiments. If they refer to any datasets, I will note their names and any relevant details provided.

I will then examine **section 4 (Metalearning)**, particularly subsections that might detail the datasets used in their experiments. This section is likely to contain explicit mentions of datasets, including their characteristics and how they were utilized in the study.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily.

For example, if the authors mention using the **MNIST dataset**, I would look for its citation in the references, which typically includes the authors, title, conference or journal name, and year of publication.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the datasets into a structured format, ensuring that each entry includes:

1. The name of the dataset.
2. A brief description of the dataset, including its purpose and any relevant details (e.g., number of samples, types of tasks).
3. The full citation for the dataset as found in the references.

Finally, I will ensure that the information is clear and concise, making it easy for others to understand the datasets used in the research and their significance in the context of the study.
