To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Achieving Linear Speedup in Asynchronous Federated Learning with Heterogeneous Clients" by Xiaolu Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions "extensive numerical experiments using real datasets," which suggests that datasets are indeed used, but I need to find their specific names.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** in detail. In this section, the authors describe their experimental setup, including the datasets used for training and evaluation. They specifically mention using **FashionMNIST** and **CIFAR-10** datasets for image classification tasks. 

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **FashionMNIST**, the citation is:
  > Xiao, H., Rasul, K., & Vollgraf, R. (2017). *Fashion-MNIST: A novel image dataset for benchmarking machine learning algorithms*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1708.07747.

- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
  > Krizhevsky, A., & Hinton, G. (2009). *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. 

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use.

In summary, the datasets extracted from the paper are:
1. **FashionMNIST**
   - Citation: Xiao, H., Rasul, K., & Vollgraf, R. (2017). *Fashion-MNIST: A novel image dataset for benchmarking machine learning algorithms*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1708.07747.
   
2. **CIFAR-10**
   - Citation: Krizhevsky, A., & Hinton, G. (2009). *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*.

This structured approach ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their respective citations for any future reference or analysis.
