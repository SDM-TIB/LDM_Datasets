To extract datasets from the research paper titled "NeurDB: An AI-powered Autonomous Data System" by Beng Chin Ooi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract, introduction, and relevant sections** of the paper, particularly focusing on any mentions of datasets or data sources. The abstract provides a high-level overview, but the introduction and subsequent sections often contain more detailed information about datasets used in the research.

Next, I will look for specific sections that typically discuss datasets, such as **"Background," "Methodology," or "Experiments."** In these sections, the authors may describe the datasets they used, including their characteristics, size, and purpose. I will pay close attention to any tables, figures, or references that might list datasets explicitly.

As I read through the paper, I will take note of any datasets mentioned, including their names and descriptions. For example, if the authors refer to datasets used for training or evaluation, I will document their names and any relevant details provided in the text.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial, as proper citation allows others to locate the original sources of the datasets. I will ensure that I capture all necessary details, such as authors, title, publication venue, and year.

If the paper mentions any datasets that are not widely known or are proprietary, I will note that as well, indicating that they may not have a formal citation but are important for the research.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset entry includes:
1. The name of the dataset.
2. A brief description of the dataset, including its purpose and key characteristics.
3. The full citation for the dataset, formatted correctly.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets referenced in the paper, providing a comprehensive overview that can be useful for future research or applications.
