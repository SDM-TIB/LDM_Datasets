To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SparQ Attention: Bandwidth-Efficient LLM Inference" by Luka Ribar et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of SparQ Attention on various downstream tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe the models and tasks used for evaluation. Here, they mention specific datasets used for question answering, summarization, language modeling, and artificial repetition tasks. 

1. **SQuAD Dataset**: This dataset is used for question answering. The authors specify that they used SQuAD v1.1, which consists of 100,000+ questions for machine comprehension of text.

2. **TriviaQA Dataset**: Another dataset used for question answering, which is a large-scale distantly supervised dataset for reading comprehension.

3. **CNN/DailyMail Dataset**: This dataset is utilized for summarization tasks, which is a well-known benchmark for evaluating summarization models.

4. **WikiText-103 Dataset**: This dataset is used for language modeling performance evaluation, providing a large corpus of text for training and testing language models.

5. **Tiny-Shakespeare Dataset**: This dataset is used for the artificial "Text Repetition" task, which involves repeating sentences from the context verbatim.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations into a structured format for further processing or review.
