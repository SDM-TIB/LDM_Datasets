To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Causal Learning for Trustworthy Recommender Systems: A Survey" by Jin Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract discusses the advancements in recommender systems (RS) and mentions the need for trustworthy systems, but it does not specify any datasets. The introduction elaborates on the challenges faced by RS but again does not mention specific datasets.

Next, I will examine the **methodology and results sections** to see if any datasets are referenced in the context of the experiments or evaluations. However, it appears that this paper is primarily a survey and may not include original experiments or datasets.

I will then look at the **tables and figures** for any references to datasets. In this paper, Table 1 summarizes trustworthiness challenges and causal solutions but does not list any datasets. 

Next, I will check the **references section** for any datasets that might be cited indirectly through the works referenced. The references include various studies that may have used datasets relevant to the topics discussed in the paper.

After reviewing the references, I will identify any datasets mentioned in the cited works. For example, if a reference discusses a dataset used in a causal learning context, I will note that down.

Finally, I will compile the information I have gathered, ensuring to include full citations for any datasets identified. If no specific datasets are mentioned in the paper or its references, I will note that as well.

In summary, my steps will include:
1. Review the abstract and introduction for dataset mentions.
2. Examine methodology and results sections for datasets.
3. Check tables and figures for dataset references.
4. Review the references section for indirect mentions of datasets.
5. Compile and cite any datasets found, ensuring to include full citations.

If no datasets are identified, I will document that the paper does not provide specific datasets for causal learning in recommender systems.
