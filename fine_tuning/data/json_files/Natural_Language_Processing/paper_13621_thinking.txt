To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Automatic Algorithm Selection for Pseudo-Boolean Optimization with Given Computational Time Limits" by Catalina Pezo et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and while it may not explicitly mention datasets, it sets the context for the research.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Designing the Machine Learning Oracle for AAAS for PBO)**, as it discusses the datasets used for training and testing the meta-solver. In **subsection 4.1**, the authors mention that the dataset of PBO instances was obtained from the **Pseudo-Boolean Competitions** held in various years (2006, 2007, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2015, and 2016). This indicates that the dataset is derived from a series of competitions, which is a crucial detail.

In **subsection 4.2**, the authors describe how the dataset was generated by running all the solvers on the collected instances. They specify that the dataset includes **3128 feasible instances** across **118 benchmarks**, which is important for understanding the dataset's scope.

Now, I will look for the full citations of the datasets mentioned. The paper references the Pseudo-Boolean Competitions, so I will need to find the appropriate citations for these competitions. The citation for the Pseudo-Boolean Competition is as follows:

- For the **Pseudo-Boolean Competitions**, the citation is:
  > Manquinho, V., Roussel, O., & Deters, M. (2011). Pseudo-Boolean Competition 2010. Retrieved from http://www.cril.univ-artois.fr/PB10.

Additionally, the authors mention various solvers used in their experiments, which may also be relevant for dataset extraction. However, the primary dataset of interest is the collection of instances from the Pseudo-Boolean Competitions.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research.
