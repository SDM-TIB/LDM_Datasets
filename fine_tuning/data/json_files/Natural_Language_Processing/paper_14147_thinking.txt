To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Cross-Modal Translation and Alignment for Survival Analysis" by Fengtao Zhou et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments on five public TCGA datasets, which indicates that these datasets are crucial for the research. The introduction will likely provide more context about these datasets and their relevance to the study.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methods** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors specifically mention using five public TCGA datasets for their experiments. I will note down the names of these datasets as they are mentioned.

In the **experiments section**, the authors list the datasets used for evaluation:
1. **Bladder Urothelial Carcinoma (BLCA)**: This dataset includes clinical and genomic data from 373 patients.
2. **Breast Invasive Carcinoma (BRCA)**: This dataset comprises data from 956 patients.
3. **Glioblastoma & Lower Grade Glioma (GBMLGG)**: This dataset contains information from 569 patients.
4. **Lung Adenocarcinoma (LUAD)**: This dataset includes data from 453 patients.
5. **Uterine Corpus Endometrial Carcinoma (UCEC)**: This dataset consists of data from 480 patients.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The TCGA datasets are publicly available, and the citation for the TCGA itself is typically included in the references. The citation for TCGA is:

> The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). *National Cancer Institute*. Available at: https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov

Since the datasets are part of the TCGA project, I will use this citation for all five datasets.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the names of the datasets along with the citation for TCGA. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for further processing or review.
