To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Using and Abusing Equivariance" by Tom Edixhoven, Attila Lengyel, and Jan C. van Gemert, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and while it may not explicitly mention datasets, it sets the context for the research. The introduction often discusses the motivation and background, which may include references to datasets used in previous work.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, as this section typically contains detailed information about the datasets used for evaluation. In this paper, the authors discuss their experiments on various datasets, which is crucial for understanding the context of their findings.

In **subsection 4.1 (Breaking Equivariance)**, the authors mention using the **ImageNet** dataset for classification tasks. They describe the dataset's significance and how it relates to their experiments. I will note down the details provided about this dataset.

Additionally, they reference the **PatchCamelyon** dataset, which is used for pathology data analysis. I will extract the relevant information about this dataset as well.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This is critical for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets.

The citations I will look for are:

1. For **ImageNet**, the citation is:
   > Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, and Li Fei-Fei. *Imagenet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In 2009 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 248–255, 2009.

2. For **PatchCamelyon**, the citation is:
   > Bastiaan S Veeling, Jasper Linmans, Jim Winkens, Taco Cohen, and Max Welling. *Rotation equivariant cnns for digital pathology*. In Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention–MICCAI 2018: 21st International Conference, Granada, Spain, September 16-20, 2018, Proceedings, Part II 11, pages 210–218. Springer, 2018.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will help in accurately documenting the datasets used in the research paper.
