To extract datasets from the research paper titled "VeLoRA: Memory Efficient Training using Rank-1 Sub-Token Projections" by Roy Miles, Pradyumna Reddy, Ismail Elezi, and Jiankang Deng, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the use of the **VTAB-1k fine-tuning benchmark** and the **C4 dataset**, which indicates that these are datasets relevant to the research.

Next, I will check the **experiments section** to gather more details about these datasets. In the introduction, the authors state that they confirm the effectiveness of their algorithm on the **VTAB-1k fine-tuning benchmark** and that they show competitive performance against other methods on the **C4 dataset**. This suggests that both datasets are crucial for evaluating their proposed method.

In the **implementation details section**, the authors specify that they performed experiments on a subset of the **VTAB-1k benchmark**, which consists of 16 different vision datasets. This indicates that VTAB-1k is a collection of datasets rather than a single dataset. I will need to note this distinction.

For the **C4 dataset**, the authors mention using it for pre-training language models, which is a significant dataset in the NLP community.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. **VTAB-1k**: The citation for the VTAB-1k benchmark is:
   > Zhai, X., Puigcerver, J., Kolesnikov, A., Ruyssen, P., Riquelme, C., Lucic, M., Djolonga, J., Pinto, A. S., Neumann, A., Dosovitskiy, A., Beyer, L., Bachem, O., Tschannen, M., Michalski, M., Gelly, S., & Houlsby, N. (2019). The visual task adaptation benchmark. CoRR, abs/1910.04867.

2. **C4 Dataset**: The citation for the C4 dataset is:
   > Raffel, C., Shazeer, N., Roberts, A., Lee, K., Narang, S., Matena, M., Zhou, W., & Liu, P. J. (2020). Exploring the limits of transfer learning with a unified text-to-text transformer. J. Mach. Learn. Res., 21, 1-67.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
