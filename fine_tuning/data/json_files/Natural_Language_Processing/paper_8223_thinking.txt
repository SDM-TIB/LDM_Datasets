To extract datasets from the research paper titled "University of Cape Town’s WMT22 System: Multilingual Machine Translation for Southern African Languages" by Khalid N. Elmadani et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and datasets sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the paper discusses a multilingual translation model for Southern African languages, which suggests that datasets are involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention that the WMT22 Shared Task provided parallel corpora for various language pairs, hinting at the existence of specific datasets. I will look for explicit names or descriptions of these datasets.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Datasets)**, where the authors describe the WMT22 dataset. They mention that it contains bitext for 248 pairs of African languages, referred to as **WMT22_african**. This dataset is used for both training and validation, with the first 3,000 sentences from each language pair reserved for validation.

Additionally, the authors state that they used the **Flores dev set** for testing, which contains 997 parallel sentences for each language pair. This is another dataset that needs to be documented.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets:

- For the **WMT22 dataset**, the citation is:
  > David Ifeoluwa Adelani, Md Mahfuz Ibn Alam, Antonios Anastasopoulos, Akshita Bhagia, Marta Costa-Jussà, Jesse Dodge, Fahim Faisal, Christian Federmann, Natalia Fedorova, Francisco Guzmán, Sergey Koshelev, Jean Maillard, Vukosi Marivate, Jonathan Mbuya, Safiyyah Saleem, and Holger Schwenk. *Findings of the WMT 2022 shared task on large-scale machine translation evaluation for African languages*. In Proceedings of the Seventh Conference on Machine Translation, Online. Association for Computational Linguistics, 2022.

- For the **Flores dev set**, the citation is:
  > No specific citation is provided in the paper for the Flores dev set, but it is commonly referenced in the context of multilingual machine translation tasks. It is advisable to refer to the original source or documentation of the Flores dataset for proper citation.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all relevant details are captured accurately for future reference.
