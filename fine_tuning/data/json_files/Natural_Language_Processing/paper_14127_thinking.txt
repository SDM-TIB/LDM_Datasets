To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Minimum-length chain embedding for the phase unwrapping problem on D-Wave’s Advantage architecture" by Mohammad Kashfi Haghighi and Nikitas Dimopoulos, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study but may not contain detailed dataset information. The introduction may mention the context or previous works that utilized specific datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as it typically contains explicit mentions of datasets used for testing or validation. In this paper, the authors mention that the datasets consist of simulated synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data, specifically noting that they include 5 synthetic images of size 10 × 10 pixels generated using a Perlin Noise Generator. This is a clear indication of a dataset being utilized.

I will also check the **references section** to find any citations related to the datasets mentioned. In this case, the authors refer to the Perlin Noise Generator, which is a well-known method for generating synthetic images. The citation for this method is:

- For the Perlin Noise Generator:
  > K. Perlin, “An image synthesizer,” ACM Siggraph Computer Graphics, vol. 19, no. 3, pp. 287–296, 1985.

Since the paper does not provide a specific citation for the synthetic images dataset itself, I will note that the dataset is derived from the Perlin Noise Generator.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the Perlin Noise Generator as it is the source of the dataset used in the experiments.

After gathering all relevant information, I will prepare the dataset entries for review or further processing, ensuring that the citations are accurate and complete.
