To extract datasets from the research paper titled "OpenEval: Benchmarking Chinese LLMs across Capability, Alignment and Safety" by Chuang Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract states that OpenEval includes **12 benchmark datasets for capability assessment**, **7 datasets for alignment assessment**, and **6 datasets for safety evaluation**. This indicates that multiple datasets are involved, and I need to find their specific names and details.

Next, I will focus on the **evaluation taxonomy** section, particularly **section 4**, where the authors describe the datasets used for capability, alignment, and safety evaluations. I will look for subsections that list these datasets explicitly.

In **section 4.1 (Capability)**, the paper mentions several datasets:
1. **BiPaR**: A bilingual parallel dataset for multilingual and cross-lingual reading comprehension.
   - Citation: Jing, Y., Liu, C., et al. (2019). *BiPaR: A bilingual parallel dataset for multilingual and cross-lingual reading comprehension on novels*. In Proceedings of the 2019 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP).

2. **C3**: A free-form multiple-choice Chinese machine reading comprehension dataset.
   - Citation: Sun, C., et al. (2020). *C3: A free-form multiple-choice Chinese machine reading comprehension dataset*. In Proceedings of the 2020 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP).

3. **ChineseSquad**: A dataset converted from the SQuAD reading comprehension dataset.

7. **WPLC**: A dataset for evaluating word prediction in long contexts.
   - Citation: Ge, H. et al. (2021). *Chinese WPLC: A Chinese dataset for evaluating pretrained language models on word prediction given long-range context*. In Proceedings of the 2021 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP).

8. **M3KE**: A benchmark for knowledge competency in Chinese language.

In **section 4.3 (Safety)**, the paper mentions:
1. **TUMCC**: A dataset for code word recognition.
   - Citation: Hou, Y. et al. (2022). *TUMCC: A Chinese corpus in the field of code word recognition*. Information Processing & Management, 59(5):103033.

2. **Power-seeking**: A dataset assessing power-seeking behavior in LLMs.
   - Citation: Perez, E. et al. (2023). *Discovering language model behaviors with model-written evaluations*. In Findings of the Association for Computational Linguistics: ACL 2023.

   - Citation: Kinniment, M. et al. (2023). *Evaluating language-model agents on realistic autonomous tasks*. CoRR, abs/2312.11671.

After gathering all the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
