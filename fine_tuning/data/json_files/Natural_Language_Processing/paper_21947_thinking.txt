To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SRAGAN: Saliency Regularized and Attended Generative Adversarial Network for Chinese Ink-wash Painting Generation" by Xiang Gao and Yuqi Zhang, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's focus, but the details about datasets are likely to be found in the experiments section.

In the **experiments section (Section 4)**, the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. They mention three specific tasks related to generating Chinese ink-wash paintings and provide details about the datasets for each task:

1. **RealLandscape**: This is the source-domain dataset for landscape painting generation. The authors do not provide specific details about the number of images or the source of this dataset in the text, so I will need to check the references for any citations related to this dataset.

2. **InkLandscape**: This is the target-domain dataset for landscape painting generation. Similar to RealLandscape, specific details are not provided, so I will also look for citations in the references.

3. **RealHorses**: This dataset is described as containing 900 images of horses, which were screened and supplemented from a previous dataset. The authors mention that they removed abnormal images to enhance the dataset's quality.

4. **InkHorses**: This target-domain dataset contains 500 Chinese ink-wash paintings of horses. The authors also mention that this dataset was screened and supplemented.

5. **RealBirds**: This dataset consists of 900 real bird images collected by the authors, including various species. 

6. **InkBirds**: This target-domain dataset contains 500 Chinese ink-wash paintings of birds, also collected by the authors.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. The citations may not be explicitly listed for all datasets, especially those created by the authors themselves, but I will look for any relevant papers that might have contributed to the datasets mentioned.

After gathering the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset where applicable. If the authors created the datasets themselves, I will note that in the description.

Finally, I will summarize the findings in a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset, its purpose, and its citation, ready for further processing or review.
