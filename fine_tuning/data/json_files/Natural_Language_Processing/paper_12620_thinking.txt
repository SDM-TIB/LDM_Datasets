To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MetaGPT: Meta Programming for a Multi-Agent Collaborative Framework" by Sirui Hong et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors validate their design using publicly available benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for evaluation. In **section 4.1 (Experimental Setting)**, they list three datasets:

1. **HumanEval**: This dataset includes 164 handwritten programming tasks, which consist of function specifications, descriptions, reference codes, and tests.

2. **MBPP**: This dataset consists of 427 Python tasks that cover core concepts and standard library features, including descriptions, reference codes, and automated tests.

3. **SoftwareDev**: This is a self-generated dataset containing 70 representative examples of software development tasks, each with its own task prompt.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **HumanEval**, the citation is:
  > Chen, M., Tworek, M., Jun, H., Yuan, Q., Ponde de Oliveira Pinto, H., Kaplan, J., ... & Zaremba, W. (2021). *Evaluating large language models trained on code*. In Proceedings of the 2021 Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS).

- For **MBPP**, the citation is:
  > Austin, J., Odena, J., Nye, M., Bosma, A., Michalewski, H., Dohan, D., ... & Sutton, C. (2021). *Program synthesis with large language models*. In Proceedings of the 2021 Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS).

- For **SoftwareDev**, since it is a self-generated dataset, I will note that it does not have a formal citation but will describe it as a collection of 70 diverse software development tasks.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for HumanEval and MBPP, while noting the nature of the SoftwareDev dataset.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its citation and description.
