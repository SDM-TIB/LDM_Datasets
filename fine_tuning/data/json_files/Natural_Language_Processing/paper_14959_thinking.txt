To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Time integration schemes based on neural networks for solving partial differential equations on coarse grids" by Xinxin Yan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract discusses the application of learned time integration schemes to solve three model PDEs: the one-dimensional heat equation, the one-dimensional wave equation, and the one-dimensional Burgersâ€™ equation. This indicates that datasets related to these equations may be present.

Next, I will look for specific sections that detail the datasets used. The **experiments section** is likely to contain information about the datasets employed for training and testing the models. I will pay particular attention to any subsections that mention datasets or data preparation.

In the **results section**, the authors describe the performance of their models on the aforementioned PDEs. They mention using numerical solutions generated from fine grids to create training data for the neural networks. This suggests that the datasets are derived from numerical simulations rather than publicly available datasets.

I will also check the **appendices** for any additional details regarding the datasets, such as specific configurations, parameters used in simulations, or any supplementary data that may have been generated during the experiments.

Now, I will compile the information I find into a structured format, ensuring to include full citations for any datasets or references to previous works that describe the datasets used. 

For example, if the authors refer to datasets generated from previous studies or specific numerical methods, I will include those citations. If they mention specific configurations or parameters for the PDEs, I will document those as well.

Finally, I will summarize the findings, ensuring that each dataset is clearly identified, along with its context and any relevant citations, to provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research.
