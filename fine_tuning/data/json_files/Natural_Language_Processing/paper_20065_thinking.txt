To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Motion-Guided Dual-Camera Tracker for Low-Cost Skill Evaluation of Gastric Endoscopy" by Yuelin Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the proposed tracker was evaluated on datasets captured during endoscopy procedures, which suggests that there are specific datasets involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experiments and Results)**, where the authors describe their experimental setup. Here, they mention that a dataset with **14,530 images** of the endoscope at different postures was collected. This dataset is divided into training and testing sets, with **10,270 images for training** and **4,260 images for testing**. The authors also note that the bounding boxes of the endoscope tip were annotated as 2D ground truth.

In this section, I will also look for any additional details about the dataset, such as how it was collected and any specific characteristics that may be relevant for citation.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. Since the dataset is self-collected by the authors, it may not have a formal citation like other datasets. However, I will still document it as follows:

- **Endoscope Dataset**: This dataset consists of 14,530 images collected from a dual-camera setup during endoscopy procedures in a mechanical gastric simulator. The dataset is divided into training (10,270 images) and testing (4,260 images) sets, with annotations for the endoscope tip's bounding boxes.

Since this dataset is self-collected, I will note that it is available through the authors' GitHub repository, which is mentioned in the paper.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and any relevant links or citations. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.
