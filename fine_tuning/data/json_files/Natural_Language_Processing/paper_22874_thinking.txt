To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Large language models for sentiment analysis of newspaper articles during COVID-19: The Guardian" by Rohitash Chandra et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the use of sentiment analysis on articles from The Guardian, which suggests that there may be specific datasets involved.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly **section 3 (Methodology)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their analysis. Here, they explicitly mention two datasets:

1. **SenWave Dataset**: This dataset aggregates over 105 million tweets and Weibo messages related to COVID-19 in multiple languages, with a specific focus on 10,000 English tweets that have been tagged across various sentiment categories. The authors provide a link to the dataset, which is crucial for citation.

2. **The Guardian Newspaper Dataset**: This dataset consists of approximately 150,000 news articles from The Guardian, covering the period from 2016 to 2023. The authors detail how they partitioned this dataset into pre-pandemic and pandemic periods, which is important for understanding the context of their analysis.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are essential for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For the **SenWave Dataset**, the citation is:
> Yang, Q., Alamro, H., Albaradei, S., Salhi, A., Lv, X., Ma, C., ... & Duarte, C. M. (2020). SenWave: Monitoring the global sentiments under the COVID-19 pandemic. arXiv:2006.10842.

For **The Guardian Newspaper Dataset**, the citation is:
> Kharosekar, A. (2022). Guardian news articles. Kaggle. Retrieved from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adityakharosekar2/guardian-news-articles.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This will ensure that the datasets are accurately represented and easily accessible for future research or analysis.
