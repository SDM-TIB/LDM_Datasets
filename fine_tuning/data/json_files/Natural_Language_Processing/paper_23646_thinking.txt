To extract datasets from the research paper titled "LogiCode: an LLM-Driven Framework for Logical Anomaly Detection" by Yiheng Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions a custom dataset called **"LOCO-Annotations"** and a benchmark named **"LogiBench"**. This indicates that these are the primary datasets introduced in the paper.

Next, I will look for specific sections that detail these datasets. The **introduction** provides context for the datasets, emphasizing their role in evaluating the LogiCode framework. It mentions that the LOCO-Annotations dataset is designed to analyze logical anomaly detection and is publicly available at a specified GitHub link.

I will then examine **section IV (Evaluations and Discussions)**, where the LOCO-Annotations dataset is described in detail. The authors explain that this dataset consists of 2,908 annotated images, with a breakdown of 1,772 training images and 1,136 testing images. It categorizes logical anomalies into four types: Quantity Anomalies, Size Anomalies, Position Anomalies, and Matching Anomalies. Each image is accompanied by JSON files that provide pixel-level object segmentation and ground truth annotations.

Additionally, I will look for the **LogiBench** benchmark in the same section, which is mentioned as a tool for evaluating the LogiCode framework. However, it seems that the paper does not provide a detailed description or citation for LogiBench, as it primarily focuses on the LOCO-Annotations dataset.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the LOCO-Annotations dataset. The paper references the original MVTec LOCO dataset, which is crucial for understanding the context of the LOCO-Annotations dataset. The citation for the MVTec LOCO dataset is:

- For **MVTec LOCO Dataset**:
  > P. Bergmann, K. Batzner, M. Fauser, D. Sattlegger, and C. Steger. *Beyond dents and scratches: Logical constraints in unsupervised anomaly detection and localization*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 130(4):947â€“969, 2022.

Since the LOCO-Annotations dataset is an extension of the MVTec LOCO dataset, I will use this citation to represent it, while also noting that the LOCO-Annotations dataset is publicly available at the provided GitHub link.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citation for the MVTec LOCO dataset as the authoritative reference for the LOCO-Annotations dataset. 

This structured approach will ensure that I accurately extract and cite the datasets mentioned in the paper.
