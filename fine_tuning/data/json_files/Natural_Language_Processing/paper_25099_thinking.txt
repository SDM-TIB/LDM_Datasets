To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning treatment effects while treating those in need" by Bryan Wilder and Pim Welle, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors applied their framework to data from human services in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, which suggests that there are specific datasets used in their analysis.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology and results sections** where the authors describe their empirical study. In the results section, they mention using data from two human service settings in Allegheny County, specifically:

1. **Public Housing Assistance Dataset**: This dataset includes 9,213 individuals who were eligible for public housing assistance. The authors use this dataset to train a random forest classifier to predict the probability of having at least four emergency department visits in the next year.

2. **Jail Reentry Dataset**: This dataset contains outcomes for 76,052 incarcerated individuals released from jail. The authors predict the status-quo reentry risk using a random forest classifier and set the utility function based on this predicted risk.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. However, since the datasets are derived from administrative data collected by the Allegheny County Department of Human Services, they may not have formal citations like published datasets. Instead, I will note the source as the Allegheny County Department of Human Services.

The citations for the datasets will be as follows:

- For the **Public Housing Assistance Dataset**:
  > Allegheny County Department of Human Services. *Public Housing Assistance Dataset*. Unpublished data.

- For the **Jail Reentry Dataset**:
  > Allegheny County Department of Human Services. *Jail Reentry Dataset*. Unpublished data.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that clearly identifies each dataset along with its source. This will ensure that the datasets are properly documented for future reference or analysis.
