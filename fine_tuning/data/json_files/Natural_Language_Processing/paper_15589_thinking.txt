To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Non-Compositionality in Sentiment: New Data and Analyses" by Verna Dankers and Christopher G. Lucas, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors created a resource of ratings for 259 phrases, referred to as **NONCOMPSST**, which suggests that this is a dataset of interest.

Next, I will look closely at **section 3 (Collecting non-compositionality ratings)**, where the authors describe their methodology for obtaining non-compositionality ratings. They mention using phrases from the **Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST)**, which is a well-known dataset in sentiment analysis. This section provides details on how they selected phrases from the SST for their study.

In **section 3.1 (Materials)**, the authors provide further details about the SST dataset, stating that it contains 11,855 English sentences from movie reviews, annotated with sentiment labels. This confirms that the SST dataset is a key component of their research.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST). The citation is as follows:
- For the **Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST)**, the citation is:
  > Richard Socher, Alex Perelygin, Jean Wu, Jason Chuang, Christopher D Manning, Andrew Y Ng, and Christopher Potts. *Recursive deep models for semantic compositionality over a sentiment treebank*. In Proceedings of the 2013 conference on empirical methods in natural language processing, pages 1631â€“1642, 2013.

Additionally, I will document the newly created dataset **NONCOMPSST**. While the paper does not provide a formal citation for this dataset, I can describe it based on the information provided in the paper. It consists of non-compositionality ratings for 259 phrases, which were derived from the SST dataset.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the necessary details and citations for each dataset identified. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets utilized in the research.
