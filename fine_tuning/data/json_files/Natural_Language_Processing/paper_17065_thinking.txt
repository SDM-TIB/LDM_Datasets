To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Semantic Complete Scene Forecasting from a 4D Dynamic Point Cloud Sequence" by Zifan Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on various benchmarks, including two large-scale indoor benchmarks they contributed. This suggests that there are specific datasets that need to be identified.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used in their work. Here, they mention two indoor datasets they contributed: **IGPLAY** and **IGNAV**, as well as the outdoor dataset **SemanticKITTI**. I will take note of the details provided for each dataset, including their characteristics and the context in which they were used.

1. **IGPLAY Dataset**: The authors describe IGPLAY as containing 1,000 scenes lasting 10 timesteps each, where a viewer interacts with various toys among furniture. It includes 10 semantic classes and is designed for 4D dynamic scene completion and forecasting.

2. **IGNAV Dataset**: This dataset consists of 600 scenes lasting 10 timesteps each, featuring multiple robots navigating the scene. It includes 9 semantic classes and aims to provide a new perspective on scene dynamics.

3. **SemanticKITTI Dataset**: The authors mention SemanticKITTI as a well-known outdoor dataset collected by autonomous cars, suitable for evaluating their SCSF task.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

- For **IGPLAY and IGNAV**, the authors do not provide a specific citation in the references, but they mention that these datasets were generated using the Interactive Gibson Simulator (iGibson). Therefore, I will cite the iGibson paper:
  > Xia, F., Shen, W. B., Li, C., Kasimbeg, P., Tchapmi, M. E., Toshev, A., Martín-Martín, R., & Savarese, S. (2020). Interactive Gibson Benchmark: A Benchmark for Interactive Navigation in Cluttered Environments. IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters, 5(2), 713–720.

- For **SemanticKITTI**, the citation is:
  > Behley, J., Garbade, M., Milioto, A., Quenzel, J., Behnke, S., Stachniss, C., & Gall, J. (2019). SemanticKITTI: A Dataset for Semantic Scene Understanding of LiDAR Sequences. In Proc. of the IEEE/CVF International Conf. on Computer Vision (ICCV).

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
