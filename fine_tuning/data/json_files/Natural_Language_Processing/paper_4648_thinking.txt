To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "AEDA: An Easier Data Augmentation Technique for Text Classification" by Akbar Karimi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors performed experiments on five different datasets for text classification, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention five datasets:

1. **SST-2 (Stanford Sentiment Treebank)**: This dataset is referenced as being used for sentiment analysis.
2. **CR (Customer Reviews Dataset)**: This dataset is used for analyzing customer reviews.
3. **SUBJ (Subjectivity/Objectivity Dataset)**: This dataset is utilized for determining the subjectivity or objectivity of text.
4. **TREC (Question Classification Dataset)**: This dataset is employed for classifying questions.
5. **PC (Pros and Cons Dataset)**: This dataset is used for analyzing pros and cons in text.

In this section, the authors also provide citations for the datasets, which I will need to note down for full citations.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to retrieve the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

- For **SST-2**, the citation is:
  > Richard Socher, John Bauer, Christopher D. Manning, and Andrew Y Ng. *Parsing with compositional vector grammars*. In Proceedings of the 51st Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL-04), pages 455–465, 2013.

- For **CR**, the citation is:
  > Minqing Hu and Bing Liu. *Mining and summarizing customer reviews*. In Proceedings of the tenth ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining, pages 168–177, 2004.

- For **SUBJ**, the citation is:
  > Bo Pang and Lillian Lee. *A sentimental education: Sentiment analysis using subjectivity summarization based on minimum cuts*. In Proceedings of the 42nd Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL-04), pages 271–278, 2004.

- For **TREC**, the citation is:
  > Xin Li and Dan Roth. *Learning question classifiers*. In COLING 2002: The 19th International Conference on Computational Linguistics, 2002.

- For **PC**, the citation is:
  > Murthy Ganapathibhotla and Bing Liu. *Mining opinions in comparative sentences*. In Proceedings of the 22nd International Conference on Computational Linguistics (Coling 2008), pages 241–248, 2008.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
