To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Lossless Acceleration of Large Language Model via Adaptive N-gram Parallel Decoding" by Jie Ou et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on various models and datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper. The introduction may provide additional context about the datasets used in their experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4), particularly **subsection 4.2 (Datasets & Metrics)**. This subsection is likely to contain explicit mentions of the datasets utilized in their experiments. Here, I will look for any dataset names, descriptions, and the context in which they were used (e.g., tasks like text summarization or code generation).

In this paper, the authors mention three datasets:

1. **CNN/Daily Mail (CNN/DM)**: This dataset is used for text summarization tasks. I will note its significance in the context of the experiments.

2. **Extreme Summarization (XSum)**: Another dataset mentioned for summarization tasks, which I will also include in my notes.

3. **HumanEval**: This dataset is used for code generation tasks, and I will ensure to capture its relevance as well.

After identifying these datasets, I will then refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets themselves.

The citations I will extract are:

- For **CNN/Daily Mail**:
  > Karl Moritz Hermann, Tomás Kociský, Edward Grefenstette, Lasse Espeholt, Will Kay, Mustafa Suleyman, and Phil Blunsom. *Teaching machines to read and comprehend*. In NIPS, pages 1693–1701, 2015.

- For **Extreme Summarization (XSum)**:
  > Shashi Narayan, Shay B. Cohen, and Mirella Lapata. *Don’t give me the details, just the summary! topic-aware convolutional neural networks for extreme summarization*. ArXiv, abs/1808.08745, 2018.

- For **HumanEval**:
  > Mark Chen, Jerry Tworek, Heewoo Jun, Qiming Yuan, Henrique Ponde de Oliveira Pinto, Jared Kaplan, Harri Edwards, Yuri Burda, Nicholas Joseph, Greg Brockman, Alex Ray, Raul Puri, Gretchen Krueger, Michael Petrov, Heidy Khlaaf, Girish Sastry, Pamela Mishkin, Brooke Chan, Scott Gray, Nick Ryder, Mikhail Pavlov, Alethea Power, Lukasz Kaiser, Mohammad Bavarian, Clemens Winter, Philippe Tillet, Felipe Petroski Such, Dave Cummings, Matthias Plappert, Fotios Chantzis, Elizabeth Barnes, Ariel Herbert-Voss, William Hebgen Guss, Alex Nichol, Alex Paino, Nikolas Tezak, Jie Tang, Igor Babuschkin, Suchir Balaji, Shantanu Jain, William Saunders, Christopher Hesse, Andrew N.

With these citations in hand, I will compile the dataset information, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
