To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ON VARIABLE ANNUITIES WITH SURRENDER CHARGES" by Tiziano De Angelis, Alessandro Milazzo, and Gabriele Stabile, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or numerical experiments.

Next, I will examine the **experiments or numerical analysis sections** to see if the authors describe any datasets used for their analysis. This is often where datasets are detailed, including their sources, sizes, and specific characteristics.

In this paper, the authors discuss a theoretical analysis and numerical experiments related to variable annuities. They mention using a **Gompertz-Makeham mortality model** for their numerical analysis, which suggests that they may have used specific datasets related to mortality rates or financial data.

I will also check the **references section** for any cited datasets or related works that may provide datasets. If the authors refer to existing datasets, I will note those references for full citations.

If the paper includes any tables or figures that summarize data, I will extract the relevant information from those as well. This may include numerical results or parameters used in their models.

Once I have identified the datasets, I will ensure to write down the full citations for each dataset as follows:

1. **Gompertz-Makeham mortality model**: The citation for the parameters used in this model is:
   > A. Horiuchi and A. J. Coale. *Age patterns of mortality for older women: An analysis using the age-specific rate of mortality change with age*. Mathematical Population Studies, 2(4):245â€“267, 1990.

2. If any other datasets are mentioned, I will follow the same process to find their citations.

Finally, I will compile all the identified datasets along with their full citations into a structured format for easy reference. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their sources.
