To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multimodal Identification of Alzheimer’s Disease: A Review" by Guian Fang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

1. **Read the Abstract and Introduction**: I will start by examining the abstract and introduction sections for any mentions of datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on multimodal approaches for diagnosing Alzheimer's disease, which may hint at specific datasets used.

2. **Identify Sections on Data and Methods**: Next, I will look for sections that explicitly discuss datasets, such as "Datasets," "Methods," or "Experiments." These sections typically contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the study.

3. **Locate Specific Datasets**: In the paper, I will look for any named datasets. For example, the authors might mention well-known datasets like the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) or other specific datasets related to imaging, cognitive assessments, or biomarkers.

4. **Extract Dataset Details**: For each identified dataset, I will note down key details such as:
   - The name of the dataset
   - The number of subjects or samples included
   - The types of data collected (e.g., imaging, cognitive scores, biomarkers)
   - Any specific tasks or assessments associated with the dataset

5. **Check the References Section**: After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the references section of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for the datasets used in the research.

6. **Compile the Information**: I will compile the extracted information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset entry includes:
   - The dataset name
   - A brief description of the dataset
   - The full citation for the dataset as found in the references section

7. **Review for Completeness**: Finally, I will review the extracted information to ensure that all relevant datasets have been captured and that the citations are accurate and complete.

By following these steps, I will ensure a thorough extraction of datasets from the research paper, along with their proper citations.
