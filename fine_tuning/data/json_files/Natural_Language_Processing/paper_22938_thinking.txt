To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Precision Healthcare: Robust Fusion of Time Series and Image Data" by Ali Rasekh et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors tested their method using the **MIMIC dataset**, which suggests that this dataset is significant for their research.

Next, I will focus on **section III (Multimodal Data Preparation)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used. Here, they mention two specific datasets:

1. **MIMIC-IV**: This dataset is described as a large, freely available database containing healthcare data from patients admitted between 2008 and 2019. It includes comprehensive information such as patient demographics, diagnoses, procedures, medications, and laboratory measurements.

2. **MIMIC-CXR**: This is a subset of the MIMIC dataset that focuses specifically on chest X-ray images. It contains 377,110 de-identified chest radiographs, making it a valuable resource for medical image analysis.

In the **experiments section**, the authors confirm that they utilized both the **MIMIC-IV** and **MIMIC-CXR** datasets for their experiments, which reinforces their importance in the study.

Now, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for these datasets:

- For **MIMIC-IV**, the citation is:
  > Alistair EW Johnson, Lucas Bulgarelli, Lu Shen, Alvin Gayles, Ayad Shammout, Steven Horng, Tom J Pollard, Sicheng Hao, Benjamin Moody, Brian Gow, et al. *MIMIC-IV, a freely accessible electronic health record dataset*. Scientific data, 10(1):1, 2023.

- For **MIMIC-CXR**, the citation is:
  > Alistair EW Johnson, Tom J Pollard, Nathaniel R Greenbaum, Matthew P Lungren, Chih-ying Deng, Yifan Peng, Zhiyong Lu, Roger G Mark, Seth J Berkowitz, and Steven Horng. *MIMIC-CXR-JPG, a large publicly available database of labeled chest radiographs*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1901.07042, 2019.

With this information, I can now compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
