To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Zero-Shot 3D Shape Correspondence" by Ahmed Abdelreheem et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention any datasets used. In this case, the authors introduce a new dataset for strongly non-isometric shape matching, referred to as the **Strongly Non-Isometric Shapes Dataset (SNIS)**.

Next, I will look into the **methodology and experiments sections** to gather more details about the datasets. In section 4.1, the authors describe the SNIS dataset in detail, including its composition and purpose. They mention that the dataset includes 250 shape pairs annotated with keypoint correspondences and dense segmentation maps. This section confirms the dataset's significance in their experiments.

I will also check the **related work section** to see if any other datasets are referenced. The authors mention existing datasets like **FAUST** and **SMAL**, which are used as sources for creating the SNIS dataset. This indicates that these datasets are relevant to the research.

Now, I will compile the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. I will refer to the **References section** for accurate citations:

1. **Strongly Non-Isometric Shapes Dataset (SNIS)**: This dataset is introduced by the authors themselves, so I will create a citation based on the paper:

2. **FAUST Dataset**: The citation for this dataset is:

3. **SMAL Dataset**: The citation for this dataset is:

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets and their citations in a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly identified along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
