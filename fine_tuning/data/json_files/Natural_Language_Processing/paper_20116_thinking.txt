To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Learning Approaches for Human Action Recognition in Video Data" by Yufei Xie, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental results sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the use of a subset of the **UCF101 Videos dataset**, which indicates that this dataset is central to the research.

Next, I will examine the **methodology section**, where the author explicitly states that the study utilizes the **UCF101 Videos dataset** for conducting experiments with various deep learning models. This section provides additional context about the dataset, including its size and the number of action categories it contains.

In the **data preprocessing techniques subsection**, the author describes the dataset in more detail, confirming that it comprises over 13,000 clips across 101 action categories. This reinforces the importance of the UCF101 dataset in the study.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the UCF101 dataset. However, the paper does not provide a direct citation for the dataset itself. I will need to refer to the original source of the UCF101 dataset, which is typically cited as follows:

- For the **UCF101 Videos dataset**, the citation is:
  > Soomro, K., Zamir, A. R., & Shah, M. (2012). *UCF101: A dataset of 101 human actions classes from videos in the wild*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1212.0402.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets, I will conclude that the only dataset extracted from this research paper is the UCF101 Videos dataset.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry with the full citation into a structured format for clarity and future reference.
