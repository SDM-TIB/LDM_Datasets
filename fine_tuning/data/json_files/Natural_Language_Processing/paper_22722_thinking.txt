To extract datasets from the research paper titled "FAME-MT Dataset: Formality Awareness Made Easy for Machine Translation Purposes" by Dawid Wiśniewski et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are introduced or referenced. The abstract mentions the FAME-MT dataset, which consists of 11.2 million translations between 15 European source languages and 8 European target languages, classified into formal and informal categories. This indicates that the dataset is central to the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** (in this case, section 3) to find detailed descriptions of the FAME-MT dataset. Here, the authors describe the dataset creation process, including the selection of source and target languages, the classification of translations, and the overall structure of the dataset. They mention that the dataset includes 100,000 annotated translation examples for each of the 112 language pairs considered.

In the **experiments** section, I will check if the authors discuss the application of the FAME-MT dataset in their experiments, which they do. They describe how the dataset was used to fine-tune machine translation models, confirming its practical relevance.

Now, I will gather the full citation for the FAME-MT dataset. The authors provide a link to the dataset in the paper, which is crucial for proper citation. The citation for the dataset is as follows:

> Wiśniewski, Dawid, Zofia Rostek, and Artur Nowakowski. *FAME-MT Dataset: Formality Awareness Made Easy for Machine Translation Purposes*. Available at: https://github.com/laniqo-public/fame-mt/

Additionally, I will check the **References section** for any other datasets mentioned in relation to formality classification, such as GYAFC and CoCoA-MT, which are referenced as comparisons to the FAME-MT dataset. Their citations are:

- For GYAFC:
  > Rao, Sudha, and Joel R. Tetreault. 2018. "Dear sir or madam, may I introduce the GYAFC dataset: Corpus, benchmarks and metrics for formality style transfer." In Proceedings of the 2018 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, pages 129–140. Association for Computational Linguistics.

- For CoCoA-MT:
  > Nadejde, Maria, Anna Currey, Benjamin Hsu, Xing Niu, Marcello Federico, and Georgiana Dinu. 2022. "Cocoa-mt: A dataset and benchmark for contrastive controlled MT with application to formality." In Findings of the Association for Computational Linguistics: NAACL 2022, pages 616–632. Association for Computational Linguistics.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and cited according to the standards required for academic work. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets discussed in the paper.
