To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Evaluating the Vulnerabilities in ML systems in terms of adversarial attacks" by John Harshith et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses adversarial attacks but does not specify any datasets. The introduction provides context about machine learning vulnerabilities but does not mention specific datasets either.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental results section**. Here, the authors mention evaluating adversarial example generation methods on a subset of **ImageNet images**. This indicates that the ImageNet dataset is used in their experiments.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citation for the ImageNet dataset. The relevant citation is:

- **ImageNet**: 
  > Olga Russakovsky, Jia Deng, Hao Sheng, et al. *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 115(3):211-252, 2015.

Since the paper primarily discusses adversarial attacks and does not introduce any new datasets, the only dataset I need to extract is ImageNet.

Now, I will compile the dataset entry for ImageNet, ensuring to include the full citation as required. This will be ready for downstream processing or review.
