To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SceNeRFlow: Time-Consistent Reconstruction of General Dynamic Scenes" by Edith Tretschk et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for evaluation. The introduction often elaborates on the context of the research and may reference datasets that are critical to the experiments.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, there is a section labeled **4. Experiments**, which typically includes details about the datasets used for training and evaluation. I will pay close attention to any descriptions of the datasets, including their names, purposes, and characteristics.

In the **experiments section**, I will find a table (Table 3) that describes the datasets used in the study. The datasets mentioned are:

1. **Seq. 1**: Two people playing with a plush dog, 125 frames.
2. **Seq. 2**: Two people holding hands, 125 frames.
3. **Seq. 3**: One person rotating, one person walking, 300 frames.
4. **Seq. 4**: A person dancing while wearing a dark dress, 100 frames.
5. **Seq. 5**: A person walking like a zombie while wearing a light dress, 125 frames.
6. **Seq. 6**: A person playing with a plush dog, 125 frames.
7. **Seq. 7**: A person standing with a brown dress, 125 frames.
8. **Seq. 8**: A person doing squats (from NR-NeRF), 5 frames.

Next, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets that are derived from other works. In this case, Seq. 8 is noted to be from NR-NeRF, so I will need to locate the citation for that paper.

The citation for NR-NeRF is:
> Edgar Tretschk, Ayush Tewari, Vladislav Golyanik, Michael Zollh√∂fer, Christoph Lassner, and Christian Theobalt. *Non-rigid neural radiance fields: Reconstruction and novel view synthesis of a dynamic scene from monocular video*. In International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2021.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their descriptions, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citations for any datasets referenced from other works.

Finally, I will summarize the findings, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its citation, ready for further processing or review.
