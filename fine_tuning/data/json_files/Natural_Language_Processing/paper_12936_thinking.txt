To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Semantics2Hands: Transferring Hand Motion Semantics between Avatars" by Zijie Ye et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors trained their model using the **Mixamo** and **InterHand2.6M** datasets, which suggests that these are the primary datasets of interest.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (specifically section 5) where the authors provide details about the datasets used. In this section, they explicitly mention:

1. **Mixamo Dataset**: This dataset consists of animations performed by various virtual characters with different shapes. However, it is noted that the dataset does not guarantee consistent hand motion quality and diversity.

2. **InterHand2.6M Dataset**: This dataset is described as a comprehensive collection of hand motion data captured using a multi-view camera system, supplemented with MANO hand pose annotations. It offers high-quality hand motion data with considerable diversity.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Mixamo Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Adobe. 2018. *Mixamo*. https://www.mixamo.com/.

- For the **InterHand2.6M Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Gyeongsik Moon, Shoou-I Yu, He Wen, Takaaki Shiratori, and Kyoung Mu Lee. 2020. *InterHand2.6M: A Dataset and Baseline for 3D Interacting Hand Pose Estimation from a Single RGB Image*. In European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV).

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets in a clear format, ensuring that I include the full citations as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research, which is crucial for reproducibility and further research in the field.
