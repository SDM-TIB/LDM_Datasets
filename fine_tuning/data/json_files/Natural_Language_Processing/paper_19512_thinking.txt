To extract datasets from the research paper titled "HSONet: A Siamese foreground association-driven hard case sample optimization network for high-resolution remote sensing image change detection" by Chao Tao et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that experiments were conducted on four public datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any relevant sections that discuss the datasets used in the experiments. In this paper, the datasets are mentioned in the **Experiments and Discussion** section, specifically under the **Datasets** subsection.

The paper lists four datasets used for evaluation:

1. **LEVIR-CD**: This dataset consists of 637 pairs of Google Earth images, each with a size of 1024×1024 pixels and a resolution of 0.5 m, spanning from 2002 to 2018. It contains various building change information.

2. **Google-CD**: This dataset records changes in various types of buildings in the suburbs of Guangzhou, China, from 2006 to 2019. It includes 19 pairs of images sourced from Google Earth, with spatial resolutions of 0.55 m and varying image sizes.

3. **CDD**: This dataset contains 11 pairs of multisource remote sensing images collected in different seasons, with resolutions varying from 0.03 m to 1 m. It focuses on accurately detecting changes in buildings, roads, farmland, and vehicles.

4. **SYSU-CD**: This dataset includes 20,000 pairs of aerial images collected in Hong Kong, China, from 2007 to 2014. All images are 256×256 pixels with a resolution of 0.5 m, covering various types of changes.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- **LEVIR-CD**: 
  > Chen, H., & Shi, Z. (2020). A spatial-temporal attention-based method and a new dataset for remote sensing image change detection. *Remote Sensing*, 12(10), 1662.

- **Google-CD**:

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
