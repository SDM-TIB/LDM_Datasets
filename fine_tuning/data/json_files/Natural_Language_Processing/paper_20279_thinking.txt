To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Bugs in Large Language Models Generated Code: An Empirical Study" by Florian Tambon et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study examines a sample of 333 bugs collected from code generated using three leading LLMs, which suggests that there is a dataset involved.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly the part where the authors describe their data collection process. Here, they mention using a benchmark dataset called **CoderEval**, which consists of 230 Python functions from 43 open-source projects and 230 Java functions from 10 open-source projects selected from GitHub. This is a clear indication of a dataset being utilized in their study.

In the **results section**, the authors discuss the bugs identified in the code generated by the LLMs, but they do not introduce any new datasets. Instead, they analyze the bugs found in the code generated from the previously mentioned **CoderEval** dataset.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the **CoderEval** dataset. The citation for CoderEval is as follows:
> Yu, H., Shen, B., Ran, D., Zhang, Q., Zhang, Y., Ma, G., Li, Y., Xie, T., & Wang, Q. (2023). *Codereval: A benchmark of pragmatic code generation with generative pre-trained models*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2302.00288.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets, I will conclude that **CoderEval** is the primary dataset used in this study.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry for **CoderEval** using the required format, ensuring that the citation is included correctly. This structured approach will help ensure that I have accurately captured the relevant datasets and their citations from the research paper.
