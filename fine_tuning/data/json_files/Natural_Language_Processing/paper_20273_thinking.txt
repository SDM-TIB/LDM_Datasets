To extract datasets from the research paper titled "LocalMamba: Visual State Space Model with Windowed Selective Scan" by Tao Huang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for evaluation. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets, while the methodology and experiments sections typically detail the datasets used for training and testing the models.

In the **introduction**, I will look for any references to datasets that the authors might have used or compared against. If the authors mention specific datasets, I will note their names and any relevant details provided.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as this is where the authors usually describe the datasets in detail. I will look for subsections that explicitly mention datasets, such as "Datasets" or "Experimental Setup." Here, I will extract the names of the datasets, their descriptions, and any specific characteristics mentioned, such as the number of samples, types of annotations, or any splits used for training and testing.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily. I will ensure to note the authors, title, publication venue, and year for each dataset.

For example, if the paper mentions using the **ImageNet dataset**, I would look for its citation in the references, which might look something like this:
> Deng, J., Dong, W., Socher, R., Li, L.J., Li, K., Fei-Fei, L. "ImageNet: A large-scale hierarchical image database." In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 248â€“255, 2009.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, including their names, descriptions, and citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference.

In summary, my step-by-step approach will be:
1. Read the abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections for mentions of datasets.
2. Identify and note the names and descriptions of datasets in the experiments section.
3. Check the references for full citations of each dataset.
4. Compile the dataset information for clarity and future reference.
