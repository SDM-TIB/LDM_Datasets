To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Word Embedding Based New Corpus for Low-Resourced Language: Sindhi" by Wazir Ali et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the development of a large corpus for the Sindhi language, which indicates that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors discuss the lack of resources for the Sindhi language and the need for a large corpus. They mention that they have developed a corpus of more than 61 million words, which is a significant dataset.

In the **methodology section**, the authors describe how they collected the corpus from multiple web resources, including news columns, Wikipedia dumps, and social blogs. This section provides details about the sources of the dataset, which is crucial for citation.

I will also check the **experiments section** to see if the authors mention any specific datasets used for evaluation. They refer to the WordSim-353 dataset for intrinsic evaluation of the generated word embeddings, which is another dataset that needs to be documented.

Now, I will compile the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. **Sindhi Corpus**: The authors developed a large corpus of more than 61 million words from various sources. Since this is an original dataset created by the authors, I will cite it as follows:
   > Wazir Ali, Jay Kumar, Junyu Lu, Zenglin Xu. *Word Embedding Based New Corpus for Low-Resourced Language: Sindhi*. Preprint, January 1, 2021.

2. **WordSim-353 Dataset**: The authors translated the English WordSim353 dataset into Sindhi for evaluation purposes. The citation for the original dataset is:
   > Eneko Agirre, Enrique Alfonseca, Keith Hall, Jana Kravalova, Marius Pasca, and Aitor Soroa. *A study on similarity and relatedness using distributional and WordNet-based approaches*. In Proceedings of Human Language Technologies: The 2009 Annual Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics, pages 19â€“27, 2009.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets in a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly identified along with its citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
