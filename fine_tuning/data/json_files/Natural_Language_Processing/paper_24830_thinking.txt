To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Case Study on Contextual Machine Translation in a Professional Scenario of Subtitling" by Sebastian Vincent et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their full citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the impact of machine translation (MT) in subtitling, but I need to look for specific datasets used in the study.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental setup section** where the authors describe the systems and data used. Here, they mention that they utilized outputs from three machine translation systems: GOOGLE, BASE-NMT, and MTCUE. However, I need to determine if any specific datasets were used to train these systems or if they reference any datasets for evaluation.

In the **related work section**, the authors reference the **OpenSubtitles corpus**, which is a dataset of user-submitted subtitles and their translations. This is a significant dataset in the context of machine translation for subtitles, and I will note it down.

I will also check the **results and discussion sections** to see if any additional datasets are mentioned or if there are any specific datasets used for evaluation metrics. However, it appears that the focus is primarily on the performance of the MT systems rather than new datasets.

Now, I will consult the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The citation for the **OpenSubtitles corpus** is as follows:
- Lison, Pierre, JÃ¶rg Tiedemann, and Milen Kouylekov. *OpenSubtitles2018: Statistical rescoring of sentence alignments in large, noisy parallel corpora*. In Proceedings of the Eleventh International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC 2018), Miyazaki, Japan, May. European Language Resources Association (ELRA).

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset identified in the paper. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets referenced in the study.
