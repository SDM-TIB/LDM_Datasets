To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ELGC-Net: Efficient Local-Global Context Aggregation for Remote Sensing Change Detection" by Mubashir Noman et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments on three challenging change detection datasets, which indicates that datasets are present.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used. In this section, they mention three datasets:

1. **LEVIR-CD**: This dataset is described as a large-scale building change detection dataset consisting of 637 high-resolution image pairs taken from Google Earth. The time span of these images ranges from 5 to 14 years, focusing on changes related to building construction and demolition.

2. **DSIFN-CD**: This dataset is noted to contain six high-resolution bi-temporal images covering six cities in China. The dataset is available in cropped sub-image pairs of size 256 × 256.

3. **CDD-CD**: This dataset includes 11 seasonal varying image pairs, with varying spatial sizes. The authors mention that it has been used in a clipped form of size 256 × 256 pixels.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution:

- For **LEVIR-CD**, the citation is:
  > Chen, H., & Shi, Z. (2020). A spatial-temporal attention-based method and a new dataset for remote sensing image change detection. *Remote Sensing*, 12(10), 1662.

- For **DSIFN-CD**, the citation is:
  > Zhang, C., Yue, P., Tapete, D., Jiang, L., Shangguan, B., Huang, L., & Liu, G. (2020). A deeply supervised image fusion network for change detection in high resolution bi-temporal remote sensing images. *ISPRS Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing*, 166, 183-200.

- For **CDD-CD**, the citation is:
  > Lebedev, M., Vizilter, Y. V., Vygolov, O., Knyaz, V. A., & Rubis, A. Y. (2018). Change detection in remote sensing images using conditional adversarial networks. *The International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences*, 42, 1-6.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will allow for a structured output that can be used for further analysis or reference.
