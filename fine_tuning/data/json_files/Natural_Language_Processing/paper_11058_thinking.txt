To extract datasets from the research paper titled "OMNI: Open-Endedness via Models of Human Notions of Interestingness" by Jenny Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions evaluating the proposed method on various environments, which suggests that datasets may be involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors discuss the environments used for evaluation. They mention three specific domains: **Crafter**, **BabyAI**, and **AI2-THOR**. I will need to confirm whether these environments correspond to specific datasets or if they are standalone environments.

In the **methods** section, the authors describe how they evaluate their approach in these environments. I will look for any explicit mention of datasets, including their characteristics, sizes, and any relevant details that define them.

In the **experiments** section, the authors provide results from their evaluations in the three environments. I will check if they reference any datasets used for training or testing their models in these environments.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to ensure that the datasets can be accessed or referenced by others.

Based on the information gathered, I will compile the datasets into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset entry includes:

1. **Name**: The name of the dataset or environment.
2. **Description**: A brief description of the dataset, including its purpose and characteristics.
3. **Citation**: The full citation for the dataset, as found in the references section.

For example, if I find that the **Crafter** environment is based on a specific dataset, I will document it accordingly. If the authors refer to the environments as frameworks rather than datasets, I will note that as well.

Finally, I will ensure that all extracted information is accurate and clearly presented, ready for further processing or review.
