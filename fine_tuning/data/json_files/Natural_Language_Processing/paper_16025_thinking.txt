To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Unsupervised approaches based on optimal transport and convex analysis for inverse problems in imaging" by Marcello Carioni et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a general overview, but I will need to look for specific datasets in the introduction and methods sections where the authors typically describe their experimental setup.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** of the paper, as this is where datasets are most likely to be detailed. I will look for any references to datasets used for training or evaluation, including their names, sizes, and any specific characteristics that are relevant to the study.

If the paper includes a **datasets section**, I will pay close attention to it, as it will likely contain detailed descriptions of each dataset used in the research. I will note down the names of the datasets, their purposes, and any relevant statistics or features mentioned by the authors.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. I will ensure that I capture the authors, title, publication venue, and year for each dataset.

For example, if the authors mention using the "Penn Action Dataset," I will look for its citation in the references. If it is not directly cited, I will search for the original paper that introduced the dataset to ensure I provide an accurate citation.

Finally, I will compile all the extracted information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described with its full citation. This will include the dataset name, a brief description, and the citation formatted correctly.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets used in the research paper, providing a comprehensive overview that can be useful for future research or replication studies.
