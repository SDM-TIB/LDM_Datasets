To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Expanding Frozen Vision-Language Models without Retraining: Towards Improved Robot Perception" by Riley Tavassolia et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of IMU data and visual inputs for human activity recognition, which suggests that datasets related to these modalities may be present.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, specifically **section 3 (Methodology)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. In **subsection 3.1 (Dataset)**, they explicitly mention the **MMAct dataset**. The authors provide a detailed description of this dataset, stating that it consists of 35 different human actions recorded under various conditions, which is crucial for understanding the context of their experiments.

I will also check the **experiments section** to confirm that the MMAct dataset is indeed utilized in their experiments, which will further validate its importance in the study.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citation for the MMAct dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:
> Q. Kong, Z. Wu, Z. Deng, M. Klinkigt, B. Tong, T. Murakami. *MMAct: A large-scale dataset for cross modal human action understanding*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2019.

With this information, I can summarize the dataset extraction process:

1. **Dataset Name**: MMAct
   - **Description**: A large-scale dataset consisting of 35 different human actions with varied durations, recorded on four different cameras in distinct room setups.
   - **Full Citation**: Q. Kong, Z. Wu, Z. Deng, M. Klinkigt, B. Tong, T. Murakami. *MMAct: A large-scale dataset for cross modal human action understanding*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2019.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry into the required format for further processing or review.
