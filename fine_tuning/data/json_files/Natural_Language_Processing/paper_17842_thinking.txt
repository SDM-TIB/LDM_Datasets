To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Decoupling Decision-Making in Fraud Prevention through Classifier Calibration for Business Logic Action" by Emanuele Luzio et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors use a real-world business scenario and multiple ML models, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Decoupling Thresholds from Evolving Models)**, where the authors discuss a specific dataset used for their analysis. They mention the **Bank Account Fraud dataset** and provide details about its characteristics, which confirms that this is a primary dataset for their experiments.

In **section 2.2 (Bank Account Fraud dataset)**, the authors describe the dataset in detail, including its purpose (identifying fraudulent online bank account opening requests), the nature of the data (eight months of applications), and the prevalence of fraud. This section provides a comprehensive overview of the dataset, including its variants.

The paper also mentions **five dataset variants** that follow the same underlying distribution as the base dataset but have different characteristics. These variants are crucial for understanding the breadth of the experiments conducted.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the **Bank Account Fraud dataset**. The authors reference the dataset as being introduced in a paper by Jesus et al. (2022). I will extract the full citation from the references:

- For the **Bank Account Fraud dataset**, the citation is:
  > Sérgio Jesus, José Pombal, Duarte Alves, André Cruz, Pedro Saleiro, Rita Ribeiro, João Gama, and Pedro Bizarro. *Turning the tables: Biased, imbalanced, dynamic tabular datasets for ml evaluation*. Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 35:33563–33575, 2022.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citation for the **Bank Account Fraud dataset** and its variants in the final output.

This structured approach will help ensure that I accurately capture all relevant datasets and their citations from the paper.
