To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CR-LT-KGQA: A Knowledge Graph Question Answering Dataset Requiring Commonsense Reasoning and Long-Tail Knowledge" by Willis Guo et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors created a novel dataset called **CR-LT-KGQA**, which is a clear indication that this is a primary dataset of interest.

Next, I will look for specific details about the **CR-LT-KGQA dataset** in the **methodology section**. The authors describe how they constructed this dataset by extending existing reasoning datasets, specifically **StrategyQA** and **CREAK**, over **Wikidata**. This suggests that both StrategyQA and CREAK are relevant datasets that contributed to the creation of CR-LT-KGQA.

In the **dataset description section**, the authors provide details about the CR-LT-KGQA dataset, including its structure, which consists of 350 queries divided into two subsets: question answering and claim verification. This section confirms that CR-LT-KGQA is the main dataset being introduced.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The relevant citations are:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets referenced in the paper.
