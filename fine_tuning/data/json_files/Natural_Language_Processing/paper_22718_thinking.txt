To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Prompt Exploration with Prompt Regression" by Michael Feffer et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for evaluation. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets, which can help identify them.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as it typically contains detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the study. In this paper, the authors mention several datasets in the context of their experiments, specifically in the **Prompt Regression Experiments** and **Prompt Selection Experiments** sections.

I will identify the datasets mentioned:

1. **Toy Dataset**: This dataset is derived from the databricks-dolly-15k dataset, which is used to generate responses aligned with a specific theme (pirate speech). The citation for this dataset is:
   > Mike Conover, Matt Hayes, Ankit Mathur, Jianwei Xie, Jun Wan, Sam Shah, Ali Ghodsi, Patrick Wendell, Matei Zaharia, and Reynold Xin. *Free dolly: Introducing the world’s first truly open instruction-tuned llm*. Databricks, 2023. URL: https://www.databricks.com/blog/2023/04/12/dolly-first-open-commercially-viable-instruction-tuned-llm.

2. **HateCheck Dataset**: This dataset is used to validate the method against hate speech detection scenarios. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Paul Röttger, Bertram Vidgen, Dong Nguyen, Zeerak Waseem, Helen Margetts, and Janet B. Pierrehumbert. *Hatecheck: Functional tests for hate speech detection models*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2012.15606, 2020.

3. **CAMEL Biology and Physics Datasets**: These datasets are used to test the method on text generation tasks. The citation for these datasets is:
   > Guohao Li, Hasan Abed Al Kader Hammoud, Hani Itani, Dmitrii Khizbullin, and Bernard Ghanem. *Camel: Communicative agents for “mind” exploration of large language model society*. In Thirty-seventh Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems, 2023.

4. **Natural Instructions (NI) Dataset**: This dataset is used for various tasks, including sentiment analysis and agreement detection. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Swaroop Mishra, Daniel Khashabi, Chitta Baral, and Hannaneh Hajishirzi. *Cross-task generalization via natural language crowdsourcing instructions*. In ACL, 2022.

After identifying the datasets and their citations, I will ensure that I have accurately captured the relevant details about each dataset, including their purpose and any specific characteristics mentioned in the paper.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and full citation, ready for further processing or review.
