To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Robust optimization for adversarial learning with finite sample complexity guarantees" by AndrÃ© Bertolace et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted numerical experiments on the **MNIST** and **CIFAR10** datasets, indicating that these datasets are likely to be important for the research.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **Datasets** section or any mention of datasets in the **experiments** section. In this paper, the authors describe their methodology and results, and they specifically mention using the **MNIST** and **CIFAR10** datasets for their numerical experiments. I will note down the details provided about these datasets, including their purpose in the experiments.

In the **experiments** section, the authors provide context for how they utilized the datasets. They mention that the MNIST dataset is used for digit classification tasks, while the CIFAR10 dataset is used for classifying images of animals and vehicles. This contextual information is crucial for understanding the datasets' applications.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **MNIST dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998. Available: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

- For the **CIFAR10 dataset**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009. Available: https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations as required. This structured approach will help me accurately extract and document the datasets used in the research paper.
