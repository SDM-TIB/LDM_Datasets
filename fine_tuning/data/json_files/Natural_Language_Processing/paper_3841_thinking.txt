To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An Automated Method To Enrich Consumer Health Vocabularies Using GloVe Word Embeddings and An Auxiliary Lexical Resource" by Mohammed Ibrahim et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their method using two laymen datasets from the National Library of Medicine (NLM), specifically the **Open-Access Consumer Health Vocabulary (OAC CHV)** and **MedlinePlus Healthcare Vocabulary**. This is a strong indication that these datasets are crucial to the research.

Next, I will look for more detailed descriptions of these datasets in the **methodology section**. The authors mention that the OAC CHV covers about 56,000 concepts mapped to laymen terms, while the MedlinePlus vocabulary is a source of index terms for the MedlinePlus search engine, with 2,112 professional concepts mapped to laymen terms. This confirms the datasets' relevance and provides context for their use in the study.

I will also check the **results and evaluation sections** to see if there are any additional details or statistics related to these datasets. The authors discuss the size and updates of the OAC CHV and MedlinePlus datasets, emphasizing their importance in the context of the research.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For the **Open-Access Consumer Health Vocabulary (OAC CHV)**, the citation is:
  > Doing-Harris KM, Zeng-Treitler Q. *Computer-assisted update of a consumer health vocabulary through mining of social network data*. J Med Internet Res. 2011;13(2):e37.

- For the **MedlinePlus Healthcare Vocabulary**, the citation is:
  > Miller N, Lacroix E-M, Backus JEB. *MEDLINEplus: building and maintaining the National Library of Medicineâ€™s consumer health Web service*. Bull Med Libr Assoc. 2000;88(1):11-17.

Having gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.
