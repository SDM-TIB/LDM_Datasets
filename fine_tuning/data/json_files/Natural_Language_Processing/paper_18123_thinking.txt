To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Artificial Intelligence-based algorithms in medical image scan segmentation and intelligent visual-content generation - a concise overview" by Zofia Rudnicka et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a general overview of the paper's focus on AI algorithms in medical imaging, but it does not specify any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the subsequent sections.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of AI in medical imaging but do not mention specific datasets. I will continue to the **materials and methods** section, where the authors describe their systematic review methodology. Here, they reference various databases and datasets used in their analysis, which is crucial for identifying specific datasets.

Next, I will look for a **table or list** that summarizes the datasets used in the studies they reviewed. In this paper, there is a **Table 2** that summarizes publicly available retrospective image scan medical databases. This table is likely to contain the dataset names, descriptions, and relevant citations.

Upon reviewing Table 2, I will extract the following datasets:

1. **Physionet**: A repository for various medical datasets, including EEG and x-ray images.
   - Citation: PhysioNet. Available online: https://physionet.org/ (accessed on January 8, 2024).

2. **National Sleep Research Resource**: Contains polysomnographic recordings and other sleep-related datasets.
   - Citation: National Sleep Research Resource. Available online: https://sleepdata.org/ (accessed on January 8, 2024).

3. **Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA)**: A large collection of medical images for cancer research.
   - Citation: The Cancer Imaging Archive. Available online: https://www.cancerimagingarchive.net/ (accessed on January 8, 2024).

4. **LIDC-IDRI**: A dataset for lung cancer research that includes annotated CT scans.
   - Citation: LIDC-IDRI. Available online: https://wiki.cancerimagingarchive.net/display/Public/LIDC-IDRI (accessed on January 8, 2024).

5. **DRIVE and STARE datasets**: Used for retinal vessel segmentation.
   - Citation: DRIVE dataset. Available online: https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/kaggle-eyepacs (accessed on January 8, 2024).

After identifying these datasets, I will ensure to note their full citations as they are essential for proper referencing. 

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format for easy access and review, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its citation.
