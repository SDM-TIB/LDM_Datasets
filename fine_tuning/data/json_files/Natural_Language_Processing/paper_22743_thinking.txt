To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Study on Optimization Techniques for Variational Quantum Circuits in Reinforcement Learning" by Michael KÃ¶lle et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of environments like **Frozen Lake** and **Cart Pole**, which suggests that these may be the datasets or environments used in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental setup section** (Section IV) where the authors describe the environments used for their experiments. In **Section IV-A**, they specifically mention:

1. **Frozen Lake**: A modified environment used to evaluate data re-uploading and output scaling. The paper describes it as a simple grid-based environment where the agent must navigate from a start point to a goal while avoiding holes.

2. **Cart Pole**: This environment is used to evaluate input scaling and exponential learning rate decay. It involves balancing a pole on a cart, which is a common benchmark in reinforcement learning.

I will also check the **References section** to find full citations for these environments. The Frozen Lake environment is a part of the OpenAI Gym library, and the Cart Pole environment is also included in the same library. Therefore, I will cite the OpenAI Gym paper for both environments.

The citations I will use are:

- For **Frozen Lake** and **Cart Pole**:
  > Greg Brockman, Vicki Cheung, Ludwig Pettersson, Jonas Schneider, John Schulman, Jie Tang, and Wojciech Zaremba. *OpenAI Gym*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01540, 2016.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required.

In summary, the datasets extracted from the paper are:
1. **Frozen Lake**: A grid-based environment for reinforcement learning.
2. **Cart Pole**: A balancing task for reinforcement learning.

Both datasets are part of the OpenAI Gym library, and I will use the citation provided above for both. This structured approach ensures that I have accurately identified and documented the datasets used in the research paper.
