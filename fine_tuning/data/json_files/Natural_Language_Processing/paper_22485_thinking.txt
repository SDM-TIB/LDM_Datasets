To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Generating Human Motion in 3D Scenes from Text Descriptions" by Zhi Cen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. In the abstract, the authors mention that their method is trained and tested on the **HUMANISE dataset** and that it generalizes to the **PROX dataset**. This indicates that both datasets are relevant to their research.

Next, I will look for specific details about these datasets in the **experiments section**. The authors state that they conducted thorough comparative experiments on the **HUMANISE dataset** and also mention the **PROX dataset** in the context of generalization. I will need to gather more information about these datasets, such as their characteristics, size, and purpose.

In the **related work section**, the authors reference the **HUMANISE dataset** and provide a citation, which is crucial for documenting the dataset properly. They also mention the **AMASS dataset** as a source for pre-training their models, which is relevant for understanding the context of the HUMANISE dataset.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to retrieve full citations for each dataset:

1. **HUMANISE Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Zan Wang, Yixin Chen, Tengyu Liu, Yixin Zhu, Wei Liang, and Siyuan Huang. *Humanise: Language-conditioned human motion generation in 3D scenes*. In NeurIPS, 2022.

2. **AMASS Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Naureen Mahmood, Nima Ghorbani, Nikolaus F Troje, Gerard Pons-Moll, and Michael J Black. *Amass: Archive of motion capture as surface shapes*. In ICCV, 2019.

3. **PROX Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Mohamed Hassan, Vasileios Choutas, Dimitrios Tzionas, and Michael J. Black. *Resolving 3D human pose ambiguities with 3D scene constraints*. In ICCV, 2019.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset's name, description, and full citation. This will ensure that the datasets are accurately represented and can be referenced appropriately in future work.
