To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Rewarding What Matters: Step-by-Step Reinforcement Learning for Task-Oriented Dialogue" by Huifang Du et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors achieved state-of-the-art results on three widely used datasets: **MultiWOZ2.0, MultiWOZ2.1, and In-Car**. This is a strong indication that these datasets are crucial to the research.

Next, I will check the **experiments section** (specifically section 5) where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used. In this section, they mention:

1. **MultiWOZ2.0**: A challenging benchmark for evaluating task-oriented dialogue systems, consisting of 8,438 dialogues for training, and 1,000 each for validation and testing.

2. **MultiWOZ2.1**: An updated version of MultiWOZ2.0, which includes corrections and state tracking baselines.

3. **In-Car Dataset**: Comprising 3,031 multi-turn dialogues across three specific domains suitable for an in-car assistant, with a training/validation/testing split of 2425/302/304 dialogues.

I will also look at the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations.
