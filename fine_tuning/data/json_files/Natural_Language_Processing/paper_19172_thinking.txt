To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Minimal Constraint Violation Probability in Model Predictive Control for Linear Systems" by Michael Fink et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the work, which may include references to datasets used in the study.

Next, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets in the **methodology or experiments sections**. These sections typically detail the experimental setup and the data used for validation, which is crucial for identifying specific datasets.

I will also check the **results and discussion sections** to see if the authors refer to any datasets when discussing their findings or comparing their results with previous work. This could provide additional context or confirm the datasets used.

After identifying potential datasets, I will consult the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. It is essential to ensure that I have the correct and complete citation for each dataset, as this is a critical requirement.

For this paper, I will specifically look for any datasets related to model predictive control, stochastic control, or any numerical simulations mentioned. If the authors refer to well-known datasets, I will ensure to include their full citations.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each entry is clear and accurately reflects the content of the paper.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ready for further processing or review.
