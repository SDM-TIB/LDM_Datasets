To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Occlusion-Aware Deep Convolutional Neural Network via Homogeneous Tanh-transforms for Face Parsing" by Jianhua Qiu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental evaluation sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors contribute a new cleaned face parsing dataset, which suggests that there are datasets involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention the challenges of face parsing under occlusion and refer to the need for datasets that address these challenges. This reinforces the idea that datasets are crucial to their research.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental evaluation section** where the authors explicitly discuss the datasets used. They mention the **Sheltered Face Parsing Dataset (SFPD)**, which is a new dataset they created. The authors provide details about this dataset, including that it contains **52,097 images** collected from various sources, including CelebAMask-HQ, Short-video Face Parsing, and the HELEN dataset. They also describe the dataset's annotation categories, which include 11 face regions and 3 occlusions.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The citations for the datasets used in the study are as follows:

1. **CelebAMask-HQ**:

2. **Short-video Face Parsing**:

3. **HELEN Dataset**:
   > Le, V., Brandt, J., Lin, Z., Bourdev, L., Huang, T.S. (2012). *Interactive facial feature localization*. In European conference on computer vision, Springer, pp. 679–692.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. The key dataset extracted is the **Sheltered Face Parsing Dataset (SFPD)**, which is a significant contribution of this paper.
