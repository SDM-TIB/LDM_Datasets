To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Closing the loop: Autonomous experiments enabled by machine-learning-based online data analysis in synchrotron beamline environments" by Linus Pithan et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, results, and conclusion sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on machine learning in X-ray scattering experiments, which suggests that datasets related to these experiments may be included.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **methods section**. Here, the authors describe the integration of machine learning into a closed-loop workflow for X-ray reflectometry (XRR). They mention that the data is stored in a NeXus file format and is publicly available through the ESRF data portal. This indicates that there are datasets associated with the experiments conducted.

In the **results section**, the authors discuss the outcomes of their experiments and may reference specific datasets used for analysis. I will pay attention to any figures or tables that might summarize the datasets or their characteristics.

I will also check the **data availability statement** and **references section** for any explicit citations of datasets. The authors mention that the data underlying the publication is available in the ESRF data repository and provide a DOI for the dataset, which is crucial for proper citation.

From the text, I identify the following datasets:

1. **Dataset of Reflectometry Curves (XRR and NR)**: This dataset includes reflectometry curves and corresponding fits for machine learning analysis. The authors provide a DOI for this dataset:
   > Pithan, L., Greco, A., Hinderhofer, A., Gerlach, A., Kowarik, S., Rußegger, N., Dax, I. & Schreiber, F. (2022). Reflectometry curves (XRR and NR) and corresponding fits for machine learning. Dataset. Publisher Zenodo. DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.6497437. [Link](https://zenodo.org/record/6497438)

2. **Controlled Thin Film Growth Dataset**: This dataset contains data related to controlled thin film growth through machine-learning-based closed-loop feedback with online X-ray scattering analysis. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Pithan, L., Starostin, V., Marecek, D., Petersdorf, L., Völter, C., Munteanu, V., Jankowski, M., Konovalov, O., Gerlach, A., Hinderhofer, A., Murphy, B., Kowarik, S. & Schreiber, F. (2023). Controlled thin film growth through machine-learning based closed-loop feedback with online X-ray scattering analysis. Dataset. Publisher ESRF. DOI: 10.15151/ESRF-DC-1249105707. [Link](https://doi.esrf.fr/10.15151/ESRF-DC-1249105707)

After identifying these datasets, I will ensure to note their full citations accurately, as they are essential for proper referencing in any subsequent work or analysis. Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format for easy access and review.
