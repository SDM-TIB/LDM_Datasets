To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Evaluating the Factual Consistency of Large Language Models Through News Summarization" by Derek Tam et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract introduces a benchmark called FIB (Factual Inconsistency Benchmark) and mentions that it involves comparing factually consistent and inconsistent summaries, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **related work section** where the authors discuss various factuality evaluation datasets. Here, they mention several datasets that are relevant to their work:

1. **FRANK Benchmark**: Introduced by Pagnoni et al. (2021), it contains 2,250 model-generated summaries with factuality labels for each summary sentence.
   
2. **GO FIGURE**: Proposed by Gabriel et al. (2021), this framework includes 1,500 model-generated summaries with factuality labels.

3. **FactCollect**: Created by Ribeiro et al. (2022), this dataset combines labeled datasets from four works, containing over 9,000 summary sentences and their factuality labels.

4. **XSum Dataset**: Mentioned as a source for factually consistent summaries, it consists of English documents about news from the BBC, with a total of 204K examples.

5. **CNN/DM Dataset**: Used for extractive summarization, this dataset consists of English documents from CNN/Daily Mail, with 287K training examples.

In the **experiments section**, the authors confirm that they used the **XSum** and **CNN/DM** datasets for their evaluations. This reinforces the importance of these datasets in their research.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
