To extract datasets from the research paper titled "L2CEval: Evaluating Language-to-Code Generation Capabilities of Large Language Models" by Ansong Ni et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the evaluation framework, and I will look for specific mentions of datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly any subsections that explicitly discuss datasets. In this paper, the authors mention several datasets in Table 1, which summarizes the datasets evaluated across different tasks. I will extract the names of these datasets along with their descriptions.

The datasets mentioned in the paper include:

1. **Spider**: A large-scale human-labeled dataset for complex and cross-domain semantic parsing and text-to-SQL tasks.
2. **WikiTQ**: A dataset for semantic parsing that consists of natural language questions and their corresponding SQL queries.
3. **GSM8k**: A dataset containing grade-school level math problems described in natural language.
4. **SVAMP**: A dataset of math word problems designed to evaluate reasoning abilities.
5. **MBPP**: A dataset for evaluating programming skills, containing natural language specifications and corresponding Python functions.
6. **HumanEval**: A dataset for evaluating code generation capabilities, consisting of function headers and docstrings.
7. **DS-1000**: A dataset for data science code generation tasks.

After identifying these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and will be formatted as follows:

- **Spider**:

Finally, I will compile the dataset names along with their descriptions and citations into a structured format for easy reference and further processing. This systematic approach ensures that I accurately capture all relevant information regarding the datasets used in the research paper.
