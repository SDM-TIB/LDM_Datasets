To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Curricular Subgoals for Inverse Reinforcement Learning" by Shunyu Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to look for any references to datasets. The abstract mentions experiments conducted on the **D4RL and autonomous driving benchmarks**, indicating that these are likely datasets used in the research.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** in detail, particularly the subsections where the authors describe their experimental setup. In this section, they explicitly mention two benchmarks:

1. **D4RL Benchmark**: This benchmark is referenced multiple times, and the authors specify that they evaluate their method on two D4RL environments: **AntUMaze** and **Relocate**. I will note the details provided about these environments, including the state and action spaces.

2. **Autonomous Driving Benchmark**: The authors describe various scenarios within this benchmark, including **Highway-fast**, **Merge**, **Roundabout**, and **Intersection**. Each scenario has a defined state space and action space, which I will summarize.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The paper cites the D4RL benchmark as follows:
- For the D4RL benchmark, the citation is:
  > Justin Fu, Aviral Kumar, Ofir Nachum, George Tucker, and Sergey Levine. *D4RL: Datasets for Deep Data-Driven Reinforcement Learning*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2004.07219, 2020.

For the autonomous driving benchmark, the authors mention generating expert demonstrations using an optimal planning algorithm, but they do not provide a specific citation for this dataset. Therefore, I will note that the dataset is generated from a planning algorithm without a formal citation.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citations for the datasets identified. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.
