To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SR-PredictAO: Session-based Recommendation with High-Capability Predictor Add-On" by Ruida Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. In the abstract, the authors mention conducting experiments on "two real benchmark datasets," which indicates that datasets are indeed present in the paper. I will note this and look for specific names in the subsequent sections.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section V), where the authors typically provide details about the datasets used. In this section, they explicitly mention two datasets:

1. **Yoochoose**: This dataset is described as being obtained from the RecSys Challenge 2015, containing user sessions of click events from an online retailer.

2. **Diginetica**: This dataset is released by the CIKM Cup 2016 and includes user sessions extracted from e-commerce search engine logs.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. 

For the **Yoochoose dataset**, the citation is:
> RecSys Challenge 2015. *Yoochoose Dataset*. Available at: http://2015.recsyschallenge.com/challenge.html.

For the **Diginetica dataset**, the citation is:
> CIKM Cup 2016. *Diginetica Dataset*. Available at: http://cikm2016.cs.iupui.edu/cikm-cup.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset's name, description, and citation.

Finally, I will ensure that the dataset entries are ready for any further processing or review, maintaining clarity and accuracy in the information presented.
