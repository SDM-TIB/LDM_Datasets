To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multiply Robust Estimation for Local Distribution Shifts with Multiple Domains" by Steven Wilkins-Reeves et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on both synthetic and real datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors mention using a "user city prediction dataset from a large technology company" in the context of their experiments. This indicates that there is at least one dataset that needs to be documented.

I will also check the **experiments section** for any additional datasets used in their evaluations. The authors mention conducting experiments on several datasets, including:

1. **Adult Dataset**: This dataset is used for binary classification tasks and is sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
2. **Banking Dataset**: Another dataset from the UCI repository, used for classification tasks.
3. **Apartment Dataset**: A regression dataset also sourced from the UCI repository.
4. **Online News Dataset**: This dataset is used for regression tasks and is sourced from the UCI repository.
5. **Customer Segmentation Dataset**: Sourced from Kaggle, this dataset is used for multi-class classification tasks.
6. **User City Prediction Dataset**: This dataset is used for predicting user locations based on interactions and is derived from a large technology company.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. The citations are as follows:

- **Adult Dataset**:

- **Banking Dataset**:
  > Dua, D., & Graff, C. (2017). UCI Machine Learning Repository. Retrieved from http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/banking

- **Apartment Dataset**:
  > Dua, D., & Graff, C. (2017). UCI Machine Learning Repository. Retrieved from http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/apartment

- **Online News Dataset**:
  > Dua, D., & Graff, C. (2017). UCI Machine Learning Repository. Retrieved from http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/online+news

- **Customer Segmentation Dataset**:
  > Vetrivel, P. (2021). Kaggle: Customer segmentation. Retrieved from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vetrirah/customer

- **User City Prediction Dataset**:
  > [Citation not provided in the paper; typically, this would be cited as a proprietary dataset from the technology company.]

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
