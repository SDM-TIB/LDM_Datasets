To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Unsupervised Estimation of Ensemble Accuracy" by Simi Haber and Yonatan Wexler, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that the method is demonstrated on "popular large-scale face recognition datasets," which indicates that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors provide a table listing the datasets used. In this section, I will look for specific dataset names, characteristics, and any references provided.

Upon reviewing the **experiments section**, I find the following datasets listed in Table 1:

1. **CelebsA**: This dataset contains 10,000 identities and 200,000 samples. The reference for this dataset is provided as [11].

2. **DigiFace1M**: This dataset contains 100,000 identities and 1,220,000 samples. The reference for this dataset is provided as [2].

Now, I will check the **References section** to retrieve the full citations for these datasets:

- For **CelebsA**, the citation is:
  > Ziwei Liu, Ping Luo, Xiaogang Wang, and Xiaoou Tang. *Deep learning face attributes in the wild*. In Proceedings of International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), December 2015.

- For **DigiFace1M**, the citation is:
  > Gwangbin Bae, Martin de La Gorce, Tadas Baltru≈°aitis, Charlie Hewitt, Dong Chen, Julien Valentin, Roberto Cipolla, and Jingjing Shen. *Digiface-1m: 1 million digital face images for face recognition*. In 2023 IEEE Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV). IEEE, 2023.

With the dataset names and their full citations in hand, I will now compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
