To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ARN: Analogical Reasoning on Narratives" by Zhivar Sourati et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are introduced or referenced. The abstract mentions a benchmark for Analogical Reasoning on Narratives (ARN), which suggests that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will look into **section 4 (ARN Benchmark)**, where the authors describe the realization of their framework. Here, they explicitly mention using the **ePiC dataset** as the narrative database, which consists of 2,500 short narratives annotated with proverbs. This is a clear indication of a dataset being utilized.

In this section, the authors also detail how they modified the ePiC dataset to ensure that the narratives reflect the associated proverbs accurately. This indicates that the ePiC dataset is central to their research.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the ePiC dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:
> Ghosh, S., & Srivastava, S. (2022). ePiC: Employing proverbs in context as a benchmark for abstract language understanding. In Proceedings of the 60th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers), pages 3989â€“4004, Dublin, Ireland. Association for Computational Linguistics.

Additionally, I will note that the authors created a new benchmark called **ARN**, which consists of 1,096 triples of query narratives, analogies, and distractors. However, since ARN is a product of their research rather than an existing dataset, I will not include it in the dataset citations.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citation for the ePiC dataset as it is crucial for proper attribution and further research.

In summary, the key dataset extracted from the paper is the ePiC dataset, and I will document it with its full citation for clarity and completeness.
