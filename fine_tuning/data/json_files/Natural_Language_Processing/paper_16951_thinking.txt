To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards A Flexible Accuracy-Oriented Deep Learning Module Inference Latency Prediction Framework" by Jingran Shen et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental evaluation sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses a framework for predicting DNN module inference latency and mentions the use of self-generated datasets for training regression models. This indicates that there are datasets involved, but I need to find more specific details.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology or experimental sections**. In the introduction, the authors mention the need for training data samples constructed from various parameters, which suggests that they are generating datasets based on their framework.

In the **experimental evaluation section**, the authors state that they generated **10,000 samples for convolutional modules and 2,000 samples for other modules**. This indicates that they created their own datasets for the experiments, but I need to confirm if they provide any specific names or references for these datasets.

Since the datasets are self-generated, I will note that they do not have formal citations like publicly available datasets. However, I will still document the details of these datasets, including the number of samples and the types of modules they pertain to.

Now, I will compile the information I have gathered:

1. **Self-Generated Dataset for Convolutional Modules**: Contains 10,000 samples constructed from various sampling parameters for training regression models.
2. **Self-Generated Dataset for Other Modules**: Contains 2,000 samples constructed similarly for training regression models.

Since these datasets are self-generated and do not have formal citations, I will note that in the dataset entries.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format, ensuring to include the details about the datasets and their characteristics, even though they lack formal citations.

After completing this process, I will have a clear and organized representation of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
