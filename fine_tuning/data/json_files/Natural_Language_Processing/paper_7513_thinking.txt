To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A New Kind of Adversarial Example" by Ali Borji, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information accurately, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the experimental results are based on the **MNIST** and **CIFAR-10** datasets, which indicates that these datasets are used in the research. This is a good starting point for identifying the datasets.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (section 3) to gather more details about how these datasets were utilized. The author mentions training a CNN on the MNIST dataset and a ResNet50 on the CIFAR-10 dataset, confirming their use in the experiments. I will note any specific details about the datasets, such as their characteristics or the context in which they were used.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets are well-known, so I will look for their authoritative citations:

1. For the **MNIST dataset**, the citation is:
   > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998. Available: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

2. For the **CIFAR-10 dataset**, the citation is:
   > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009. Available: https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for any further processing or review.
