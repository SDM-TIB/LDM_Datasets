To extract datasets from the research paper titled "High Order Reasoning for Time Critical Recommendation in Evidence-based Medicine" by Manjiang Yu and Xueli, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and dataset sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the use of a model for recommendations in evidence-based medicine, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and the need for real-world data to evaluate their effectiveness. This indicates that a specific dataset is being utilized for their experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **dataset section** of the paper, where the authors explicitly mention the **eICU dataset**. They describe it as a comprehensive ICU database from the US, providing de-identified, high-resolution data on ICU admissions. The paper states that access to this public database requires registration and a data use agreement, which is important for understanding the dataset's accessibility.

The authors also compare the eICU dataset with the MIMIC-III database, indicating a clear choice for using eICU due to its structured documentation and diagnosis-treatment correlation. This reinforces the significance of the eICU dataset in their research.

Now, I will retrieve the full citation for the eICU dataset from the **references section** of the paper. The citation is as follows:
> Pollard, T. J., Johnson, A. E. W., Raffa, J. D., Celi, L. A., Mark, R. G., & Badawi, O. (2018). The eICU Collaborative Research Database, a freely available multi-center database for critical care research. *Scientific Data*, 5(1), 1-13.

Since the eICU dataset is the primary dataset mentioned in the paper, I will document it accordingly.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring that I include the full citation for the eICU dataset as it is crucial for proper attribution and reference in any subsequent work or analysis.
