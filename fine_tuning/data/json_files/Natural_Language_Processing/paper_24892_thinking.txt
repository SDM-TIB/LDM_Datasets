To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Reliable Projection Based Unsupervised Learning for Semi-Definite QCQP with Application of Beamforming Optimization" by Xiucheng Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and while it may not explicitly mention datasets, it can give clues about the experiments conducted.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors may discuss the context of their research and any datasets used for validation or comparison. If they mention specific datasets or benchmarks, I will note them down.

Then, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors describe their simulation experiments, which may involve specific datasets generated for testing their proposed methods. I will pay attention to any details about the datasets, such as their size, characteristics, and how they were generated or used.

In the **results section**, the authors may provide performance metrics based on the datasets used, which can further confirm the datasets' relevance and importance in their research.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, if the authors mention a dataset generated from Gaussian distributions, I will look for the original source or any relevant papers that describe this dataset in detail. If they refer to existing datasets, I will ensure to find the correct citations for those as well.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, including their names, descriptions, and citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference.

Finally, I will ensure that each dataset entry includes the full citation, as this is essential for academic integrity and for others who may wish to use the datasets in their own research.
