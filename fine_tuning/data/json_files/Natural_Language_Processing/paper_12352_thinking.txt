To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Investigating the Factual Knowledge Boundary of Large Language Models with Retrieval Augmentation" by Ruiyang Ren et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the study involves knowledge-intensive tasks and open-domain question answering (QA), which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 2.3.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention three benchmark datasets:

1. **Natural Questions (NQ)**: This dataset is constructed from Google Search queries and includes annotated short answers or documents (long answers). The citation for this dataset is:
   > Tom Kwiatkowski, Jennimaria Palomaki, Olivia Redfield, Michael Collins, Ankur Parikh, Chris Alberti, Danielle Epstein, Illia Polosukhin, Jacob Devlin, Kenton Lee, Kristina Toutanova. *Natural Questions: A Benchmark for Question Answering Research*. Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics, 7:452–466, 2019.

2. **TriviaQA**: This dataset consists of trivia questions with annotated answers and corresponding evidence documents. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Mandar Joshi, Eunsol Choi, Daniel Weld, and Luke Zettlemoyer. *TriviaQA: A Large Scale Distantly Supervised Challenge Dataset for Reading Comprehension*. In Proceedings of the 55th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers), pages 1601–1611, 2017.

3. **HotpotQA**: This dataset is a collection of question-answer pairs that require multi-hop reasoning, collected through Amazon Mechanical Turk. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Zhilin Yang, Peng Qi, Saizheng Zhang, Yoshua Bengio, William Cohen, Ruslan Salakhutdinov, and Christopher D. Manning. *HotpotQA: A Dataset for Diverse, Explainable Multi-hop Question Answering*. In Proceedings of the 2018 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 2369–2380, 2018.

After identifying these datasets, I will ensure to verify their usage in the **experiments section** to confirm that they were indeed utilized in the study. The authors mention conducting experiments on the test set of NQ and the development sets of TriviaQA and HotpotQA, which confirms their relevance.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries along with their full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its corresponding reference. This structured approach will help in creating a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
