To extract datasets from the research paper titled "TeLeS: Temporal Lexeme Similarity Score to Estimate Confidence in End-to-End ASR" by Nagarathna Ravi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments with ASR models trained in three languages: Hindi, Tamil, and Kannada. This suggests that datasets for these languages are likely discussed in detail.

Next, I will focus on **section IV (CEM Evaluation)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for training their ASR models. Here, they mention:

1. **Hindi Dataset**: This dataset is a combination of speech data from various domains, totaling approximately 100 hours. It includes about 17.6 hours from the Common Voice Hindi (CVH) dataset and additional data from the Prasar Bharati archive.

2. **Tamil Dataset**: The authors refer to the benchmark IISc-MILE Tamil speech corpus, which comprises approximately 150 hours of training and testing data.

3. **Kannada Dataset**: The benchmark IISc-MILE Kannada dataset is mentioned, which consists of around 350 hours of training and testing data.

In the same section, the authors also note that they used the **KathBath (KB)** test-known datasets for evaluating their models, which are crucial for assessing performance on mismatched domain datasets.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Common Voice Hindi (CVH) dataset**, the citation is:
  > R. Ardila, M. Branson, K. Davis, M. Henretty, M. Kohler, J. Meyer, R. Morais, L. Saunders, F. M. Tyers, and G. Weber. *Common voice: A massively-multilingual speech corpus*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1912.06670, 2019.

- For the **IISc-MILE Tamil dataset**, the citation is:
  > Pilar, Bharathi. *Knowledge-driven Subword Grammar Modeling for Automatic Speech Recognition in Tamil and Kannada*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2207.13333, 2022.

- For the **IISc-MILE Kannada dataset**, the citation is:
  > Pilar, Bharathi. *Subword Dictionary Learning and Segmentation Techniques for Automatic Speech Recognition in Tamil and Kannada*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2207.13331, 2022.

- For the **KathBath (KB) dataset**, the citation is:
  > Javed, Tahir, et al. *Indicsuperb: A speech processing universal performance benchmark for Indian languages*. Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, Vol. 37, No. 11, 2023.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This structured approach will help in creating a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
