To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Surround-View Fisheye Optics in Computer Vision and Simulation: Survey and Challenges" by Daniel Jakab et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and relevant sections** of the paper to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the paper discusses the need for comprehensive datasets for testing safety-critical scenarios in vehicle automation, which suggests that datasets may be referenced.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors discuss the importance of datasets for developing, training, and deploying computer vision models in the context of automotive applications. They mention the creation of datasets of images from automotive scenes, which implies that specific datasets may be listed later in the paper.

I will then look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments or methodology sections**. In this paper, the authors reference two significant datasets:

1. **BDD100k Dataset**: This dataset is mentioned as one of the largest automotive datasets, containing over 100,000 driving videos collected from various locations. It is used for training computer vision algorithms for research.

2. **Woodscape Dataset**: This dataset is highlighted as the first of its kind to address surround-view cameras for automated driving, containing 10,000 publicly released images from three distinct locations.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access the datasets.

The full citations I will extract are:

- For **BDD100k Dataset**:
  > Yu, F., Chen, H., Wang, X., Xian, W., Chen, Y., Liu, F., Madhavan, V., & Darrell, T. (2020). BDD100K: A diverse driving dataset for heterogeneous multitask learning. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2636–2645.

- For **Woodscape Dataset**:
  > Yogamani, S., Hughes, C., Horgan, J., Sistu, G., Varley, P., O'Dea, D., Uricar, M., Milz, S., Simon, M., Amende, K., et al. (2019). Woodscape: A multi-task, multi-camera fisheye dataset for autonomous driving. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 9308–9318.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all necessary information is accurately represented for future reference or processing.
