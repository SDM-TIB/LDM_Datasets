To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "AaKOS: Aspect-adaptive Knowledge-based Opinion Summarization" by Guan Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the model and mentions that extensive experiments were conducted using real-world datasets, which indicates that datasets are present.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention three datasets:

1. **Amazon Product Review dataset**: This dataset is described as a large collection of millions of product reviews from Amazon, covering 46 categories. The authors specify that they focus on the top 10 categories with the highest number of reviews.

2. **SPACE dataset**: This dataset is a compilation of hotel reviews sourced from TripAdvisor, featuring human-written abstractive opinion summaries intended for evaluation purposes.

3. **YELP dataset**: This dataset consists of businesses, reviews, and user data from Yelp. The authors also mention that they collected reference summaries from Amazon Mechanical Turk for evaluation purposes.

To ensure I have the correct citations, I will check the **Data Availability section** at the end of the paper, where the authors provide links to access these datasets:

- For the **Amazon Product Review dataset**, the citation is:
  > Amazon. *Amazon Product Review dataset*. Available at: https://s3.amazonaws.com/amazon-reviews-pds/tsv/index.txt.

- For the **SPACE dataset**, the citation is:
  > Amplayo, R.K., Angelidis, S., Lapata, M. *SPACE dataset*. Available at: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1C6SaRQkas2B-9MolbwZbl0fuLgqdSKDT&authuser=0.

- For the **YELP dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yelp. *Yelp Open Dataset*. Available at: https://www.yelp.com/dataset.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations.
