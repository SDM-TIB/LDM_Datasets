To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-Task Learning for Arousal and Sleep Stage Detection Using Fully Convolutional Networks" by Hasan Zan and Abdulnasır Yıldız, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their model on two datasets: the **Sleep Heart Health Study (SHHS)** and the **Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA)**. This is a strong indication that these datasets are crucial to the research.

Next, I will look into **section 2 (Datasets)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used. Here, they explicitly mention both datasets and provide context about their content and purpose:

1. **Sleep Heart Health Study (SHHS)**: This dataset consists of polysomnography (PSG) recordings from various centers, focusing on how breathing problems during sleep affect heart diseases. It includes a large number of recordings and detailed annotations by sleep experts.

2. **Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA)**: This dataset is designed to track individuals over time to investigate factors associated with cardiovascular disease. It also includes PSG recordings and expert annotations.

In this section, the authors provide specific details about the recordings, the number of participants, and the types of data collected, which are essential for understanding the datasets' scope and application.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets:

- For the **Sleep Heart Health Study (SHHS)**, the citation is:
  > Quan, S. F., Howard, B. V., Iber, C., Kiley, J. P., Nieto, F. J., O'Connor, G. T., Rapoport, D. M., Redline, S., Robbins, J., Samet, J. M., & Wahl, P. W. (1997). The Sleep Heart Health Study: Design, Rationale, and Methods. *Sleep*, 20(12), 1077-1085.

- For the **Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA)**, the citation is:
  > Chen, X., Wang, R., Zee, P., Lutsey, P. L., Javaheri, S., Alcántara, C. L., Jackson, C. L., Williams, M. A., & Redline, S. (2015). Racial/Ethnic Differences in Sleep Disturbances: The Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA). *Sleep*, 38(6), 877-888.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use. This will ensure that the datasets are properly documented and can be referenced accurately in future research or applications.
