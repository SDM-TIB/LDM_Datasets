To extract datasets from the research paper titled "From DDMs to DNNs: Using process data and models of decision-making to improve human-AI interactions" by Mrugsen Nagsen Gopnarayan, Jaan Aru, and Sebastian Gluth, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a high-level overview, but the introduction and methods sections are likely to contain more specific details about the datasets used in the research.

Next, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets in the **results or discussion sections**. These sections often provide insights into the data used for experiments and analyses, including any datasets that were collected or utilized.

While reading through the paper, I will pay attention to any references to specific datasets, including their names and descriptions. If the authors mention any datasets, I will note down their characteristics, such as the type of data they contain, the number of samples, and any relevant details about how they were collected or used in the study.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets if needed.

For example, if the authors reference a dataset like the "Penn Action Dataset," I will look for the complete citation in the references section, ensuring that I capture all necessary details such as the authors, title, publication venue, and year.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation.

Finally, I will organize this information clearly, ready for any further processing or presentation as needed.
