To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Query-focused Extractive Summarisation for Biomedical and COVID-19 Complex Question Answering" by Diego Mollá, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract indicates participation in BioASQ tasks, which suggests that datasets related to these tasks may be discussed.

Next, I will look for specific sections that typically contain dataset information, such as **section 3 (The Synergy Tasks)** and **section 4 (BioASQ10b, Phase B)**. In these sections, the author discusses the BioASQ tasks and the datasets used for training and evaluation.

In section 3, the author mentions the **CORD-19 dataset**, which is used for document retrieval in the Synergy tasks. This dataset is crucial for understanding the context of the questions being answered.

In section 4, the author refers to the **BioASQ10b training data**, which is used for the question-answering tasks. This dataset is significant as it directly relates to the experiments conducted in the paper.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **CORD-19 dataset**, the citation is:

A., Rishi, D., Sheehan, J., Shen, Z., Stilson, B., Wade, A. D., Wang, K., Wang, N. X. R., Wilhelm, C., Xie, B., Raymond, D. M., Weld, D. S., Kohlmeier, S., & Etzioni, O. (2020).

2. For the **BioASQ datasets**, the citation is:

After identifying the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and future reference. This will ensure that I have accurately documented the datasets used in the research paper, along with their full citations.
