To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Bring More Attention to Syntactic Symmetry for Automatic Postediting of High-Quality Machine Translations" by Baikjin Jung et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiment sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research but does not specify datasets. The introduction discusses the context of Automatic Postediting (APE) but does not mention specific datasets either.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiment)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention:

1. **eSCAPE-NMT**: A cleansed subset of eSCAPE’s English–German-NMT set, with a training size of 5,065,187 examples.
2. **WMT 2019**: Used for validation and testing, with sizes of 13,442 for validation, 1,000 for the validation set, and 1,023 for the test set.

The authors also clarify that the cleansing procedure for eSCAPE-NMT is a reproduction of a previous study by Shin et al. (2021), which indicates that this dataset is derived from an established source.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **eSCAPE-NMT**, the citation is:
  > Matteo Negri, Marco Turchi, Rajen Chatterjee, and Nicola Bertoldi. *eSCAPE: a Large-scale Synthetic Corpus for Automatic Post-Editing*. In Proceedings of the Eleventh International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC 2018), pages 24–30, Miyazaki, Japan, 2018. European Language Resources Association (ELRA).

- For **WMT 2019**, the citation is:
  > Rajen Chatterjee, Christian Federmann, Matteo Negri, and Marco Turchi. *Findings of the WMT 2019 Shared Task on Automatic Post-Editing*. In Proceedings of the Fourth Conference on Machine Translation (Volume 3: Shared Task Papers, Day 2), pages 11–28, Florence, Italy, 2019. Association for Computational Linguistics.

With these citations in hand, I will now summarize the datasets:

1. **eSCAPE-NMT**: A cleansed subset of a larger dataset specifically designed for English–German machine translation tasks.
2. **WMT 2019**: A dataset used for validation and testing in the context of the WMT shared task on Automatic Post-Editing.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its full citation.
