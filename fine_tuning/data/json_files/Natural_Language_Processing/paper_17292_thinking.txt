To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Geo-located Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) for Crowdsourced Evaluation of Urban Environments" by Demircan Tas and Rohit Priyadarshi Sanatani, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors annotated a dataset of **2500 crowdsourced reviews of public parks**, which suggests that this is a key dataset for their research.

Next, I will look into the **methodology section**, particularly **section 3.1 (Data Source)**, where the authors describe the data collection process. They mention using **Google Places** as the primary data source for gathering reviews of parks in the greater Boston area. This section provides important context about the dataset's origin and its relevance.

In **section 3.2 (Data Labelling)**, the authors detail how aspect terms and sentiment labels were manually identified and coded into the dataset. This reinforces the significance of the dataset for their analysis.

I will also check the **results section** to see if the dataset is referenced again, particularly in the context of model performance. The authors discuss the performance of their model trained on this dataset, which confirms its importance.

Finally, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. Since the dataset is based on reviews collected from Google Places, I will note that the citation for Google Places is not typically included in academic references, but I will provide a description of the dataset and its source.

The dataset I will extract is:

1. **Crowdsourced Reviews of Public Parks**: This dataset consists of 2500 reviews collected from Google Places, specifically focusing on parks in the greater Boston area. Each review includes attributes such as review text, author name, language, rating, and timestamp.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring to include the relevant details and citations for the dataset as described above. The citation for the dataset will be noted as follows:

- **Dataset Citation**: 
  > Google Places API. *Google Places*. Available at: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/overview

With this information, I will prepare the dataset entry for further processing.
