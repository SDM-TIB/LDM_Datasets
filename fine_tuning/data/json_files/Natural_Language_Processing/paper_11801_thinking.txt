To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MEMD-ABSA: A Multi-Element Multi-Domain Dataset for Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis" by Hongjie Cai et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the creation of a large-scale Multi-Element Multi-Domain dataset (MEMD) that includes nearly 20,000 review sentences and 30,000 quadruples annotated with explicit and implicit aspects and opinions. This indicates that the MEMD dataset is a primary focus of the paper.

Next, I will look into **section 2 (Multi-Element Multi-Domain ABSA Datasets)**, where the authors describe the dataset in detail. Here, they explain the data collection process and the domains covered. The dataset is constructed from five different domains: Books, Clothing, Hotel, Restaurant, and Laptop. This section provides a comprehensive overview of the dataset's structure and purpose.

In **section 2.1 (Data Collection)**, the authors specify the sources of the data for each domain:
- **Books Domain**: Data collected from the 5-core version provided by Ni et al. (2019), with 986 reviews selected.
- **Clothing Domain**: Data also from the 5-core version by Ni et al. (2019), with 928 reviews selected.
- **Restaurant Domain**: Data collected from the Boston dataset of Yelp, with 940 reviews selected.
- **Hotel Domain**: Data collected from the Boston dataset of Airbnb, with 1029 reviews selected.
- **Laptop Domain**: Data from Amazon product reviews covering six laptop brands, with a total of 18094 reviews.

Next, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

1. **Books Domain**:
   > Jianmo Ni, Jiacheng Li, and Julian McAuley. *Justifying recommendations using distantly-labeled reviews and fine-grained aspects*. In Proceedings of the 2019 conference on empirical methods in natural language processing and the 9th international joint conference on natural language processing (EMNLP-IJCNLP), pages 188–197, 2019.

2. **Clothing Domain**:
   > Jianmo Ni, Jiacheng Li, and Julian McAuley. *Justifying recommendations using distantly-labeled reviews and fine-grained aspects*. In Proceedings of the 2019 conference on empirical methods in natural language processing and the 9th international joint conference on natural language processing (EMNLP-IJCNLP), pages 188–197, 2019.

3. **Restaurant Domain**:
   > Maria Pontiki, Dimitrios Galanis, Haris Papageorgiou, Ion Androutsopoulos, Suresh Manandhar, and others. *SemEval-2016 task 5: Aspect based sentiment analysis*. In International workshop on semantic evaluation, pages 19–30, 2016.

4. **Hotel Domain**:
   > Maria Pontiki, Dimitrios Galanis, Haris Papageorgiou, Ion Androutsopoulos, Suresh Manandhar, and others. *SemEval-2016 task 5: Aspect based sentiment analysis*. In International workshop on semantic evaluation, pages 19–30, 2016.

5. **Laptop Domain**:
   > Maria Pontiki, Dimitrios Galanis, Haris Papageorgiou, Ion Androutsopoulos, Suresh Manandhar, and others. *SemEval-2016 task 5: Aspect based sentiment analysis*. In International workshop on semantic evaluation, pages 19–30, 2016.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their relevant citations from the research paper.
