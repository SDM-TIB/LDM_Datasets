To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Temporal Cross-Attention for Dynamic Embedding and Tokenization of Multimodal Electronic Health Records" by Yingbo Ma et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study and may mention the datasets used for evaluation. 

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of modeling electronic health records (EHR) and may reference specific datasets that are relevant to their work. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or studies that utilized datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly the subsection titled **3.1 DATASET**. Here, the authors describe the dataset used for their experiments, which consists of complete EHR records for major inpatient surgeries across three hospitals. They provide detailed information about the dataset, including the number of patients, types of data collected (demographics, vital signs, clinical notes, and outcomes), and the time frame of the data collection.

The dataset is described as follows:
- **EHR Dataset**: This dataset includes records for 113,953 adult patients who underwent 124,777 inpatient surgeries from 2014 to 2019. It contains demographic information, intraoperative time series data, clinical notes, and labels for postoperative complications.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. In this case, the dataset is derived from real-world EHR data, and while it may not have a formal citation like a published dataset, I will note the relevant studies or sources that describe the dataset's collection or use.

The citation for the dataset can be summarized as follows:
- **EHR Dataset**: The dataset is based on records from UF Health Gainesville, UF Health Jacksonville, and UF Health North Jacksonville, covering major inpatient surgeries from 2014 to 2019. The authors do not provide a specific citation for this dataset, but it is derived from the clinical practices at these institutions.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation or description for each dataset as required. This will allow for clear documentation of the datasets used in the research.
