To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Transpose Attack: Stealing Datasets with Bidirectional Training" by Guy Amit et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the ability of neural networks to memorize and retrieve specific samples from datasets, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, they mention using several datasets, specifically:

1. **MNIST Dataset**: A well-known dataset for handwritten digit classification, consisting of 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images.

2. **CIFAR-10 Dataset**: A dataset containing 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes, with 6,000 images per class.

3. **CelebA Dataset**: A large-scale face attributes dataset with over 200,000 celebrity images, each annotated with 40 attribute labels.

I will then check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **MNIST Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Li Deng. "The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digit Images for Machine Learning Research." IEEE Signal Processing Magazine, 29(6):141â€“142, 2012.

- For **CIFAR-10 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton, et al. "Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images." 2009.

- For **CelebA Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Ziwei Liu, Ping Luo, Xiaogang Wang, and Xiaoou Tang. "Deep Learning Face Attributes in the Wild." In Proceedings of International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), December 2015.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for easy reference and potential downstream processing.
