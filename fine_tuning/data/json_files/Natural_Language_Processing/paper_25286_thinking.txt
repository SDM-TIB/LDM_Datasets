To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Parameter Estimation for Generalized Low-Rank Matrix Sensing by Learning on Riemannian Manifolds" by Osbert Bastani, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections that discuss experiments or methodologies** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research but may not contain detailed information about datasets. Therefore, I will focus on the **introduction** and any **methodology or results sections** that might describe the datasets used.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section** or any section that discusses empirical results. If the authors refer to any datasets, I will note their names and any relevant details provided, such as the number of samples, types of data, or specific characteristics that define the dataset.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial, as proper citation is necessary for academic integrity and allows others to locate the datasets.

In this paper, I will specifically look for any references to datasets related to low-rank matrix sensing or any empirical evaluations that might involve datasets. If the authors mention datasets like "Penn Action Dataset" or "JHMDB Dataset," I will ensure to extract their full citations.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names and citations, ensuring that I have accurately represented the information as it appears in the paper.

Finally, I will summarize the findings in a clear format, making sure to include the full citations for each dataset, as this is essential for proper attribution and further research.
