To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Cross-lingual Editing in Multilingual Language Models" by Himanshu Beniwal et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments using a modified version of the **FEVER dataset**, which is a strong lead for dataset extraction.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **Datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments** section. In this paper, the authors describe their experimental setup in **section 4.2**, where they explicitly mention using a modified version of the **FEVER dataset** for their closed-book fact verification task. They provide details about the dataset, including the number of training and validation instances.

The authors state that the modified FEVER dataset consists of **104,966 training instances** and **10,444 validation instances**, with additional paraphrases created for each instance. This information is crucial for describing the dataset.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the FEVER dataset. The original citation for the FEVER dataset is:

- **FEVER Dataset**:
  > Thorne, J., Vlachos, A., Christodoulopoulos, C., & Mittal, A. (2018). *FEVER: A large-scale dataset for fact extraction and VERification*. In Proceedings of the 2018 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, Volume 1 (Long Papers), pages 809â€“819, New Orleans, Louisiana. Association for Computational Linguistics.

Since the authors used a modified version of this dataset, I will note that the original dataset is the authoritative citation.

Finally, I will compile the extracted dataset information, ensuring to include the dataset name, description, and full citation in a structured format for clarity and future reference.
