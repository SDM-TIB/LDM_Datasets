To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An Extension-based Approach for Computing and Verifying Preferences in Abstract Argumentation" by Quratul-ain Mahesara et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, results, and conclusion sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract typically provides a concise overview, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or data sources.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to see if the authors discuss any datasets used in their research or any benchmarks they reference. This section often provides context for the research and may mention specific datasets that are foundational to the study.

I will then examine the **methodology section** closely, as it usually details the experimental setup and may explicitly list the datasets used for testing or validation. I will look for any tables or figures that summarize the datasets, including their characteristics and sizes.

Following that, I will check the **results section** to see if the authors present any findings based on the datasets. This section may include performance metrics or comparisons that reference specific datasets.

Finally, I will review the **conclusion** to ensure that I capture any final mentions of datasets or any implications regarding their use in future research.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets themselves.

For example, if I find that the authors used a dataset called "Example Dataset," I will look for its citation in the references, which might look something like this:
> Author(s). *Title of the Dataset*. Year. URL or DOI if available.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation.

By following these steps, I will ensure a thorough and accurate extraction of datasets from the paper, complete with proper citations.
