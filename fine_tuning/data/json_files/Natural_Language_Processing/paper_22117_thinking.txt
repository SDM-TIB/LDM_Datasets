To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Are Models Biased on Text Without Gender-Related Language?" by Catarina Belem et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract indicates that the authors introduce a framework called **UnStereoEval (USE)** and mention repurposing prior gender bias benchmarks, which suggests that there are datasets involved.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly the parts where the authors describe how they constructed their evaluation benchmarks. In this section, they mention the creation of three datasets: **USE-5, USE-10, and USE-20**, which are generated using their framework. I will note the characteristics of these datasets, such as their size and the specific methodologies used to create them.

The authors also mention repurposing two existing datasets: **Winobias (WB)** and **Winogender (WG)**. I will ensure to extract details about these datasets, including their purpose and how they were modified for the study.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to retrieve the full citations for each dataset:

1. **USE-5, USE-10, USE-20**: These datasets are created by the authors using their UnStereoEval framework, and since they are original contributions, I will cite the paper itself:
   > Belem, C., Seshadri, P., Razeghi, Y., & Singh, S. (2024). Are Models Biased on Text Without Gender-Related Language? In Proceedings of the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR).

2. **Winobias**: The citation for this dataset is:
   > Zhao, T., Wang, Y., Yatskar, M., Ordonez, V., & Chang, K. W. (2018). Gender Bias in Coreference Resolution: Evaluation and Debiasing Methods. In Proceedings of the 2018 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, Volume 2 (Short Papers), New Orleans, Louisiana.

3. **Winogender**: The citation for this dataset is:
   > Rudinger, R., Naradowsky, J., Leonard, B., & Van Durme, B. (2018). Gender Bias in Coreference Resolution. In Proceedings of the 2018 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, Volume 2 (Short Papers), New Orleans, Louisiana.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture the datasets referenced in the paper while providing the necessary citations for future reference.
