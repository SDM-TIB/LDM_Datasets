To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Free-form Grid Structure Form Finding based on Machine Learning and Multi-objective Optimisation" by Yiping Meng and Yiming Sun, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus, but I need to look for specific datasets used in the research.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of free-form structures and the need for sophisticated optimization techniques. However, they do not explicitly mention any datasets here. I will continue to the methodology section.

In **section 2 (Machine Learning Prediction for Material Rationality)**, the authors describe the use of machine learning to predict geometric information for free-form morphology. They mention using real free-form grid structures as learning input, but they do not provide specific dataset names. I will look for any figures or tables that might indicate the datasets used.

In **section 2.2.1 (Data Transformation)**, the authors outline the data extraction and transformation process, indicating that they are working with geometric information from the Centre Pompidou-Metz model. This suggests that the geometric data from this specific structure is a dataset used in their experiments.

Next, I will check the **results section** to see if there are any additional datasets mentioned or if the authors refer to any datasets used for validation or testing purposes. They discuss the training and testing results of the Transformer model, but again, they do not specify other datasets.

Finally, I will consult the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. The Centre Pompidou-Metz model is referenced in the context of the data used for training the machine learning model, but I need to ensure that I have the correct citation for this structure.

The citation for the Centre Pompidou-Metz is:
> Shigeru Ban, "Centre Pompidou-Metz," *Centre Pompidou-Metz*, 2010.

Since the paper does not explicitly mention other datasets, I will summarize the findings based on the identified dataset.

Now, I will compile the dataset entry for the Centre Pompidou-Metz model, ensuring to include the full citation in the final output. This will provide a clear and concise reference for the dataset used in the research.
