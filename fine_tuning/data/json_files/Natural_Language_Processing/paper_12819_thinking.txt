To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Stock Market Price Prediction: A Hybrid LSTM and Sequential Self-Attention based Approach" by Karan Pardeshi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on three stock datasets: **SBIN**, **HDFCBANK**, and **BANKBARODA**. This is a strong indication that these datasets are central to the research.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In the **methodology** section, the authors describe the SBIN dataset in detail, noting that it includes historical stock data such as "open, low, high, close, and adjusted close prices and trading volume." They specify that the data spans a period of 10 years and includes 2484 observations, sourced from Yahoo Finance.

I will also check the **experiments** section to confirm that the datasets are indeed used for the experiments and to gather any additional details about their usage. The authors mention that they compare their proposed model against various algorithms using these datasets, which reinforces their importance.

Now, I will consult the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The paper cites the SBIN dataset as being sourced from Yahoo Finance, which is a common practice for stock market data. However, I need to ensure I provide a proper citation format.

1. **SBIN Dataset**: 
   - Citation: 
     > Yahoo Finance. "State Bank of India (SBIN) historical data." Available at: https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SBIN.NS/history?p=SBIN.NS

2. **HDFCBANK Dataset**: 
   - Citation: 
     > Yahoo Finance. "HDFC Bank Limited (HDFCBANK) historical data." Available at: https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/HDFCBANK.NS/history?p=HDFCBANK.NS

3. **BANKBARODA Dataset**: 
   - Citation: 
     > Yahoo Finance. "Bank of Baroda (BANKBARODA) historical data." Available at: https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BANKBARODA.NS/history?p=BANKBARODA.NS

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and that the full citations are included. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for any further processing or review.
