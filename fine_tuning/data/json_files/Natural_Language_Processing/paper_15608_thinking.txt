To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Definition of Open-Ended Learning for Goal-Conditioned Agents" by Olivier Sigaud et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a high-level overview, but specific datasets are often detailed in the methodology or experiments sections.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (if present) to see if the authors describe any datasets used for their experiments. This section typically contains explicit mentions of datasets, including their names and characteristics.

If the paper includes a **datasets section**, I will pay close attention to it, as it will likely provide detailed descriptions of each dataset, including the number of samples, types of data, and any relevant annotations.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily.

For example, if the authors mention using a dataset like "OpenAI Gym" for their experiments, I would look for the citation in the references section, which might look something like this:
> Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L., Schneider, J., et al. (2016). OpenAI Gym. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01583.

If the paper discusses datasets from other works, I will ensure to cite the original sources of those datasets as well.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, into a structured format for easy reference. This will ensure that all extracted datasets are documented correctly and comprehensively.
