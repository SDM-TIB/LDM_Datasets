To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Adversarial Attacks Against Uncertainty Quantification" by Emanuele Ledda et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental analysis sections** to look for any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, but I will need to delve deeper into the body of the paper for specific dataset mentions.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the context of their research, including applications in safety-critical domains. However, they do not explicitly mention any datasets here. I will proceed to the **experimental analysis section** where datasets are likely to be detailed.

In **section 4.1 (Experimental Setup)**, the authors mention two datasets used for their experiments:

1. **CIFAR-10**: This dataset is used for the IID (Independent and Identically Distributed) experiments. It consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class.

2. **CIFAR-100**: This dataset is used for the OOD (Out-of-Distribution) experiments. It contains 60,000 images in 100 classes, with 600 images per class.

Additionally, the authors mention using the **PASCAL VOC dataset** for semantic segmentation tasks, which is a well-known dataset in the computer vision community.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical Report, 2009.

- For **CIFAR-100**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical Report, 2009.

- For **PASCAL VOC**, the citation is:
  > M. Everingham, S. M. A. Eslami, L. Van Gool, C. K. I. Williams, J. Winn, and A. Zisserman. *The PASCAL Visual Object Classes Challenge: A Retrospective*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 111(1):98â€“136, Jan. 2015.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets referenced in the paper along with their proper citations.
