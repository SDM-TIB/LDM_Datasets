To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Video Anomaly Detection in 10 Years: A Survey and Outlook" by Moshira Abdalla et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets along with their full citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract highlights the importance of large-scale datasets in video anomaly detection, which suggests that specific datasets may be discussed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section V (Analyzing Video Anomaly Detection: A Systematic Approach)**, where the authors discuss various datasets used in the field. This section is likely to contain detailed descriptions of the datasets, including their characteristics and applications.

In **subsection A (Datasets Building and Selection)**, the authors list several datasets:

1. **Subway Dataset**: This dataset consists of two videos from a CCTV camera at an underground train station, capturing different perspectives. Anomalies include walking in incorrect directions and loitering. The dataset has a total duration of 2 hours.

2. **UCSD Pedestrian Dataset**: This dataset includes videos of pedestrian walkways with varying crowd densities. It contains two subsets (Peds1 and Peds2) with ground truth annotations indicating the presence of anomalies.

3. **Street Scene Dataset**: Comprising 46 training and 35 testing high-resolution video sequences, this dataset captures a variety of activities in a street environment, including cars and pedestrians. It contains 205 naturally occurring anomalous events.

4. **UCF-Crime Dataset**: A large-scale dataset with 1,900 videos, it includes 13 types of real-world anomalies. The dataset is meticulously curated and includes both normal and anomalous videos.

5. **CUHK Avenue Dataset**: Focused on urban anomalies, this dataset contains 30,652 frames with various challenges for VAD models.

6. **ShanghaiTech Campus Dataset**: This dataset includes over 270,000 training frames and 130 annotated abnormal events across 13 scenes.

7. **XD-Violence Dataset**: A large-scale dataset with 4,754 untrimmed videos, it focuses on weakly supervised violence detection.

8. **NWPU Campus Dataset**: This dataset includes 305 training videos and 242 testing videos, capturing a wide range of normal and abnormal activities.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access the datasets.

The citations I will look for include:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
