To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Novel Way of Identifying Cyber Predators" by Dan Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the research involves a novel approach for Sexual Predator Identification (SPI) and mentions the use of datasets for training and evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors reference the PAN2012 dataset, which is crucial for their experiments. They mention that PAN initiated the Sexual Predator Identification (SPI) Task in 2012 and that this dataset contains a significant amount of chat data relevant to their research.

In the **experiments section**, I will look for specific details about the datasets used. The authors explicitly mention two datasets:

1. **PAN2012 Dataset**: This dataset is described as containing 66,927 chat conversations in the training set and 155,128 in the test set, with a specific focus on identifying sexual predators among users.

2. **IMDB Large Movie Review Dataset**: This dataset is used to evaluate the performance of their model, consisting of 50,000 binary labeled reviews.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **PAN2012 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > G. Inches and F. Crestani, “Overview of the international sexual predator identification competition at PAN-2012.” in CLEF (Online Working Notes/Labs/Workshop), 2012.

- For the **IMDB Large Movie Review Dataset**, the citation is:
  > A. L. Maas et al, “Learning word vectors for sentiment analysis,” in Proceedings of the 49th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies-Volume 1, 2011.

Having gathered this information, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented and properly cited for future reference.
