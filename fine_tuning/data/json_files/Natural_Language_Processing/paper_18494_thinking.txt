To extract datasets from the research paper titled "LaneGraph2Seq: Lane Topology Extraction with Language Model via Vertex-Edge Encoding and Connectivity Enhancement" by Renyuan Peng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors validate their method on two prominent datasets, which suggests that specific names will be provided later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically looking for any explicit mentions of datasets. In this paper, the authors mention two datasets: **nuScenes** and **Argoverse 2**. I will note down the details provided about these datasets, including their characteristics and how they are used in the experiments.

In the **experiments section**, the authors describe the **nuScenes** dataset as comprising 1000 sequences, divided into training, validation, and test sets, with specific frame rates and camera configurations. They also mention the **Argoverse 2** dataset, which consists of 1000 sequences collected from various cities, highlighting its larger volume compared to nuScenes.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **nuScenes**, the citation is:
  > Caesar, H.; Bankiti, V.; Lang, A. H.; Vora, S.; Liong, V. E.; Xu, Q.; Krishnan, A.; Pan, Y.; Baldan, G.; and Beijbom, O. (2020). *nuscenes: A multimodal dataset for autonomous driving*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR).

- For **Argoverse 2**, the citation is:
  > Wilson, B.; Qi, W.; Agarwal, T.; Lambert, J.; Singh, J.; Khandelwal, S.; Pan, B.; Kumar, R.; Hartnett, A.; Pontes, J. K.; et al. (2021). *Argoverse 2: Next generation datasets for self-driving perception and forecasting*. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS).

With these citations in hand, I will compile the dataset information, ensuring that I include the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations as required.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring that all necessary details are accurately represented for further processing or review.
