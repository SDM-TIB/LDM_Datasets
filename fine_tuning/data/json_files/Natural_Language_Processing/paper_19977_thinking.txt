To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Provable Filter for Real-world Graph Clustering" by Xuanting Xie et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors validate their approach through extensive experiments on both homophilic and heterophilic graphs, which suggests that specific datasets are used.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, they mention benchmark datasets commonly used for graph clustering tasks, specifically identifying:

1. **Homophilic Graph Datasets**: 
   - **Cora**: A dataset with 2,708 nodes and 5,429 edges.
   - **CiteSeer**: A dataset with 3,327 nodes and 4,732 edges.
   - **Pubmed**: A dataset with 19,717 nodes and 44,327 edges.
   - **Amazon Photo (AMAP)**: A dataset with 7,600 nodes and 119,081 edges.
   - **USA Air-Traffic (UAT)**: A dataset with 1,190 nodes and 13,599 edges.

2. **Heterophilic Graph Datasets**:
   - **Cornell**: A dataset with 183 nodes and 298 edges.
   - **Wisconsin**: A dataset with 251 nodes and 515 edges.
   - **Washington**: A dataset with 230 nodes and 786 edges.
   - **Chameleon**: A dataset with 2,277 nodes and 31,371 edges.
   - **Squirrel**: A dataset with 5,201 nodes and 217,073 edges.
   - **Roman-empire**: A dataset with 22,662 nodes and 32,927 edges.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations related to these datasets. However, the paper does not provide specific citations for each dataset used, which is common in many research papers. Instead, I will note that the datasets are standard benchmarks in the field of graph clustering.

Now, I will compile the dataset information, ensuring to include the names and characteristics of each dataset as well as their respective citations where applicable. Since the paper does not provide specific citations for the datasets, I will acknowledge that they are widely recognized datasets in the research community.

Finally, I will summarize the findings in a structured format that clearly presents the datasets used in the research, along with their relevant details.
