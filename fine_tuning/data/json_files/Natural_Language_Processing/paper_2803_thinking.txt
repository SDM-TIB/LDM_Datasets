To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Blind signal decomposition of various word embeddings based on join and individual variance explained (JIVE)" by Yikai Wang and Weijian Li, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental design sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted an empirical study on various word embeddings, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experimental Design)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. They mention two datasets for sentiment analysis:

1. **Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST)**: This dataset contains movie reviews crawled from Rotten Tomatoes, with a training set of 8,539 sentences and a testing set of 1,101 sentences. The vocabulary size is 18,193, and it has five sentiment categories ranging from 0 (most negative) to 4 (most positive).

2. **Twitter Sentiment Analysis Dataset**: This dataset consists of 50,248 tweets, half of which were used for training and the other half for testing. The vocabulary size is 24,604, and it is a binary classification problem with two sentiments: positive and negative.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **Stanford Sentiment Treebank**, the citation is:
  > Richard Socher, Alex Perelygin, Jean Wu, Jason Chuang, Christopher D Manning, Andrew Ng, and Christopher Potts. *Recursive deep models for semantic compositionality over a sentiment treebank*. In Proceedings of the 2013 conference on empirical methods in natural language processing, pages 1631â€“1642, 2013.

- For the **Twitter Sentiment Analysis Dataset**, the citation is:
  > The Twitter sentiment analysis dataset is not explicitly cited in the paper, but it is commonly referenced as the dataset used in various sentiment analysis tasks. A typical citation for a similar dataset might be:
  > Go, A., Bhayani, R., & Huang, L. (2009). *Twitter sentiment classification using distant supervision*. CS224N Project Report, Stanford University.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
