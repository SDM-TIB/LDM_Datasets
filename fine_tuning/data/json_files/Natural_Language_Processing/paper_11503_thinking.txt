To extract datasets from the research paper titled "PanoOcc: Unified Occupancy Representation for Camera-based 3D Panoptic Segmentation" by Yuqi Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on the **nuScenes dataset** and the **Occ3D benchmark**, indicating that these datasets are crucial for their research.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used:

1. **nuScenes Dataset**: The paper describes this dataset as containing 1000 scenes, with a breakdown of 700 for training, 150 for validation, and 150 for testing. It includes RGB images from six cameras and point cloud data from a LiDAR sensor, annotated for object detection and segmentation tasks.

2. **Occ3D-nuScenes**: This dataset is mentioned as containing 700 training scenes and 150 validation scenes, with specific details about the occupancy scope and voxel size.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **nuScenes dataset**, the citation is:
  > Holger Caesar, Varun Bankiti, Alex H Lang, Sourabh Vora, Venice Erin Liong, Qiang Xu, Anush Krishnan, Yu Pan, Giancarlo Baldan, and Oscar Beijbom. *nuScenes: A multi-modal dataset for autonomous driving*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pages 11621â€“11631, 2020.

- For the **Occ3D-nuScenes dataset**, the citation is:
  > Xiaoyu Tian, Tao Jiang, Longfei Yun, Yue Wang, Yilun Wang, and Hang Zhao. *Occ3D: A large-scale 3D occupancy prediction benchmark for autonomous driving*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2304.14365, 2023.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will prepare to format this information according to the required structure for downstream processing or review.
