To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards a Foundation Model for Partial Differential Equations: Multi-Operator Learning and Extrapolation" by Jingmin Sun et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study and may mention specific datasets used for training or evaluation. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets, while the methodology section typically details how the datasets were utilized in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors describe their experimental design. This section is likely to contain specific information about the datasets used, including their characteristics, sizes, and any relevant parameters. The authors mention creating a dataset containing **25.6K PDEs** with **20 initial conditions** each, leading to a total of **512K systems**. This is a crucial dataset that I need to document.

I will also look for any references to existing datasets or benchmarks that the authors may have used or compared against. This information is often found in the **references section** or within the text where the authors discuss related work.

After identifying the datasets, I will gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. For example, if the authors refer to a specific dataset like the **PDEBench**, I will need to find the original source of that dataset and include its citation.

Hereâ€™s a summary of the datasets I have identified so far:

1. **PDE Dataset**: The authors created a dataset containing **25.6K PDEs** with **20 initial conditions** each, resulting in **512K systems**. This dataset is central to their experiments.

2. **PDEBench**: The authors mention using PDEBench for solving various types of equations. I will need to find the citation for this dataset.

Now, I will compile the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **PDE Dataset**, since it is created by the authors, I will cite it as follows:
  > Sun, J., Liu, Y., Zhang, Z., & Schaeffer, H. (2023). *Towards a Foundation Model for Partial Differential Equations: Multi-Operator Learning and Extrapolation*. [Dataset description].

- For **PDEBench**, I will look up the original paper that introduced this dataset and provide the citation accordingly.

Finally, I will ensure that I have accurately documented each dataset's details and citations in a structured format for easy reference. This will include the dataset name, description, and full citation, ensuring that all information is clear and accessible for future use.
