To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Exploring 3D-Aware Lifespan Face Aging via Disentangled Shape-Texture Representations" by Rui Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of face aging and the importance of modeling both shape and texture. However, they do not mention specific datasets here, so I will move on to the **experiments section**.

In **section 4 (Experiments)**, the authors explicitly mention the dataset used for training their model. They state that they used the **pruned FFHQ-Aging dataset**, which contains 70,000 images labeled in 10 age groups. They further specify that this dataset was pruned to 28,701 images dedicated to lifespan face synthesis, divided into six discrete age groups.

Next, I will look for the **full citation** of the dataset in the **References section**. The authors reference the FFHQ-Aging dataset in the context of their experiments, and I will need to find the original source of this dataset to provide a complete citation.

Upon reviewing the references, I find the citation for the FFHQ-Aging dataset:

- For **FFHQ-Aging Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Roy Or-El et al., “Lifespan Age Transformation Synthesis,” in ECCV, 2020.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the dataset information:

1. **FFHQ-Aging Dataset**: This dataset contains 28,701 images labeled across six age groups: {0-2, 3-6, 7-9, 15-19, 30-39, 50-69}. It is used for training the model to synthesize lifespan face aging.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for review or further processing, ensuring that I include the full citation for the dataset as it is crucial for proper attribution in research.
