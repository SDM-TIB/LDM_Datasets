To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Words, Subwords, and Morphemes: What Really Matters in the Surprisal-Reading Time Relationship?" by Sathvik Nair and Philip Resnik, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions testing surprisal estimates against reading time data, which suggests that there are datasets involved. I will look for specific names of datasets in these sections.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly the **corpora** subsection (2.2.1), where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention two specific datasets:

1. **Dundee Corpus**: This dataset is referenced as containing averaged eye movement data from English-speaking participants reading newspaper articles. I will note the details provided about the dataset, including its purpose and the nature of the data collected.

2. **Natural Stories Corpus**: This dataset consists of sentences from narrative texts edited for psycholinguistic analysis. The authors provide information about the participants and the reading times recorded, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's context.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset. The citations are essential for proper attribution and further exploration of the datasets:

- For the **Dundee Corpus**, the citation is:
  > Alan Kennedy, Robin Hill, and JoÃ«l Pynte. *The Dundee Corpus*. In Proceedings of the 12th European Conference on Eye Movement.

- For the **Natural Stories Corpus**, the citation is:
  > Richard Futrell, Edward Gibson, and Roger P Levy. *The Natural Stories Corpus*. In Proceedings of the Eleventh International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC 2018), Miyazaki, Japan. European Language Resources Association (ELRA).

Now that I have the names and citations for the datasets, I will compile this information into a structured format that highlights each dataset's name, description, and full citation. This will ensure that the datasets are clearly documented and easily accessible for future reference or analysis.
