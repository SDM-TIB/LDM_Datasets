To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Weakly Supervised Semantic Parsing with Execution-based Spurious Program Filtering" by Kang-il Lee et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract mentions empirical evaluations on two datasets: **Natural Language Visual Reasoning (NLVR)** and **WIKITABLEQUESTIONS (WTQ)**. This indicates that these datasets are crucial to the research and likely to be described in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will look into **section 2 (Background)**, where the authors introduce the datasets. Here, they provide specific details about each dataset:

1. **NLVR (Natural Language Visual Reasoning)**: This dataset consists of 3,163 unique training examples, each comprising one utterance and four world-denotation pairs. The denotations are Boolean values indicating the truth of the utterance in the given world. The dataset also includes development, public test, and hidden test sets.

2. **WTQ (WIKITABLEQUESTIONS)**: This dataset is designed for table semantic parsing and includes 11,321 training examples and 2,831 development examples. It features complex queries and variations in natural language, with denotations that can be values from table cells or results from applying functions to those values.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **NLVR**, the citation is:
  > Alane Suhr, Mike Lewis, James Yeh, and Yoav Artzi. *A corpus of natural language for visual reasoning*. In Proceedings of the 55th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 2: Short Papers), pages 217–223, Vancouver, Canada, 2017.

- For **WTQ**, the citation is:
  > Panupong Pasupat and Percy Liang. *Compositional semantic parsing on semi-structured tables*. In Proceedings of the 53rd Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics and the 7th International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing (Volume 1: Long Papers), pages 1470–1480, Beijing, China, 2015.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
