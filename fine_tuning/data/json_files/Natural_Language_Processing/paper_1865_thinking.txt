To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CoSDA-ML: Multi-Lingual Code-Switching Data Augmentation for Zero-Shot Cross-Lingual NLP" by Libo Qin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses a data augmentation framework for generating multi-lingual code-switching data, which suggests that there may be datasets involved in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this paper, the authors mention conducting experiments on five tasks with 19 languages, which indicates that multiple datasets are likely involved.

In **section 4 (Experiments)**, I will look for specific mentions of datasets. The authors refer to several datasets used for different tasks:

1. **XNLI Dataset**: This dataset is used for natural language inference and covers 15 languages. It is crucial to note the specific citation for this dataset.

2. **OpeNER Datasets**: These datasets are used for sentiment classification, specifically for English and Spanish, as well as the MultiBooked datasets for Catalan and Basque.

3. **MLDoc Dataset**: This dataset is utilized for document classification and includes a balanced subset of the Reuters corpus covering 8 languages.

4. **Multilingual WOZ 2.0 Dataset**: This dataset is used for dialogue state tracking and includes German and Italian languages.

5. **Cross-lingual Spoken Language Understanding Dataset**: This dataset contains English, Spanish, and Thai, and is used for spoken language understanding tasks.

After identifying these datasets, I will consult the **References section** to retrieve the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **XNLI Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Alexis Conneau, Ruty Rinott, Guillaume Lample, Adina Williams, Samuel Bowman, Holger Schwenk, and Veselin Stoyanov. *XNLI: Evaluating cross-lingual sentence representations*. In Proceedings of the 2018 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), 2018.

- For the **OpeNER Datasets**, the citation is:

- For the **Cross-lingual Spoken Language Understanding Dataset**, the citation is:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
