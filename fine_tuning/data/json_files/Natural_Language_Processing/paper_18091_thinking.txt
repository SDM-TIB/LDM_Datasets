To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Comprehensive OOD Detection Improvements" by Anish Lakkapragada et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, results, and conclusion sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract mentions the use of the **OpenOODv1.5 benchmark framework**, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Data and Evaluation Setup)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for evaluation. They mention four in-distribution (ID) datasets: **CIFAR-10**, **CIFAR-100**, **ImageNet-1K**, and **ImageNet-200**. I will note these datasets and look for their descriptions and any relevant details.

In the same section, the authors also refer to various out-of-distribution (OOD) datasets that are split into NearOOD and FarOOD categories. They mention specific datasets such as **MNIST**, **SVHN**, **Textures**, and **Places365** for NearOOD, and **iNaturalist**, **OpenImage-O**, and others for FarOOD. I will compile these datasets as well.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to retrieve full citations for each dataset:

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
