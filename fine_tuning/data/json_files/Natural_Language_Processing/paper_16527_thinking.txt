To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Odor-Based Molecular Communications: State-of-the-Art, Vision, Challenges, and Frontier Directions" by Dilara Aktas et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a high-level overview, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the research, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments and results sections**. These sections typically detail the datasets used for analysis and experimentation. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

In this paper, the authors discuss various applications and implications of odor-based molecular communication, but I need to identify specific datasets. I will also check for any **tables or figures** that might summarize datasets or provide additional context.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for the datasets used in the research.

If the paper references existing datasets, I will ensure to note their original sources. If the authors have created new datasets, I will look for any accompanying publications or documentation that provide the necessary citation information.

Once I have gathered all the relevant information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for easy reference and further analysis.
