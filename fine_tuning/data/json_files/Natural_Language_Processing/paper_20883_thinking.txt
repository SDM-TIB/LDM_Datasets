To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "The Invalsi Benchmark: measuring Language Models Mathematical and Language understanding in Italian" by Andrea Esuli and Giovanni Puccetti, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors present two new benchmarks for evaluating language models in Italian, specifically for mathematical and language understanding. This suggests that there are datasets to be extracted.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section, where the authors elaborate on the need for these benchmarks. They mention the two datasets: **Invalsi MATH** and **Invalsi ITA**, which are designed to assess language models' performance on math reasoning and language understanding, respectively. This confirms the presence of two datasets.

I will then look into **section 3 (Dataset Description)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of both datasets:

1. **Invalsi MATH**: This dataset consists of 422 questions designed to evaluate mathematical understanding. The questions are categorized into four types: Multiple Choice, True-False, Fill the Gap, and Number. The dataset is derived from public tests used in the Italian school system.

2. **Invalsi ITA**: This dataset focuses on language understanding and includes a variety of question types, such as Extraction, Multiple Choice, Binary, and Miscellaneous. The complexity of the questions is higher compared to the math dataset, and it also draws from public tests administered in the Italian education system.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. However, the datasets are based on existing public tests rather than standalone publications. Therefore, I will cite the original sources of the Invalsi tests as follows:

- For **Invalsi MATH**, the citation is:
  > Bolondi, G., & Cascella, C. (2017). Somministrazione delle prove invalsi dal 2009 al 2015: un patrimonio d’informazioni tra evidenze psicometriche e didattiche. In I dati INVALSI: uno strumento per la ricerca. Franco Angeli, Milano.

- For **Invalsi ITA**, the citation is the same as it is also derived from the Invalsi tests:
  > Bolondi, G., & Cascella, C. (2017). Somministrazione delle prove invalsi dal 2009 al 2015: un patrimonio d’informazioni tra evidenze psicometriche e didattiche. In I dati INVALSI: uno strumento per la ricerca. Franco Angeli, Milano.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will prepare to compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
