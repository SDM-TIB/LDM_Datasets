To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Preference Tuning For Toxicity Mitigation Generalizes Across Languages" by Xiaochen Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the use of "multilingual toxic prompts from RTP-LX benchmark," indicating that this is a dataset relevant to the study.

Next, I will examine **section 3 (Cross-lingual Toxicity Mitigation)**, where the authors describe their methodology. They specifically mention using the **RTP-LX benchmark** for evaluating multilingual toxicity, which consists of around 1,000 multilingual prompts. This section provides a clear description of the dataset's purpose and its origin.

In addition, I will look for any other datasets referenced in the **related work** or **experiments sections**. The authors refer to the **Jigsaw dataset** for training a linear probe for toxicity classification, which is another dataset that needs to be documented.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset from the **References section** of the paper:

1. **RTP-LX Benchmark**:
   - Citation: 
     > de Wynter, A., Watts, I., Altıntoprak, N. E., Wongsangaroonsri, T., Zhang, M., Farra, N., Baur, L., Claudet, S., Gajdusek, P., Gören, C., et al. (2024). RTP-LX: Can LLMs evaluate toxicity in multilingual scenarios? arXiv preprint arXiv:2404.14397.

2. **Jigsaw Dataset**:
   - Citation:
     > cjadams, J., Sorensen, J., Elliott, J., Dixon, L., McDonald, M., nithum, & Cukierski, W. (2017). Toxic comment classification challenge.

After identifying the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their respective citations.
