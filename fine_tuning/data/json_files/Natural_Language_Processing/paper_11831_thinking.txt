To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Performance Analysis of Empirical Open-Circuit Voltage Modeling in Lithium Ion Batteries, Part-1: Performance Measures" by P. Pillai, J. Nguyen, and B. Balasingam, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the importance of the open circuit voltage to state of charge (OCV-SOC) characteristic but does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine the **methodology section** for any references to data collection methods or specific datasets used in the experiments. The authors mention empirical modeling approaches and standards for OCV-SOC characterization, which may imply the use of datasets, but I need to find specific names or references.

I will also check the **results and discussion sections** to see if the authors refer to any datasets used for their analysis or comparisons. If they mention specific datasets or provide data points, I will note them down.

After identifying potential datasets, I will look at the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to ensure that the datasets can be accessed or referenced by others.

If the paper discusses specific datasets used in previous studies, I will ensure to extract those citations as well. For example, if they refer to datasets from other works, I will include those citations in my extraction.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and ease of use.

Finally, I will ensure that each dataset entry includes a clear description of its purpose and relevance to the research, along with the full citation for each dataset, as this is very important for academic integrity and future reference.
