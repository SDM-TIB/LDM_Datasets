To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Boosting Order-Preserving and Transferability for Neural Architecture Search: a Joint Architecture Refined Search and Fine-tuning Approach" by Beichen Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention the importance of Neural Architecture Search (NAS) and refer to various datasets indirectly, but I need to find explicit mentions of datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they explicitly mention three datasets:

1. **ImageNet-1K**: A large-scale dataset containing 1,000 classes and over one million images for training, which is crucial for evaluating the performance of the proposed method.

2. **ImageNet-100**: A subset of ImageNet-1K, containing 100 classes and 1300 images per class for training, used to evaluate order-preserving ability and performance of supernet transferring.

3. **CIFAR-100**: Another dataset mentioned for supplementary experiments, which contains 100 classes with 600 images per class.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **ImageNet-1K**, the citation is:
  > Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, and Li Fei-Fei. *ImageNet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 248â€“255, 2009.

- For **CIFAR-100**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton, et al. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. 2009.

The authors do not provide a specific citation for ImageNet-100, as it is a subset of ImageNet-1K, so the citation for ImageNet-1K suffices for referencing ImageNet-100.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented and properly cited.
