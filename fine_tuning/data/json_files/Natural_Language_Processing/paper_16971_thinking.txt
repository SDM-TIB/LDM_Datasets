To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Enhancing Robustness of Foundation Model Representations under Provenance-related Distribution Shifts" by Xiruo Ding et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the examination of models under distribution shifts, which suggests that datasets are involved, particularly in the context of clinical data.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention:

1. **SHAC Dataset**: This dataset consists of electronic health record notes annotated for social determinants of health (SDoH). It includes clinical notes from chronic pain patients at the University of Washington Medical Center and discharge notes from the MIMIC-III database. The goal is to classify sections of patient history for signs of drug abuse.

2. **Hate Speech Detection Datasets**: The authors describe two datasets used for hate speech detection:
   - The first dataset is a dynamically generated dataset (DynGEN) created through perturbation on existing datasets.
   - The second dataset (WSF) is collected from a white supremacist forum, containing posts labeled for hate speech.

I will then verify the details of these datasets in the **Appendix B**, which provides additional information about the SHAC and Hate Speech datasets, including their sizes and characteristics.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset from the **References section**:

- For the **SHAC Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Kevin Lybarger, Mari Ostendorf, and Meliha Yetisgen. *Annotating social determinants of health using active learning, and characterizing determinants using neural event extraction*. Journal of Biomedical Informatics, 113:103631, 2021.

- For the **MIMIC-III Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Alistair E.W. Johnson, Tom J. Pollard, Lu Shen, et al. *MIMIC-III, a freely accessible critical care database*. Scientific Data, 3(1):1–9, 2016.

- For the **DynGEN Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Bertie Vidgen and Leon Derczynski. *Directions in abusive language training data, a systematic review: Garbage in, garbage out*. PLOS ONE, 15(12):e0243300, 2020.

- For the **WSF Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Ona de Gibert, Naiara Perez, Aitor García-Pablos, and Montse Cuadros. *Hate speech dataset from a white supremacy forum*. In Proceedings of the 2nd Workshop on Abusive Language Online (ALW2), pages 11–20, Brussels, Belgium, October 2018.

After compiling this information, I will ensure that I have accurately documented each dataset along with its full citation, ready for further processing or review.
