To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MEP: Multiple Kernel Learning Enhancing Relative Positional Encoding Length Extrapolation" by Weiguo Gao, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that empirical evaluations were conducted across diverse datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly the subsection titled **Dataset and Implementation Description**. Here, the author explicitly lists the datasets used for evaluation:

1. **OpenWebText2**: Described as a large, filtered corpus of text documents obtained from URLs found in Reddit submissions, containing 17,103,059 documents and totaling 65.86GB of uncompressed text.

2. **GitHub**: An AI-powered development platform that supports various programming languages and allows developers to create, store, and manage code.

3. **ArXiv**: A repository of scientific papers across multiple fields, including mathematics, physics, and computer science.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with sources for further exploration.

For **OpenWebText2**, the citation is:
> Gao, L., Biderman, S., Black, S., Golding, L., Hoppe, T., Foster, C., Phang, J., He, H., Thite, A., Nabeshima, N., et al. (2020). *The pile: An 800gb dataset of diverse text for language modeling*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2101.00027.

For **GitHub**, there is no specific citation provided in the paper, but it is generally referenced as a widely known platform.

For **ArXiv**, the citation is:
> Chen, M., Tworek, J., Jun, H., Yuan, Q., Pinto, H. P. d. O., Kaplan, J., Edwards, H., Burda, Y., Joseph, N., Brockman, G., et al. (2021). *Evaluating large language models trained on code*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2107.03374.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and ease of use.

In summary, I will ensure that each dataset is clearly described, and I will include the full citations to maintain academic integrity and provide proper references for future research.
