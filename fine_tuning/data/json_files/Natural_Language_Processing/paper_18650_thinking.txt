To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Active Learning for Graphs with Noisy Structures" by Hongliang Chi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the effectiveness of the proposed method across various types of noisy graphs, which suggests that datasets may be involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors discuss the challenges of active learning in the context of noisy graphs. They mention the need for labeled data and refer to several datasets used in their experiments. This indicates that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

In the **experiments section**, I will look for a subsection that explicitly lists the datasets used for evaluation. The authors typically provide a summary of the datasets, including their characteristics and the context in which they were used. 

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors evaluate their method on the following datasets:

1. **Cora**: A citation network dataset commonly used for node classification tasks. It contains 2,708 nodes and 5,429 edges, with 7 classes of documents.

2. **Citeseer**: Another citation network dataset, which consists of 3,327 nodes and 4,732 edges, categorized into 6 classes.

3. **Pubmed**: A dataset derived from PubMed abstracts, containing 19,717 nodes and 44,338 edges, classified into 3 categories.

4. **Amazon-Photo**: A dataset from Amazon product reviews, specifically for photo-related products, used for multi-class classification.

5. **Amazon-Computers**: Similar to Amazon-Photo, this dataset focuses on computer-related products and is used for multi-class classification tasks.

6. **Coauthor-CS**: A co-authorship network in the computer science domain, which includes 18,333 nodes and 81,900 edges, categorized into 3 classes.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations typically include the original papers or sources from which the datasets were derived. 

For example, the citations for the datasets are as follows:

- **Cora**:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or analysis. This process ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their sources as presented in the research paper.
