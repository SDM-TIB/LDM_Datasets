To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Toon3D: Seeing Cartoons from a New Perspective" by Ethan Weber et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to look for any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the creation of a dataset called the **Toon3D Dataset**, which is a strong indication that there is a dataset to extract.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Toon3D Labeler and Dataset)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the Toon3D Dataset. They state that it consists of **12 cartoon scenes (10 TV shows, 1 movie)** and **78 labeled images**. This section will likely contain the specifics I need for the dataset entry.

In this section, the authors list the cartoon scenes included in the dataset, which are:

1. **Avatar House**
2. **Bobâ€™s Burgers**
3. **BoJack Room**
4. **Family Guy Dining**
5. **Family Guy House**
6. **Krusty Krab**
7. **Magic School Bus**
8. **Mystery Machine**
9. **Planet Express**
10. **Simpsons House**
11. **Rick and Morty**
12. **Spirited Away**

The authors also provide statistics about the dataset, including the number of images and labeled points for each scene. This information is crucial for a comprehensive dataset entry.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Toon3D Dataset. However, since the dataset is created by the authors themselves, it may not have a separate citation in the references. Instead, I will note the authors and the title of the paper as the citation for the dataset.

The citation for the Toon3D Dataset will be:
> Weber, E., Peterlinz, R., Mathur, R., Warburg, F., Efros, A. A., & Kanazawa, A. (2023). *Toon3D: Seeing Cartoons from a New Perspective*. 

Finally, I will compile the extracted information into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and citation. This will ensure that I have a complete and accurate representation of the dataset as described in the paper.
