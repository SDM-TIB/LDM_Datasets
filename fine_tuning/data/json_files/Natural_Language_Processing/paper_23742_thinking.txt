To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The BIGGEN BENCH: A Principled Benchmark for Fine-grained Evaluation of Language Models with Language Models" by Seungone Kim et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the introduction of the **BIGGEN BENCH**, which is a benchmark designed to evaluate language models across various capabilities. This indicates that the benchmark itself may be a dataset or a collection of tasks that can be considered a dataset.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **methodology or experiments sections**. In the introduction, the authors discuss evaluating 103 frontier language models using the BIGGEN BENCH, which suggests that the benchmark includes a structured dataset for evaluation.

In the **section detailing the BIGGEN BENCH**, I will look for any explicit lists or descriptions of datasets used in the evaluation. The paper outlines that the benchmark evaluates nine core capabilities across 77 tasks and 765 instances. This implies that the benchmark is structured around a dataset that includes these tasks and instances.

I will also check the **appendices** for any additional details about the datasets, including how they were constructed or any specific datasets referenced. The authors mention that the instances were crafted through a human-in-the-loop approach, which may indicate the use of existing datasets or the creation of new ones.

Now, I will compile the information I find into a list of datasets, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. 

1. **BIGGEN BENCH**: This is the primary dataset introduced in the paper, which includes 765 instances across 77 tasks designed to evaluate language models. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Seungone Kim, Juyoung Suk, Ji Yong Cho, Shayne Longpre, Chaeeun Kim, Dongkeun Yoon, Guijin Son, Yejin Cho, Sheikh Shafayat, Jinheon Baek, Sue Hyun Park, Hyeonbin Hwang, Jinkyung Jo, Hyowon Cho, Haebin Shin, Seongyun Lee, Hanseok Oh, Noah Lee, Namgyu Ho, Se June Joo, Miyoung Ko, Yoonjoo Lee, Hyungjoo Chae, Seonghyeon Ye, Bill Yuchen Lin, Jamin Shin, Joel Jang, Sean Welleck, Graham Neubig, Moontae Lee, Kyungjae Lee, Minjoon Seo. *The BIGGEN BENCH: A Principled Benchmark for Fine-grained Evaluation of Language Models with Language Models*. 2023.

2. **Evaluation Results Dataset**: This dataset contains the evaluation results of the 103 language models assessed using the BIGGEN BENCH. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Seungone Kim, Juyoung Suk, Ji Yong Cho, Shayne Longpre, Chaeeun Kim, Dongkeun Yoon, Guijin Son, Yejin Cho, Sheikh Shafayat, Jinheon Baek, Sue Hyun Park, Hyeonbin Hwang, Jinkyung Jo, Hyowon Cho, Haebin Shin, Seongyun Lee, Hanseok Oh, Noah Lee, Namgyu Ho, Se June Joo, Miyoung Ko, Yoonjoo Lee, Hyungjoo Chae, Seonghyeon Ye, Bill Yuchen Lin, Jamin Shin, Joel Jang, Sean Welleck, Graham Neubig, Moontae Lee, Kyungjae Lee, Minjoon Seo. *The BIGGEN BENCH: A Principled Benchmark for Fine-grained Evaluation of Language Models with Language Models*. 2023.

After gathering this information, I will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations, ready for any further processing or review.
