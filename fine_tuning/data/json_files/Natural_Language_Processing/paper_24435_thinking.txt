To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DemoRank: Selecting Effective Demonstrations for Large Language Models in Ranking Task" by Wenhan Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the application of large language models (LLMs) in passage ranking tasks and mention that they conduct experiments on various ranking datasets. This indicates that datasets are indeed used, but I need to find their specific names.

Next, I will look into **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically detail the datasets used for training and evaluation. Here, they explicitly list the datasets utilized in their experiments:

1. **HotpotQA**: A dataset for multi-hop question answering, which requires reasoning over multiple documents to answer questions.
   - Citation: Yang, Z., Wang, Y., Yih, W. T., He, X., & Gao, J. (2018). *HotpotQA: A dataset for diverse, explainable multi-hop question answering*. In EMNLP, pages 2369–2380. Association for Computational Linguistics.

2. **NQ (Natural Questions)**: A benchmark dataset for question answering that includes real user queries and corresponding answers.
   - Citation: Kwiatkowski, T., Palomaki, J., Redfield, O., Collins, M., Parikh, A. P., Alberti, C., Epstein, D., Polosukhin, I., Lee, K., Toutanova, K., Jones, L., Kelcey, M., Chang, M. W., Uszkoreit, J., Le, Q., & Petrov, S. (2019). *Natural questions: A benchmark for question answering research*. Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics, 7, 452–466.

3. **FEVER**: A dataset for fact extraction and verification, which involves determining the veracity of claims based on provided articles.
   - Citation: Thorne, J., Vlachos, A., Christodoulopoulos, C., & Mittal, A. (2018). *FEVER: A large-scale dataset for fact extraction and verification*. In NAACL-HLT, pages 809–819. Association for Computational Linguistics.

4. **MS MARCO**: A dataset designed for machine reading comprehension, containing human-generated questions and passages.
   - Citation: Nguyen, T., Rosenberg, M., Song, X., Gao, J., Tiwary, S., Majumder, R., & Deng, L. (2016). *MS MARCO: A human generated machine reading comprehension dataset*. In Proceedings of the Workshop on Cognitive Computation, pages 1773. CEUR-WS.org.

5. **TREC DL19 and TREC DL20**: Datasets used in the TREC Deep Learning tracks for evaluating passage ranking systems.
   - Citation for DL19: Craswell, N., Mitra, B., Yilmaz, E., & Campos, D. (2020). *Overview of the TREC 2019 deep learning track*. CoRR, abs/2003.07820.
   - Citation for DL20: Craswell, N., Mitra, B., Yilmaz, E., Campos, D., & Voorhees, E. M. (2020). *Overview of the TREC 2020 deep learning track*. In TREC, volume 1266 of NIST Special Publication. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).

After identifying these datasets, I will ensure to compile their full citations accurately as they are crucial for proper referencing in any subsequent work.

Finally, I will summarize the findings in a structured format that highlights each dataset along with its citation, ensuring clarity and completeness for future reference or analysis.
