To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Real-Time Dynamic Robot-Assisted Hand-Object Interaction via Motion Primitives" by Mingqi Yuan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, and the introduction often discusses prior work and datasets used in related studies.

Next, I will look for specific sections that might detail the datasets used, such as **section II (RGB-Based 3D Hand Pose Sensing)** and **section III (Motion Primitives Model)**. In these sections, the authors describe their methodology and may reference datasets used for training or validation.

In **section III (Motion Primitives Model)**, the authors mention that they collected a dataset of hand motion sequences for training their model. They state that they collected 2000 consecutive frames of RGB image data, which were used to extract 3D coordinates of hand joints. This indicates that they have created a self-collected dataset specifically for their experiments.

I will also check the **experimental setup** in section IV, where they describe the tasks performed and the data collected during experiments. This section may provide additional context about the dataset's structure and purpose.

Now, I will compile the details of the dataset:

1. **Self-Collected Hand Motion Dataset**: This dataset consists of 2000 frames of RGB images collected during the ring-wearing task. The dataset includes 3D coordinates of 21 hand joints extracted from these images, and it was used to train the motion primitives model (MPM).

Next, I will look at the **References section** to find any citations related to the datasets mentioned. However, since the dataset is self-collected, it may not have a formal citation like publicly available datasets. Instead, I will note that it is a proprietary dataset created by the authors for their specific research.

Finally, I will summarize the dataset information, ensuring to include the context in which it was used and any relevant details that would be useful for someone looking to understand or replicate the study.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring that the full citation for the dataset is clear and complete, even if it is self-referenced.
