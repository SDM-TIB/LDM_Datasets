To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Characterization of Neural Networks Automatically Mapped on Automotive-grade Microcontrollers" by Giulia Crocioni et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract discusses the implementation of neural networks in automotive applications, which suggests that datasets may be involved in the experiments.

Next, I will examine **section 4 (Case Studies)**, as it is likely to contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the experiments. In **section 4.1**, the authors mention using the **SynCAN dataset** for the intrusion detection system. This dataset is described as a synthetic dataset created to benchmark and evaluate different CAN intrusion detection systems. I will note the details provided about the dataset, including its composition of normal and abnormal traffic signals and the types of attacks included.

In **section 5.1**, the authors refer to a dataset made available by **NASA Ames Prognostics Center of Excellence** for the capacity estimation of Li-Ion batteries. This dataset is described in terms of the operational profiles and features measured during the experiments. I will extract the relevant details about this dataset as well.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

1. For the **SynCAN dataset**, the citation is:
   > M. Hanselmann, T. Strauss, K. Dormann, and H. Ulmer. *CANet: An Unsupervised Intrusion Detection System for High Dimensional CAN Bus Data*. IEEE Access 8 (2020), 58194â€“58205. https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2982544

2. For the **NASA battery dataset**, the citation is:
   > B. Saha and K. Goebel. *Battery Data Set, NASA Ames Prognostics Data Repository*. Dataset number 5, http://ti.arc.nasa.gov/project/prognostic-datarepository, Accessed on 10 October 2019.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited. This will allow for a comprehensive understanding of the datasets used in the research and their relevance to the experiments conducted in the paper.
