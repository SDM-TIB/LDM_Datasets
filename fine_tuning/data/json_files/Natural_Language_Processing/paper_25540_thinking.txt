To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Unmasking Social Bots: How Confident Are We?" by James Giroux et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the challenges of bot detection and the need for uncertainty quantification, which may hint at the datasets used for training and evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to see if the authors mention specific datasets used in their research. The introduction discusses various bot detection tools and methods, but I need to look for explicit mentions of datasets.

In the **methods section**, the authors describe their approach using two specific feature sets: **BLOC** and **Botometer**. I will note that these are not datasets in the traditional sense but rather frameworks or tools used to extract features from social media accounts. However, I will need to check if they reference any specific datasets that were used to train or evaluate their models.

In the **results section**, the authors present performance metrics for their models, but they do not explicitly mention any datasets. I will need to look at the **references section** to find any citations related to the BLOC framework and Botometer, as these may lead to the original datasets or studies that utilized them.

Now, I will compile the full citations for the relevant frameworks mentioned:

1. **BLOC**: The citation for the BLOC framework is:
   > Nwala, A. C., Flammini, A., & Menczer, F. (2023). A language framework for modeling social media account behavior. *EPJ Data Science*, 12, 33. DOI: 10.1140/epjds/s13688-023-00410-9.

2. **Botometer**: The citation for Botometer is:
   > Yang, K.-C., Ferrara, E., & Menczer, F. (2022). Botometer 101: Social bot practicum for computational social scientists. *Journal of Computational Social Science*, 5, 1511â€“1528. DOI: 10.1007/s42001-022-00177-5.

Since the paper does not provide specific datasets but rather discusses the use of these frameworks, I will note that the datasets used for training and evaluation are likely derived from the features extracted by these tools.

Finally, I will summarize my findings, ensuring that I have accurately captured the relevant datasets and their citations for future reference or processing.
