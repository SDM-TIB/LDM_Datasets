To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Performance Bounds for Velocity Estimation with Large Antenna Arrays" by Caterina Giovannetti et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and conclusion** sections to see if any datasets are explicitly referenced. The abstract discusses joint communication and sensing (JCS) and mentions performance bounds for velocity estimation, but it does not specify any datasets. 

Next, I will examine the **main body of the paper**, particularly the **numerical results section** and any sections that discuss experiments or simulations. In this case, the authors present numerical results based on theoretical analysis rather than empirical data derived from specific datasets. They mention parameters such as the number of antennas, carrier frequency, and signal-to-noise ratio, but they do not refer to any external datasets.

Since the paper does not explicitly mention any datasets used for validation or experimentation, I will check the **references section** to see if any cited works include datasets. The references primarily consist of theoretical papers and reviews on related topics, but they do not indicate the use of specific datasets.

After reviewing the entire paper, I conclude that there are no datasets explicitly mentioned or utilized in the research. Therefore, I will not be able to provide full citations for datasets as none exist in this context.

In summary, I will document that no datasets were found in the paper "Performance Bounds for Velocity Estimation with Large Antenna Arrays" by Caterina Giovannetti et al. and provide a note indicating the absence of datasets in the research.
