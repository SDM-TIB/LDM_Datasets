To extract datasets from the research paper titled "AI in Software Engineering: Case Studies and Prospects" by Lei Wang, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and case study sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses two case studies: IBM Watson and Google AlphaGo, but does not mention specific datasets. I will need to look deeper into the case studies for any references to datasets.

In **section 3 (AI techniques in Software Development)**, the paper describes the workings of IBM Watson and Google AlphaGo. I will focus on the details provided in the case studies to identify any datasets used in their development or training processes.

For **IBM Watson**, the text mentions that it uses a "mass knowledge storage from all over the world" and references a dataset called the "urban dictionary," which was used for language processing but later removed due to inappropriate content. This indicates that there is a dataset involved, but I need to find the full citation for it.

For **Google AlphaGo**, the paper states that it learned from "30 million moves" from historical games played by professional players. This suggests that there is a dataset related to Go games, but again, I need to find the original source or citation for this dataset.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. For the **urban dictionary**, while the paper does not provide a formal citation, I can reference it as:
   > Urban Dictionary. (n.d.). *Urban Dictionary*. [Online]. Available: https://www.urbandictionary.com/

2. For the **30 million moves dataset** used by AlphaGo, I will refer to the original paper published by DeepMind:
   > Silver, D., Schrittwieser, J., Simonyan, K., Antonoglou, I., Huang, A., Guez, A., Hubert, T., Baker, L., Lai, M., Bolton, A., Chen, Y., Lillicrap, T., Hui, F., Sifre, L., van den Driessche, G., Graepel, T., & Hassabis, D. (2017). *Mastering the game of Go without human knowledge*. Nature, 550, 354-359. doi:10.1038/nature24270

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research paper along with their proper citations.
