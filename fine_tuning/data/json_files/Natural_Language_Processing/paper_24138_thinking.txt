To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Dialogue Action Tokens: Steering Language Models in Goal-Directed Dialogue with a Multi-Turn Planner" by Kenneth Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their method on the **Sotopia platform** and **Harmbench**, suggesting that these may be datasets or evaluation frameworks.

Next, I will look for specific sections that discuss datasets in detail. In this paper, the **experiments** section is likely to contain explicit mentions of datasets used for evaluation. I will focus on the **social capability experiment** and the **multi-turn red teaming experiment** sections, as these are where the authors describe their experimental setups.

In the **social capability experiment**, the authors mention using **Sotopia**, which is described as an open-ended environment that simulates multi-turn conversations between language model agents. I will note that **Sotopia** is a dataset or platform used for evaluating social capabilities.

In the **multi-turn red teaming experiment**, the authors refer to **Harmbench**, which is used to benchmark their proposed multi-turn red teaming setting. This indicates that **Harmbench** is another dataset relevant to their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. **Sotopia**: The citation is:
   > Zhou, X., Zhu, H., Mathur, L., Zhang, R., Yu, H., Qi, Z., Morency, L.-P., Bisk, Y., Fried, D., Neubig, G., et al. *Sotopia: Interactive evaluation for social intelligence in language agents*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2310.11667, 2023.

2. **Harmbench**: The citation is:
   > Mazeika, M., Phan, L., Yin, X., Zou, A., Wang, Z., Mu, N., Sakhaee, E., Li, N., Basart, S., Li, B., et al. *Harmbench: A standardized evaluation framework for automated red teaming and robust refusal*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2402.04249, 2024.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

- **Sotopia**: An open-ended environment for simulating multi-turn conversations between language model agents, used to evaluate social capabilities.
- **Harmbench**: A benchmark for evaluating multi-turn red teaming scenarios, focusing on eliciting harmful responses from language models.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
