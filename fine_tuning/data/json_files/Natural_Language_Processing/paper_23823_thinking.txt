To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Convex ordering for stochastic control: the swing contracts case" by Gilles Pag√®s and Christian Yeo, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for validation or experimentation.

Next, I will examine the **experiments or results section** of the paper, as this is typically where datasets are explicitly detailed. I will look for any tables, figures, or descriptions that outline the datasets used in the study. If the authors refer to specific datasets, I will note their names and any relevant details such as the number of samples, features, or any unique characteristics.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** of the paper to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily. I will ensure that I capture the authors, title, publication venue, and year of publication for each dataset.

If the paper mentions any datasets that are not publicly available or are proprietary, I will note that as well, indicating the limitations regarding access to those datasets.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their full citations, into a structured format for clarity and ease of use.

Finally, I will ensure that all extracted information is accurate and complete, ready for any further processing or review.
