To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Focus on Hiders: Exploring Hidden Threats for Enhancing Adversarial Training" by Qian Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and while it may not explicitly mention datasets, it sets the context for the experiments. The introduction often discusses the datasets used in the study, so I will pay close attention to this section.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention that they conduct extensive experiments on the **CIFAR-10**, **CIFAR-100**, and **SVHN** datasets. This is a clear indication that these datasets are central to their research.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors describe their experimental setup and confirm that they utilize the **CIFAR-10**, **CIFAR-100**, and **SVHN** datasets for their evaluations.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for future researchers who may want to access these datasets.

1. **CIFAR-10 Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton, et al. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. 2009.

2. **CIFAR-100 Dataset**: The citation is the same as CIFAR-10 since it is a variant of the CIFAR-10 dataset:
   > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton, et al. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. 2009.

3. **SVHN Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Yuval Netzer, Tao Wang, Adam Coates, Alessandro Bissacco, Bo Wu, and Andrew Y Ng. *Reading digits in natural images with unsupervised feature learning*. 2011.

After gathering the dataset names and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and future reference. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their proper citations.
