To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The Silent Curriculum: How Does LLM Monoculture Shape Educational Content and Its Accessibility?" by Aman Priyanshu and Supriti Vijay, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract hints at an exploration of biases and cultural representation, which may suggest the use of specific datasets.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the concept of "LLM monoculture" and its implications, but I need to look for specific datasets used in their experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly the part titled "Generating an Occupational-Ethnic Bias Benchmark." Here, the authors mention that they prompted the LLMs to draw inspiration from the **WinoBias dataset** to create an occupational-ethnic bias dataset. This indicates that the WinoBias dataset is a key dataset used in their research.

I will also check the **results section** where they discuss the findings from their experiments. They mention the generation of children's stories and the self-annotation of ethnic groups based on names and locations extracted from these stories. However, they do not introduce any new datasets beyond the WinoBias dataset.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citation for the WinoBias dataset. The relevant citation is:

- For **WinoBias dataset**:
  > Jieyu Zhao, Tianlu Wang, Mark Yatskar, Vicente Ordonez, and Kai-Wei Chang. *Gender bias in coreference resolution: Evaluation and debiasing methods*. In Proceedings of the 2018 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, pages 15â€“20, 2018.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets explicitly, I will compile the information I have gathered about the WinoBias dataset.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry based on the information extracted, ensuring that the full citation is included for clarity and proper attribution.
