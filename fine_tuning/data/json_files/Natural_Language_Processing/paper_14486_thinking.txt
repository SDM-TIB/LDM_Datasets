To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Empirical Study of PEFT techniques for Crop Type Segmentation" by Mohamad Hasan Zahweh et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant details, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study involves crop monitoring and mentions a dataset called the **Lebanese Wheat dataset**, which is a strong lead.

Next, I will focus on the **datasets section** (section 3.2) where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention two datasets:

1. **Beqaa-Lebanon Dataset**: This dataset was prepared in-house and consists of approximately 2,000 wheat parcels per year from 2016 to 2019, with a total annotated area of 170 km². The year 2020 is used as a test set with a surface area of 981 km².

2. **Munich 480 Dataset**: This dataset covers an area of 102 km x 42 km in Munich, Germany, consisting of 30 images per year split into 48 x 48 tiles, covering 27 different crop classes.

I will then verify the details of these datasets by cross-referencing them with the **experiments section** to confirm their usage in the study. The authors indeed use both datasets for their experiments, which solidifies their relevance.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For the **Beqaa-Lebanon Dataset**, since it is an in-house dataset, it may not have a formal citation. However, I will note that it is described in detail in the paper itself.

- For the **Munich 480 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Rußwurm, M.; Körner, M. *Multi-temporal land cover classification with sequential recurrent encoders*. ISPRS International Journal of Geo-Information 2018, 7, 129.

Now, I will compile the extracted information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the Munich 480 dataset and note the details of the Lebanese Wheat dataset as described in the paper.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for further processing or review.
