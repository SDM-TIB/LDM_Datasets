To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Incremental Object-Based Novelty Detection with Feedback Loop" by Simone Caldarella et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the problem of novelty detection and mentions the use of a benchmark for evaluating their method, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe their experimental setup. Here, they mention relying on three datasets: **VOC**, **COCO**, and **OpenImages**. I will take note of the details provided for each dataset, including their sizes and the number of classes.

1. **VOC Dataset**: The authors state that it contains over 10,000 images and 25,000 annotated objects across 20 classes. This dataset is commonly used for object detection tasks.

2. **COCO Dataset**: This dataset is described as having 123,000 images and nearly 900,000 instances across 80 classes, including 20 classes from VOC. It is a well-known dataset in the field of computer vision.

3. **OpenImages Dataset**: The authors mention that this is the largest collection with 16 million bounding boxes for 600 classes on 1.9 million images, which includes all VOC and 60 COCO classes.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for these datasets are as follows:

- For **VOC Dataset**:
  > Everingham, M., Van Gool, L., Williams, C.K.I., Winn, J., Zisserman, A. (2012). *The PASCAL Visual Object Classes Challenge 2012 (VOC2012) Results*.

- For **COCO Dataset**:
  > Lin, T.Y., Maire, M., Belongie, S., Bourdev, L., Girshick, R., Hays, J., Perona, P., Ramanan, D., Zitnick, C.L., DollÃ¡r, P. (2014). *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*.

- For **OpenImages Dataset**:
  > Kuznetsova, A., Rom, H., Alldrin, N., Uijlings, J., Krasin, I., Pont-Tuset, J., Kamali, S., Popov, S., Malloci, M., Kolesnikov, A., Duerig, T., Ferrari, V. (2020). *The Open Images Dataset V4: Unified Image Classification, Object Detection, and Visual Relationship Detection at Scale*.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this into a structured format for further processing or review.
