To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Depth Information Assisted Collaborative Mutual Promotion Network for Single Image Dehazing" by Yafei Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of a dual-task collaborative framework for image dehazing, which suggests that datasets may be involved in the experiments. 

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for training and evaluation. In this section, they mention using the **Indoor Training Set (ITS)** and **Outdoor Training Set (OTS)** from the RESIDE dataset for training, and the **Synthetic Objective Test Set (SOTS)** for evaluation. This is a clear indication of the datasets utilized in their experiments.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The RESIDE dataset is referenced in the paper, and I will locate the corresponding citation. 

The citation for the RESIDE dataset is:
> Boyi Li, Wenqi Ren, Dengpan Fu, Dacheng Tao, Dan Feng, Wenjun Zeng, and Zhangyang Wang. *Benchmarking single-image dehazing and beyond*. IEEE Transactions on Image Processing, 28(1):492â€“505, 2018.

With this information, I can summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **Indoor Training Set (ITS)**: Part of the RESIDE dataset used for training the model.
2. **Outdoor Training Set (OTS)**: Another part of the RESIDE dataset used for training.
3. **Synthetic Objective Test Set (SOTS)**: Used for evaluation, containing 500 indoor and 500 outdoor hazy images.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
