To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Test-time Adaptation of Text Line Recognition Models" by Debapriya Tula et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors perform rigorous evaluation on several benchmark datasets, which indicates that multiple datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they mention five benchmark datasets:

1. **ICDAR2015-HTR**: This dataset consists of handwritten historical documents in English, with line-level annotations. The authors use the entire dataset of 433 images for testing.

2. **GoodNotes Handwriting Kollection (GNHK)**: This dataset contains handwritten English text sourced from various regions, with a total of 687 images used for evaluation. The authors mention that they convert word-level annotations to line annotations.

3. **IAM Handwriting Database**: This dataset consists of English handwritten text from 1539 pages written by 657 unique writers. The authors use the entire dataset for evaluation.

4. **CVL Database**: This dataset includes English handwritten text from 1598 pages written by 310 writers. The authors utilize lines from both train and test splits for their evaluation.

5. **KOHTD**: This dataset consists of exam papers filled by students in Kazakh and Russian languages, containing a total of 1891 images. The authors mention that it has word-level annotations for each page.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their respective citations.
