To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Continual Pre-Training for Cross-Lingual LLM Adaptation: Enhancing Japanese Language Capabilities" by Kazuki Fujii et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on a large Japanese web corpus, which suggests that there may be specific datasets referenced later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments and results sections**, particularly looking for any explicit mentions of datasets used for evaluation. In **Table 2**, the authors list several Japanese datasets used for evaluation tasks, which include:

1. **JCQA (JCommonsenseQA)**: A Japanese question-answering dataset designed to assess common sense knowledge.
2. **JEMHQA (JEMHopQA)**: A Japanese open-ended question-answering dataset that evaluates multi-hop reasoning.
3. **NIILC**: A dataset for developing question-answering systems in Japanese.
4. **JSQuAD**: A Japanese machine reading comprehension dataset derived from the SQuAD dataset.
5. **XL-Sum**: A dataset for automatic summarization created from BBC News articles.
6. **MGSM**: A dataset of arithmetic word problems translated into Japanese.

In addition to these, I will also check **Table 3** for English datasets mentioned in the paper, which include:

1. **OBQA (OpenBookQA)**: A dataset for question answering.
2. **TrQA (TriviaQA)**: Another question-answering dataset.
3. **SQuAD2**: A well-known dataset for machine comprehension.
4. **GSM8K**: A dataset for arithmetic reasoning.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations for the datasets mentioned in the paper are as follows:

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
