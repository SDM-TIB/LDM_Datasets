To extract datasets from the research paper titled "FastPoseCNN: Real-Time Monocular Category-Level Pose and Size Estimation Framework," I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the introduction of two novel datasets called **CAMERA** and **REAL** in 2019, which indicates that these are the primary datasets used in the research.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **Datasets** section or any relevant subsections that provide detailed descriptions of these datasets. In this paper, the datasets are discussed in the **Literature Review** section, specifically in subsection 2.2, where the authors explain the characteristics of the CAMERA and REAL datasets. 

1. **CAMERA Dataset**: This is described as an extensive synthetic dataset containing realistic backgrounds with rendered 3D models in workplace-related environments. It is designed for category-level 6D pose and size estimation.

2. **REAL Dataset**: This dataset is smaller and consists of real images with the same object categories and similar backgrounds as the CAMERA dataset. It is intended to complement the CAMERA dataset by providing real-world examples.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the original papers that introduced these datasets. The relevant citation for the CAMERA and REAL datasets is:

- For **CAMERA and REAL datasets**:
  > He Wang, Srinath Sridhar, Jingwei Huang, Julien Valentin, Shuran Song, and Leonidas J Guibas. *Normalized Object Coordinate Space for Category-Level 6D Object Pose and Size Estimation*. In The IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 6 2019.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or processing. This includes ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation, which is crucial for proper attribution in any subsequent work.
