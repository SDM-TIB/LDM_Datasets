To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Workflow Optimization for Parallel Split Learning" by Joana Tirana et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the research, which may include references to datasets used.

Next, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. These sections typically detail the experimental setup and the datasets used for evaluation. I will pay close attention to any tables, figures, or descriptions that might list datasets or provide insights into their characteristics.

In this paper, the authors mention using **CIFAR-10** as a dataset for their training tasks. I will note down the details provided about this dataset, including its relevance to the experiments conducted.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. For CIFAR-10, I will look for the original paper or source that describes the dataset comprehensively.

The citation for **CIFAR-10** is:
> Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton. "Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images." 2009.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines the dataset's name, description, and citation.

In summary, I will ensure that I have accurately extracted the dataset information from the paper, focusing on the following steps:
1. Review the abstract and introduction for mentions of datasets.
2. Examine the methodology and experiments sections for detailed descriptions of datasets.
3. Retrieve full citations from the references for each identified dataset.
4. Compile the dataset information clearly and concisely.

This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details regarding the datasets used in the research.
