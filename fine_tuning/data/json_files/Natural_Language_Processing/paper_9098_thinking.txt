To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Probing Taxonomic and Thematic Embeddings for Taxonomic Information" by Filip KlubiË‡cka and John D. Kelleher, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's goals and methods, which may hint at the datasets used.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Probing Dataset Construction)**, where the authors discuss the construction of a new taxonomic probing task. Here, they mention that the dataset is derived from **WordNet**, which is a well-known lexical database. The authors state that the dataset contains hypernym-hyponym pairs, which is crucial information for identifying the dataset.

In this section, they specify that the dataset consists of **493,494 instances**, with a training set of **443,494 instances** and a test set of **50,000 instances**. This detailed description confirms that this is a primary dataset used in their experiments.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for WordNet, as it is the source of the dataset. The citation for WordNet is:

- **WordNet**: 
  > Christiane Fellbaum. *WordNet: An Electronic Lexical Database*. MIT Press, Cambridge, MA, 1998.

Additionally, I will look for any other datasets mentioned in the paper. In the **experimental setup** section, the authors refer to using **thematic and taxonomic SGNS and GloVe embeddings**, but these are not datasets in themselves; rather, they are methods of generating embeddings from the WordNet dataset.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citation for WordNet as it is the primary dataset referenced in the paper.

In summary, the key dataset extracted from the paper is the hypernym-hyponym pairs derived from WordNet, and I will document it with the appropriate citation.
