To extract datasets from the research paper titled "PEaCE: A Chemistry-Oriented Dataset for Optical Character Recognition on Scientific Documents" by Nan Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract introduces the **PEaCE dataset**, which is the primary focus of the paper, indicating that it contains both synthetic and real-world records for OCR tasks.

Next, I will look into **section 3 (PEaCE Dataset)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the dataset. They mention that PEaCE consists of:

1. **Synthetic Records**: This includes 1 million images of printed English text, 100,000 images of numerical artifacts, and 100,000 images of pseudo-chemical equations. Each of these records is accompanied by LATEX ground-truth labels.

2. **Real-World Test Set**: This part of the dataset contains 319 images extracted from actual scientific documents, specifically focusing on chemistry papers. These images also come with LATEX ground-truth strings.

The authors emphasize that PEaCE is unique as it integrates both printed English and scientific text, which is crucial for training OCR models effectively.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The PEaCE dataset itself is the main dataset discussed, and it is important to cite it properly. The authors do not provide a separate citation for the synthetic components since they are generated from existing datasets (arXiv and PubMed), but I will note that the dataset is available at the provided GitHub link.

The citation for the PEaCE dataset is:
> Nan Zhang, Connor Heaton, Sean Timothy Okonsky, Prasenjit Mitra, Hilal Ezgi Toraman. *PEaCE: A Chemistry-Oriented Dataset for Optical Character Recognition on Scientific Documents*. Available at: https://github.com/ZN1010/PEaCE.

Next, I will summarize the datasets extracted:

1. **PEaCE Dataset**: Contains synthetic records (1M printed English images, 100k numerical artifacts, 100k pseudo-chemical equations) and a real-world test set (319 images from chemistry papers).

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that highlights the datasets and their citations, ensuring that all relevant details are included for future reference or processing.
