To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Network Contention-Aware Cluster Scheduling with Reinforcement Learning" by Junyeol Ryu and Jeongyoon Eo, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the challenges of network contention in GPU clusters but does not mention specific datasets. The introduction provides context about distributed deep learning but also lacks specific dataset references.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments and evaluation sections**. These sections typically contain details about the datasets used for testing the proposed methods. I will look for any tables, figures, or descriptions that might indicate the datasets utilized in their experiments.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention using job traces for evaluation, specifically referencing **Microsoft’s Philly trace** and **Alibaba’s PAI trace**. These traces are crucial for understanding the performance of their scheduling policies.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the references section:

1. **Microsoft's Philly trace**: The citation is:
   > M. Jeon, S. Venkataraman, A. Phanishayee, J. Qian, W. Xiao, and F. Yang. "Analysis of Large-Scale Multi-Tenant GPU Clusters for DNN Training Workloads." In 2019 USENIX Annual Technical Conference (USENIX ATC 19), 2019, pp. 947–960.

2. **Alibaba’s PAI trace**: The citation is:
   > Q. Weng, W. Xiao, Y. Yu, W. Wang, C. Wang, J. He, Y. Li, L. Zhang, W. Lin, and Y. Ding. "MLaaS in the Wild: Workload Analysis and Scheduling in Large-Scale Heterogeneous GPU Clusters." In 19th USENIX Symposium on Networked Systems Design and Implementation (NSDI 22), 2022, pp. 945–960.

After identifying the datasets and their citations, I will summarize the findings in a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation for future reference.

This process ensures that I accurately capture the datasets used in the research and provide proper attribution to the original sources.
