To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Robust Internal Representations for Domain Generalization" by Mohammad Rostami, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often highlights key datasets used in the study.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments and results sections**, as these typically contain detailed information about the datasets used for evaluation. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

In the **experiments section**, I will pay close attention to any subsections that discuss the datasets. If the paper includes a dedicated section for datasets, I will extract the relevant details from there. I will note down the names of the datasets, their descriptions, and any specific metrics or characteristics mentioned.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like "Penn Action Dataset," I will look for its citation in the references. I will ensure to capture the authors, title, publication venue, and year of publication.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.

Finally, I will organize the extracted information clearly and concisely, ready for any further processing or presentation.
