To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Qibo: A Large Language Model for Traditional Chinese Medicine" by Heyi Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their full citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and method sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors constructed a professional corpus in the field of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), which suggests that multiple datasets may be involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Method)**, where the authors describe the construction of the Qibo model. Here, they mention various types of data used for pre-training, including:

1. **Medical books**: This dataset consists of 38.1 million entries.
2. **TCM books**: This dataset contains 40.6 million entries.
3. **Yicang**: A dataset with 317 million entries.
4. **Subclass medical professionals**: This dataset has 49.8 million entries.
5. **Other Ancient Books**: This dataset includes 165 million entries.
6. **Encyclopedia of TCM**: This dataset consists of 563 million entries.
7. **TCM Reading Comprehension**: This dataset has 40.2 million entries.
8. **TCM Syndrome Differentiation**: This dataset contains 50.4 million entries.
9. **TCM Prescription**: This dataset has 13.5 million entries.

The authors provide a detailed breakdown of the datasets used for pre-training, which is crucial for understanding the scope of their research.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. However, the paper does not provide specific citations for each dataset directly. Instead, I will look for references to the original sources of these datasets mentioned in the text. 

For example, the authors refer to various TCM textbooks and encyclopedias as sources for their datasets. I will need to identify specific works that are commonly recognized in the field of TCM to provide authoritative citations. 

After gathering the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation for the source material where applicable.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that all citations are accurate and complete.
