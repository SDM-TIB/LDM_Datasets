To extract datasets from the research paper titled "EEG-DG: A Multi-Source Domain Generalization Framework for Motor Imagery EEG Classification" by Xiao-Cong Zhong et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** sections to get an overview of the research context and any datasets that may be mentioned. The abstract indicates that experiments were conducted on "BCI competition datasets IV-2a and IV-2b," which suggests that these datasets are crucial for the study.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** to find detailed descriptions of the datasets used. In the paper, the authors provide specific information about the two datasets:

1. **BCI Competition IV Dataset 2a**: This dataset consists of EEG data recorded from 9 subjects performing four different motor imagery tasks. It includes 22 channels recorded at a sampling rate of 250 Hz, with each subject participating in two sessions.

2. **BCI Competition IV Dataset 2b**: This dataset contains EEG data from the same 9 subjects but recorded from only 3 channels (C3, Cz, and C4) at the same sampling rate. It includes five sessions, with the first three sessions being labeled and the last two serving as target domains.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the BCI Competition datasets are typically provided in the context of their original publications. 

The citations I will include are:

- For **BCI Competition IV Dataset 2a**:
  > He, H., Wu, D., & Lu, B.-L. (2015). *Transfer Learning for EEG-based Brain-Computer Interfaces: A Euclidean Space Data Alignment Approach*. IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering, 62(12), 2990-2999.

- For **BCI Competition IV Dataset 2b**:
  > He, H., Wu, D., & Lu, B.-L. (2015). *Transfer Learning for EEG-based Brain-Computer Interfaces: A Euclidean Space Data Alignment Approach*. IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering, 62(12), 2990-2999.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations, ensuring that I maintain clarity and accuracy in the documentation process. This will allow for proper referencing and validation of the datasets used in the research.
