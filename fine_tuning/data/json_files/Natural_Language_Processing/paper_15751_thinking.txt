To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The Equivalence of Dynamic and Strategic Stability Under Regularized Learning in Games" by Victor Boone and Panayotis Mertikopoulos, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and it may mention specific datasets used for experiments or simulations.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments or results section** of the paper, as this is where authors typically describe the datasets they used for their analyses. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and any relevant characteristics.

If the paper includes a **datasets section**, I will pay close attention to it, as it will likely provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the study. I will note down the names of the datasets, their purposes, and any specific details that the authors provide.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** of the paper to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily. I will ensure that I capture the authors, title, publication venue, and year for each dataset.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, along with proper references for further exploration.

Finally, I will organize the extracted information clearly and concisely, ready for any required output format or further processing.
