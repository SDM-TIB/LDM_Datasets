To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fairness-Optimized Synthetic EHR Generation for Arbitrary Downstream Predictive Tasks" by Mirza Farhan Bin Tarek et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the datasets referenced. The abstract mentions that the authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their proposed pipeline across various downstream tasks and two different EHR datasets. This indicates that there are specific datasets used in their experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly the **data description** subsection, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they identify two datasets:

1. **MIMIC-III Dataset**: This dataset is sourced from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC) and contains anonymized electronic health records (EHRs) from patients admitted to the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. The authors specify that they used the ICU stay dataset, which includes 46,520 patients with various disease phenotype labels.

2. **PIC (Pediatric Intensive Care) Dataset**: This dataset is described as a pediatric-specific database comprising information related to children admitted to critical care units at the Childrenâ€™s Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine. The dataset contains 13,449 patients and includes similar structures to the MIMIC-III dataset.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For the **MIMIC-III dataset**, the citation is:
  > Johnson, A. E. W., Pollard, T. J., Shen, L., Lehman, L.-W. H., Feng, M., Ghassemi, M., Moody, B., Szolovits, P., Celi, L. A., & Mark, R. G. (2016). MIMIC-III, a freely accessible critical care database. *Scientific Data*, 3(1), 1-9.

- For the **PIC dataset**, the citation is:
  > Zeng, X., Yu, G., Lu, Y., Tan, L., Wu, X., Shi, S., Duan, H., Shu, Q., & Li, H. (2020). PIC, a pediatric-specific intensive care database. *Scientific Data*, 7(1), 14.

Now that I have the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use. This process ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets referenced in the paper along with their proper citations, which is crucial for any subsequent analysis or reporting.
