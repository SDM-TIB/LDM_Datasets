To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Another Look at the Linear Probability Model and Nonlinear Index Models" by Kaicheng Chen, Robert S. Martin, and Jeffrey M. Wooldridge, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus but does not explicitly mention datasets. The introduction may contain references to datasets used in the analysis, so I will pay close attention to any specific mentions.

Next, I will look for sections that typically contain dataset information, such as **section 4 (Experiments)** or any section explicitly labeled as **Datasets**. In this paper, the authors discuss simulations and empirical studies, which may involve specific datasets or data sources.

In the **experiments section**, the authors mention using a dataset related to mortgage lending decisions, specifically referencing a study by Hunter and Walker (1996). This indicates that there is a dataset involved in their empirical analysis.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset mentioned. The relevant citation for the dataset used in the mortgage lending analysis is:

- For the dataset from Hunter and Walker (1996):
  > Hunter, W. C. and Walker, M. B. (1996). *The cultural affinity hypothesis and mortgage lending decisions*. The Journal of Real Estate Finance and Economics, 13:57â€“70.

After identifying the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the dataset details, including its context and any relevant characteristics mentioned in the paper.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format for clarity and future reference, ensuring that the full citation is included for proper attribution.
