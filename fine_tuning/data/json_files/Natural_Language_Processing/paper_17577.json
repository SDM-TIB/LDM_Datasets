It is organized into benchmarks targeting specific vulnerabilities, including benign applications with vulnerabilities, malicious applications designed to exploit these vulnerabilities, and secure applications that are immune to such exploitation. The benchmarks include practical instructions for building and executing the applications, allowing for empirical verification of the vulnerabilities and their corresponding exploits.",
