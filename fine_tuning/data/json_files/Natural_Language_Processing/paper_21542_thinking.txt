To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Countering Mainstream Bias via End-to-End Adaptive Local Learning" by Jinhao Pan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that extensive experiments were conducted, which suggests that datasets were used. I will look for any specific dataset names or references in these sections.

Next, I will move to **section 4 (Debiasing Experiments)**, where the authors provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in their experiments. In this section, they mention three public datasets:

1. **ML1M**: This dataset is referenced as a widely used dataset in recommendation systems. I will need to find the full citation for this dataset in the references section.

2. **Yelp**: The authors indicate that they used the Yelp dataset, which is also a common dataset for recommendation tasks. Again, I will look for the full citation in the references.

3. **Amazon CDs and Vinyl**: This dataset is mentioned as another dataset used in their experiments. I will ensure to find its citation as well.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper for the complete citations. The citations I need to extract are:

- For **ML1M**, the citation is:
  > Harper, F.M., Konstan, J.A. "The movielens datasets: History and context." ACM Transactions on Interactive Intelligent Systems (TIIS) 5(4), 1–19, 2015.

- For **Yelp**, the citation is:
  > Yelp dataset (2021), https://www.yelp.com/dataset.

- For **Amazon CDs and Vinyl**, the citation is:
  > Ni, J., Li, J., McAuley, J. "Justifying recommendations using distantly-labeled reviews and fine-grained aspects." In Proceedings of the 2019 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing and the 9th International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing (EMNLP-IJCNLP), pp. 188–197, 2019.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research along with their proper citations.
