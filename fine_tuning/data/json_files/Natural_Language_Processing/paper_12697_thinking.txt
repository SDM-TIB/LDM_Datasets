To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Many-to-Many Spoken Language Translation via Unified Speech and Text Representation Learning with Unit-to-Unit Translation" by Minsu Kim et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often highlights the datasets used for experiments.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of multilingual speech synthesis and mention the need for datasets that support their proposed method. However, I need to look for specific dataset names and details.

Next, I will focus on the **Multilingual Dataset section**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used for training their model. They mention two key datasets:

1. **VoxPopuli**: This dataset is collected from European Parliament event recordings and contains aligned speech-to-speech data in 15 source languages and their corresponding translations into 15 target languages. The total duration of this dataset is approximately 11.2k hours.

2. **mTEDx**: This dataset is collected from the TEDx program and provides speech-to-text translation data. The authors utilize a subset of this dataset, which contains translations into English from several languages, and the total duration used is about 0.7k hours.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **VoxPopuli**, the citation is:
  > Wang, C., Riviere, M., Lee, A., Wu, A., Talnikar, C., Haziza, D., Williamson, M., Pino, J., and Dupoux, E. (2021). Voxpopuli: A large-scale multilingual speech corpus for representation learning, semi-supervised learning and interpretation. arXiv preprint arXiv:2101.00390.

- For **mTEDx**, the citation is:
  > Salesky, E., Wiesner, M., Bremerman, J., Cattoni, R., Negri, M., Turchi, M., Oard, D. W., and Post, M. (2021). The multilingual TEDx corpus for speech recognition and translation. arXiv preprint arXiv:2102.01757.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
