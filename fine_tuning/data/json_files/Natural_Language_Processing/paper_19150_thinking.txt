To extract datasets from the research paper titled "RAGIC: Risk-Aware Generative Adversarial Model for Stock Interval Construction" by Jingyi Gu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of RAGIC across "globally recognized broad-based indices," which suggests that specific datasets related to stock indices may be used.

Next, I will look into **section VI (Model Evaluation)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. They state that they chose five broad-based stock indices worldwide, which include:

1. **Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA)**: A well-known stock market index that tracks 30 significant publicly traded companies in the U.S.
2. **S&P 500 (SPX)**: Composed of 500 of the largest publicly traded companies in the U.S.
3. **NASDAQ 100**: Contains 101 of the largest non-financial companies listed on the NASDAQ stock exchange.
4. **Deutscher Aktienindex (DAX)**: Measures the performance of 40 major German blue-chip companies.
5. **Nikkei 225**: Consists of 225 companies from various sectors in Japan.

The paper also mentions that the historical daily stock indices and their corresponding volatility indices are publicly available on Yahoo Finance and Investing.com, which indicates that these datasets are accessible for further research.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. However, since the datasets are stock indices and publicly available data, they may not have formal citations like traditional datasets. Instead, I will note the sources where the data can be accessed:

- For **DJIA**, **SPX**, **NASDAQ 100**, **DAX**, and **Nikkei 225**, the citation can be referenced as:
  > Historical daily stock indices and their corresponding volatility indices are available on Yahoo Finance (https://finance.yahoo.com) and Investing.com (https://www.investing.com).

Since these indices are widely recognized and do not have a specific publication citation, referencing the websites where the data can be found is appropriate.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its source for citation purposes. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
