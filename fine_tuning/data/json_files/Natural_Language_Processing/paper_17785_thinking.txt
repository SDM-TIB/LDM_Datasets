To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DIARIZATIONLM: SPEAKER DIARIZATION POST-PROCESSING WITH LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS" by Quan Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. In the abstract, the authors mention that their experiments show significant improvements in word diarization error rates (WDER) on the **Fisher telephone conversation dataset** and the **Callhome English dataset**. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for their research.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (Section 4) to gather more details about the datasets used. In **Section 4.1 (Datasets)**, the authors explicitly state that they used the **training subset of the Fisher corpus** for finetuning and the **testing subset of the Fisher corpus** and the **testing subset of Callhome American English data** for evaluation. This section provides clear identification of the datasets involved.

Now, I will compile the necessary details for each dataset:

1. **Fisher Telephone Conversation Dataset**: This dataset consists of 1,920 hours of conversations and is widely used in speech recognition and diarization tasks. The authors reference it as a significant resource for their experiments.

2. **Callhome American English Dataset**: This dataset includes 1.7 hours of conversations and is also used for evaluating the performance of their proposed method.

Next, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Fisher corpus**, the citation is:
  > Christopher Cieri, David Miller, and Kevin Walker. *The Fisher corpus: A resource for the next generations of speech-to-text*. In LREC, 2004, vol. 4, pp. 69â€“71.

- For the **Callhome American English dataset**, the citation is:
  > A Canavan, D Graff, and G Zipperlen. *CALLHOME American English speech LDC97S42*. LDC Catalog. Philadelphia: Linguistic Data Consortium, 1997.

With this information, I will summarize the datasets and their citations clearly, ensuring that I have captured all necessary details for future reference or processing.
