To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Low-Rank Rescaled Vision Transformer Fine-Tuning: A Residual Design Approach" by Wei Dong et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections for any references to datasets. The abstract mentions "extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance across various downstream image classification tasks," which suggests that datasets are involved, but does not specify which ones.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In section 4.1, the authors mention conducting experiments on five Fine-Grained Visual Classification (FGVC) datasets and the VTAB-1k benchmark. This is a clear indication that multiple datasets are utilized.

I will then refer to the **supplementary material** where detailed statistics for the datasets are provided. Here, I will find the following datasets listed:

1. **CUB-200-2011**: A dataset for fine-grained bird species recognition, containing 200 classes with a total of 11,788 images (5,794 training images).
   - Citation: Wah, C., Branson, S., Welinder, P., Perona, P., & Belongie, S. (2011). *The Caltech-UCSD Birds 200-2011 Dataset*.

2. **NABirds**: Another dataset for fine-grained bird species recognition, consisting of 200 classes with 48,000 images (24,633 training images).
   - Citation: Van Horn, G., Branson, S., Farrell, R., Haber, S., Barry, J., Ipeirotis, P., Perona, P., & Belongie, S. (2015). *Building a Bird Recognition App and Large Scale Dataset with Citizen Scientists: The Fine Print in Fine-Grained Dataset Collection*.

3. **Oxford Flowers**: A dataset for fine-grained flower species recognition, containing 102 classes with 8,189 images (6,149 training images).
   - Citation: Nilsback, M.-E., & Zisserman, A. (2008). *Automated Flower Classification over a Large Number of Classes*.

4. **Stanford Dogs**: A dataset for fine-grained dog species recognition, consisting of 120 classes with 20,580 images (8,580 training images).
   - Citation: Khosla, A., Jayadevaprakash, N., Yao, B., & Li, F.-F. (2011). *Novel Dataset for Fine-Grained Image Categorization: Stanford Dogs*.

5. **Stanford Cars**: A dataset for fine-grained car classification, containing 196 classes with 16,185 images (8,041 training images).
   - Citation: Krause, J., Stark, D., & Fei-Fei, L. (2013). *3D Object Representations for Fine-Grained Categorization*.

Additionally, the paper mentions the **VTAB-1k** benchmark, which consists of 19 diverse visual classification tasks, but does not provide a specific citation for it in the text. However, I can reference the original paper that introduced the benchmark:
   - Citation: Zhai, X., Puigcerver, J., Kolesnikov, A., Ruyssen, P., Riquelme, C., Pinto, A. S., & Dosovitskiy, A. (2019). *A Large-Scale Study of Representation Learning with the Visual Task Adaptation Benchmark*.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and future reference. This will ensure that I have accurately documented the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations.
