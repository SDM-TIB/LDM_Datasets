To extract datasets from the research paper titled "WE-MATH: Does Your Large Multimodal Model Achieve Human-like Mathematical Reasoning?" by Runqi Qiao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions the introduction of WE-MATH, a benchmark designed to evaluate visual mathematical reasoning, which indicates that a dataset is indeed present. The introduction further elaborates on the dataset's purpose and structure, hinting at its significance in the context of large multimodal models.

Next, I will focus on the **section 2 (WE-MATH)**, where the authors provide a detailed overview of the dataset. Here, they describe the dataset as consisting of **6.5K visual math problems** categorized into **67 hierarchical knowledge concepts**. This section is crucial as it outlines the dataset's composition and its intended use for evaluating reasoning capabilities.

In **subsection 2.1 (Hierarchical Structured Dataset Composition)**, the authors explain how the dataset is organized into five distinct types of mathematical problems, which include Plane Figures, Solid Figures, Transformations and Movements of Shapes, Positions and Directions, and Measurements. This categorization is essential for understanding the dataset's structure.

Moving to **subsection 2.2 (Knowledge-based Reasoning Evaluation)**, the authors detail how the dataset can be used to assess reasoning capabilities through a four-dimensional metric. This section reinforces the dataset's role in evaluating models' reasoning processes.

I will also check the **experiments section** to confirm that the WE-MATH dataset was utilized in the evaluation of various large multimodal models. The authors mention that they conducted thorough evaluations using this dataset, which further validates its importance.

Finally, I will consult the **References section** to gather full citations for the WE-MATH dataset. The citation for the dataset is as follows:
> Runqi Qiao, Qiuna Tan, Guanting Dong, Minhui Wu, Chong Sun, Xiaoshuai Song, Zhuoma GongQue, Shanglin Lei, Zhe Wei, Miaoxuan Zhang, Runfeng Qiao, Yifan Zhang, Xiao Zong, Yida Xu, Muxi Diao, Zhimin Bao, Chen Li, Honggang Zhang. *WE-MATH: Does Your Large Multimodal Model Achieve Human-like Mathematical Reasoning?* arXiv preprint arXiv:2403.14624, 2024.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset details into a structured format for further processing or review.
