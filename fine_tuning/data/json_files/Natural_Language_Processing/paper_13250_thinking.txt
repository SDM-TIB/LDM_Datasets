To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Affordance segmentation of hand-occluded containers from exocentric images" by Tommaso Apicella et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors annotated an existing dataset with mixed-reality images of hand-held containers, which suggests that there is at least one dataset involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors discuss the challenges of visual affordance segmentation and mention existing datasets. They highlight the need for a dataset that addresses hand-occlusions, which implies that they may reference specific datasets.

In the **related work section**, the authors provide a detailed overview of existing datasets for visual affordance segmentation. They mention several datasets, including:

1. **HO-3D**: A dataset for hand-object interaction that includes various challenges. The authors state that they selected and annotated images from this dataset for their experiments.

2. **CORSMAL Containers Manipulation (CCM)**: Another dataset mentioned for evaluating models in real conditions, specifically for hand-object interactions.

3. **CHOC-AFF**: This is a new dataset created by extending the annotation of the existing CHOC dataset with visual affordances. The authors describe how they generated this dataset using mixed-reality images.

I will now check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **HO-3D**, the citation is:
  > S. Hampali, M. Rad, M. Oberweger, and V. Lepetit. *Honnotate: A method for 3D annotation of hand and object poses*. In Conf. Comput. Vis. Pattern Recognit., 2020.

- For **CORSMAL Containers Manipulation (CCM)**, the citation is:
  > A. Xompero, R. Sanchez-Matilla, R. Mazzon, and A. Cavallaro. *CORSMAL Containers Manipulation, 2020*. [Data set]. Queen Mary University of London. https://doi.org/10.17636/101CORSMAL1.

- For **CHOC-AFF**, the citation is:
  > X. Weber, A. Xompero, and A. Cavallaro. *A mixed-reality dataset for category-level 6D pose and size estimation of hand-occluded containers*. arXiv:2211.10470v1 [cs.CV], 2022.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
