To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Exploring Explainability in Video Action Recognition" by Avinab Saha et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the introduction of Video-TCAV and mentions the Kinetics-400 dataset, which is a strong indication that this dataset is relevant to the research.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors mention various models for video action recognition and specifically refer to the Kinetics-400 dataset as the dataset used for training the Video Swin Transformer model. This confirms that Kinetics-400 is a key dataset in their work.

In the **methodology section**, particularly in the parts discussing the generation of concepts for Video-TCAV, the authors detail how they utilize the Kinetics-400 dataset to generate spatial and spatiotemporal concepts. This further solidifies the importance of the Kinetics-400 dataset in their experiments.

I will also check the **experiments section** where the authors describe their experimental setup. They mention collecting videos labeled as "playing tennis" from the Kinetics-400 dataset, which indicates that this dataset is used for specific action recognition tasks.

Finally, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citation for the Kinetics-400 dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Will Kay, Joao Carreira, Karen Simonyan, Brian Zhang, Chloe Hillier, Sudheendra Vijayanarasimhan, Fabio Viola, Tim Green, Trevor Back, Paul Natsev, Mustafa Suleyman, and Andrew Zisserman. *The kinetics human action video dataset*. CoRR, abs/1705.06950, 2017.

Now, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the Kinetics-400 dataset as it is crucial for proper attribution.

In summary, the key dataset extracted from this paper is the Kinetics-400 dataset, which is used extensively in their experiments and methodology.
