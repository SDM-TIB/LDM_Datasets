To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Analysis of XLS-R for Speech Quality Assessment" by Bastiaan Tamm et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the importance of estimating speech quality and mentions the use of pre-trained XLS-R embeddings, but it does not specify datasets yet.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Experimental Setup)**, particularly **subsection 2.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention four specific corpora:

1. **Tencent Corpus**: This dataset consists of around 14,000 Chinese speech clips with varying lengths and includes both clean and reverberated samples.

2. **Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) Corpus**: This corpus contains 80,000 English speech samples derived from LibriVox, each lasting 10 seconds, with both clean and background noise samples.

3. **Non-Intrusive Speech Quality Assessment (NISQA) Corpus**: This dataset includes over 14,000 English and German speech clips, featuring real and simulated noise.

4. **IU Bloomington (IUB) Corpus**: This corpus comprises 36,000 English speech samples from the VOiCES and COSINE datasets, with lengths ranging from three to six seconds.

The authors also mention that each corpus is labeled with Mean Opinion Score (MOS) values, which are essential for their analysis.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For the **Tencent Corpus**, the citation is not explicitly provided in the paper, so I will note that it may require further investigation or may be a proprietary dataset.

- For the **PSTN Corpus**, the citation is:
  > Grancharov, V., & Kleijn, W. (2008). Speech Quality Assessment. In *Springer Handbook of Speech Processing*. Springer.

- For the **NISQA Corpus**, the citation is:
  > Mittag, G., Naderi, B., Chehadi, A., & Möller, S. (2021). NISQA: A Deep CNN-Self-Attention Model for Multidimensional Speech Quality Prediction with Crowdsourced Datasets. In *Interspeech*, 2021, pp. 2127–2131.

- For the **IU Bloomington Corpus**, the citation is:
  > Richey, C., Barrios, M. A., Armstrong, Z., Bartels, C., Franco, H., Graciarena, M., Lawson, A., Nandwana, M. K., Stauffer, A., van Hout, J., Gamble, P., Hetherly, J., Stephenson, C., & Ni, K. (2018). Voices Obscured in Complex Environmental Settings (VOICES) corpus. In *Interspeech*, 2018, pp. 1566–1570.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its full citation for future reference or processing. This structured approach will help maintain clarity and completeness in the dataset extraction process.
