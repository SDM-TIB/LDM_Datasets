To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Zero-Shot Dependency Parsing with Worst-Case Aware Automated Curriculum Learning" by Miryam de Lhoneux et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of multilingual pretrained language models and their effectiveness for cross-lingual transfer, which suggests that datasets are likely involved in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors describe their methodology and the datasets used. In this section, they mention using a sample of **13 typologically diverse languages from Universal Dependencies (UD)** for training their models. This indicates that the Universal Dependencies dataset is a key dataset in their research.

I will then look for a specific **table or section** that lists the languages and corresponding treebanks used in their experiments. In the paper, there is a table (Table 1) that lists the training treebanks along with their language families. This table provides valuable information about the datasets used.

The datasets mentioned in the paper are:

1. **Universal Dependencies (UD)**: This is a collection of treebanks that cover a wide range of languages and is used for multilingual dependency parsing. The authors refer to it as the dataset that provides the most typological diversity.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Universal Dependencies dataset. The citation for the Universal Dependencies is:

- For **Universal Dependencies**:
  > Joakim Nivre, Marie-Catherine de Marneffe, Filip Ginter, Jan Hajič, Christopher D. Manning, Sampo Pyysalo, Sebastian Schuster, Francis Tyers, and Daniel Zeman. *Universal Dependencies v2: An evergrowing multilingual treebank collection*. In Proceedings of the 12th Language Resources and Evaluation Conference, pages 4034–4043, Marseille, France. European Language Resources Association, 2020.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This will ensure that all relevant details are captured for future reference or analysis.
