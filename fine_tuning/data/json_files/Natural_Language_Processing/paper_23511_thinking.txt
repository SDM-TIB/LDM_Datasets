To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Ethical considerations of use of hold-out sets in clinical prediction model management" by Louis Chislett et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses clinical prediction models and the concept of hold-out sets, but does not explicitly mention any datasets. The introduction provides context about clinical prediction models but does not name specific datasets either.

Next, I will examine the **methods section**, particularly the subsections that discuss hold-out sets and their sampling methods. Here, the authors describe the use of hold-out sets in clinical prediction models but do not provide specific datasets. However, they mention two case studies: the **Scottish Patients at Risk of Readmission and Admission (SPARRA) model** and the **Epic Sepsis Model (ESM)**. I will note these as they are relevant examples of clinical prediction models discussed in the paper.

In the **case studies section**, the authors provide more detail about the SPARRA model and the ESM. The SPARRA model predicts the 1-year risk of emergency admission to hospital based on electronic health records in Scotland, while the ESM predicts the risk of sepsis for patients every 15 minutes using electronic health records. These descriptions confirm that both models are indeed datasets used in clinical settings.

Now, I will look at the **references section** to find full citations for the SPARRA model and the ESM. The citations are as follows:

- For the **SPARRA model**, the citation is:
  > Liley, J., Bohner, G., Emerson, S.R., Mateen, B.A., Borland, K., Carr, D., Heald, S., Oduro, S.D., Ireland, J., Moffat, K., Porteous, R., Riddell, S., Cunningham, N., Holmes, C., Payne, K., Vollmer, S.J., Vallejos, C.A., Aslett, L.J.M. (2023). Development and assessment of a machine learning tool for predicting emergency admission in Scotland. *medRxiv*. https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.08.06.21261593

- For the **Epic Sepsis Model (ESM)**, the citation is:
  > Wong, A., Otles, E., Donnelly, J.P., Krumm, A., McCullough, J., DeTroyer-Cooley, O., Pestrue, J., Phillips, M., Konye, J., Penoza, C., Ghous, M., Singh, K. (2021). External validation of a widely implemented proprietary sepsis prediction model in hospitalized patients. *JAMA Internal Medicine*, 181(8), 1065â€“1070. https://doi.org/10.1001/jamainternmed.2021.2626

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets:

1. **SPARRA Model**: A dataset used to predict the 1-year risk of emergency admission to hospital based on electronic health records in Scotland.
2. **Epic Sepsis Model (ESM)**: A dataset that predicts the risk of sepsis for hospitalized patients every 15 minutes using electronic health records.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its full citation.
