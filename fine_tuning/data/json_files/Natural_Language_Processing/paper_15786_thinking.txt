To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Spatio-Temporal Similarity Measure based Multi-Task Learning for Predicting Alzheimer’s Disease Progression using MRI Data" by Xulong Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of biomarkers from MRI data for tracking Alzheimer’s disease progression, which suggests that there may be datasets involved.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **introduction**. The authors refer to using MRI data and cognitive scales like MMSE and ADAS-Cog, indicating that these may be part of the datasets used for their experiments.

In the **methodology section**, I will pay close attention to any descriptions of data sources or datasets. The authors mention using data from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), which is a well-known dataset in Alzheimer’s research. This is a crucial finding, as it indicates a specific dataset used in their study.

I will also check the **experimental results section** for any additional datasets or specific details about the data used in their experiments. The authors mention that they evaluated ADNI-1 subjects, which provides further confirmation of the dataset being used.

Now, I will compile the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. **Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI)**: The citation for this dataset is:
   > Jack, C. R., Bernstein, M. A., Fox, N. C., et al. "The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI): MRI methods." *Journal of Magnetic Resonance Imaging*, vol. 27, no. 4, pp. 685-691, 2008.

2. **Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE)**: While MMSE is a cognitive assessment tool rather than a dataset, it is often referenced in studies involving cognitive decline. The citation for the MMSE is:
   > Kurlowicz, L. H., & Wallace, M. "The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE)." *The Gerontologist*, vol. 39, no. 1, pp. 8-9, 1999.

3. **Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog)**: Similar to MMSE, ADAS-Cog is a cognitive assessment tool. The citation for ADAS-Cog is:
   > Chu, L., Chiu, K., Hui, S., et al. "The reliability and validity of the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog) among the elderly Chinese in Hong Kong." *Annals of the Academy of Medicine, Singapore*, vol. 29, no. 4, pp. 474-485, 2000.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets and their citations in a structured format for easy reference. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research paper along with their full citations.
