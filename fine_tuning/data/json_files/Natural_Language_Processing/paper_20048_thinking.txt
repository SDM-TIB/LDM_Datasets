To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MMoE: Robust Spoiler Detection with Multi-modal Information and Domain-aware Mixture-of-Experts" by Zinan Zeng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their method on "two widely-used spoiler detection datasets," which indicates that datasets are indeed present in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this case, I find that in **section 4.1 (Experiment Settings)**, the authors explicitly state that they evaluate their method on two datasets: the **LCS dataset** and the **Kaggle IMDB Spoiler dataset**.

Now, I will gather details about each dataset:

1. **LCS Dataset**: The authors reference this dataset in the context of their experiments but do not provide a detailed citation in the main text. I will need to check the **References section** for the full citation. The citation for the LCS dataset is:
   > Wang, H., Zhang, W., Bai, Y., Tan, Z., Feng, S., Zheng, Q., & Luo, M. (2023). Detecting spoilers in movie reviews with external movie knowledge and user networks. arXiv preprint arXiv:2304.11411.

2. **Kaggle IMDB Spoiler Dataset**: The authors mention this dataset as well, and it is attributed to Rishabh Misra. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Misra, R. (2019). IMDB spoiler dataset.

After identifying the datasets and their citations, I will ensure that I have the correct format for each dataset entry. I will summarize the key details for each dataset, including their names and citations.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that the full citations are included as they are crucial for proper attribution and reference.
