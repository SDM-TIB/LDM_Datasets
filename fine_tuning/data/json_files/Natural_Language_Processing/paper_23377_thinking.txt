To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Decoupling of neural network calibration measures" by Dominik Werner Wolf et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of the **A2D2 dataset** for semantic segmentation, which indicates that this dataset is likely important for the experiments conducted in the study.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **evaluation setup** sections. In the **Evaluation setup** section, the authors explicitly state that they trained a UNET model on the **A2D2 dataset**. This confirms that the A2D2 dataset is indeed used in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the A2D2 dataset. The citation provided in the references is:
> Geyer, J., Kassahun, Y., Mahmudi, M., Ricou, X., Durgesh, R., Chung, A.S., Hauswald, L., Pham, V.H., Mühlegg, M., Dorn, S., Fernandez, T., Jänicke, M., Mirashi, S., Savani, C., Sturm, M., Vorobiov, O., Oelker, M., Garreis, S., Schuberth, P. *A2D2: Audi Autonomous Driving Dataset*. 2020. https://www.a2d2.audi

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets, I will conclude that the A2D2 dataset is the only dataset referenced in this research.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the A2D2 dataset as required. This will allow for easy reference and verification in future work or discussions.
