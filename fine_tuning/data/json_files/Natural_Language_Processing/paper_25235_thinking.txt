To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Rethinking and Improving Visual Prompt Selection for In-Context Learning Segmentation" by Wei Suo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections for any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments across various datasets, which indicates that multiple datasets are likely involved.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (Section 5) where the authors detail their experimental setup. Here, they specifically mention evaluating their approach on three datasets:

1. **PASCAL-5i**: This dataset is derived from the PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset and includes 20 semantic categories. It is used for few-shot segmentation tasks.

2. **COCO-20i**: This dataset is based on the MSCOCO dataset and contains 80 categories. It is also used for few-shot segmentation tasks.

3. **iSALD-5i**: This dataset is designed for semantic segmentation in remote sensing images and contains 15 geospatial categories.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **PASCAL-5i**, the citation is:
  > Shaban, A., Bansal, S., Liu, Z., Essa, I., Boots, B. (2017). *One-shot learning for semantic segmentation*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1709.03410.

- For **COCO-20i**, the citation is:
  > Lin, T.Y., Maire, M., Belongie, S., Hays, J., Perona, P., Ramanan, D., Dollár, P., Zitnick, C.L. (2014). *Microsoft coco: Common objects in context*. In Computer Vision–ECCV 2014: 13th European Conference, Zurich, Switzerland, September 6-12, 2014, Proceedings, Part V 13. pp. 740–755. Springer.

- For **iSALD-5i**, the citation is:
  > Waqas Zamir, S., Arora, A., Gupta, A., Khan, S., Sun, G., Shahbaz Khan, F., Zhu, F., Shao, L., Xia, G.S., Bai, X. (2019). *ISAID: A large-scale dataset for instance segmentation in aerial images*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops. pp. 28–37.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or processing.
