To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Adversarial Imitation Learning from Visual Observations using Latent Information" by Vittorio Giammarino et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of imitation learning from visual observations and mention that they evaluate their proposed algorithm on the **DeepMind Control Suite**. This indicates that there is at least one dataset involved.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they mention that they conducted experiments on the **DeepMind Control Suite** and provide details about the specific tasks within this suite.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the **DeepMind Control Suite**. The citation is as follows:
> Yuval Tassa, Yotam Doron, Alistair Muldal, Tom Erez, Yazhe Li, Diego de Las Casas, David Budden, Abbas Abdolmaleki, Josh Merel, Andrew Lefrancq, et al. *DeepMind Control Suite*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1801.00690, 2018.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets, I will conclude that the only dataset used is the **DeepMind Control Suite**.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including the full citation, into a structured format for further use.

In summary, the dataset extracted from the paper is:
1. **DeepMind Control Suite**: 
   - Citation: Yuval Tassa, Yotam Doron, Alistair Muldal, Tom Erez, Yazhe Li, Diego de Las Casas, David Budden, Abbas Abdolmaleki, Josh Merel, Andrew Lefrancq, et al. *DeepMind Control Suite*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1801.00690, 2018.
