To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DPO: Differential Reinforcement Learning with Application to Optimal Configuration Search" by Chandrajit Bajaj and Minh Nguyen, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and it may mention specific datasets used for benchmarking or evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 5), as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used in their experiments. In this section, the authors discuss three specific problems related to Lagrangian rewards and mention the datasets used for each problem.

1. **Materials Deformation**: The authors describe a dataset related to the deformation of materials, which involves a functional cost defined in terms of the perimeter and area of shapes. However, they do not provide a specific dataset name, so I will note that this is a conceptual dataset based on the problem description.

2. **Topological Materials Deformation**: Similar to the first problem, this section discusses a dataset that allows modifications to the topological structure of objects. Again, no specific dataset name is provided, so I will note this as a conceptual dataset.

3. **Molecular Dynamics**: The authors describe a dataset involving molecular configurations, specifically the octa-alanine molecule. They mention that the dataset is based on dihedral angles and the energy function calculated using the PyRosetta package. However, they do not provide a specific dataset name or citation.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for any citations related to the datasets mentioned. In this case, the authors reference the PyRosetta package, which is relevant to the molecular dynamics dataset.

The citation for the PyRosetta package is:
> Chaudhury, S., Lyskov, S., Gray, J.J. "PyRosetta: a script-based interface for implementing molecular modeling algorithms using Rosetta." Bioinformatics 26(5), 689â€“691, 2010.

Since the other two datasets are conceptual and do not have specific citations, I will note that they are derived from the problem descriptions in the paper.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format, ensuring to include the relevant citations for the datasets that have them.

In summary, I have identified three datasets from the paper, with one having a specific citation, while the others are conceptual based on the described problems.
