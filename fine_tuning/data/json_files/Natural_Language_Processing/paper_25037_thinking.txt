To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Temporal Convolution Derived Multi-Layered Reservoir Computing" by Johannes Viehweg et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and evaluation sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the prediction of time series and references the Mackey-Glass equation, which suggests that datasets related to time series prediction are likely discussed.

Next, I will focus on the **evaluation section (Section 4)**, where the authors introduce the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they specifically mention the **Mackey-Glass equation** as the dataset for their experiments. The authors describe how they generated time series based on this equation, which is a well-known benchmark in the reservoir computing literature.

In the evaluation section, they provide details about the dataset, including the parameters used for generating the time series (e.g., different values of τ) and the characteristics of the dataset (e.g., chaotic and non-chaotic variations). This confirms that the Mackey-Glass equation is the primary dataset used in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the Mackey-Glass equation. The relevant citation is:

- For the **Mackey-Glass equation**, the citation is:
  > Mackey, M.C., Glass, L. (1977). Oscillation and chaos in physiological control systems. *Science*, 197, 287–289.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry for the Mackey-Glass equation, ensuring to include the full citation as specified.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry in the required format, ready for further processing or review.
