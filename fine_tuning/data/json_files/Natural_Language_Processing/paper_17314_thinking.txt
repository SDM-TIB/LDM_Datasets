To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The Convex Landscape of Neural Networks: Characterizing Global Optima and Stationary Points via Lasso Models" by Tolga Ergen and Mert Pilanci, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets used for experiments or evaluations.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** in detail. This section typically contains information about the datasets used, including their names, sizes, and any specific characteristics that are relevant to the study. I will take note of any datasets that are explicitly referenced.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to ensure that the datasets can be easily located by others. I will look for any papers or resources that describe the datasets in detail.

For each dataset identified, I will compile the following information:
1. **Name of the dataset**: The official name as mentioned in the paper.
2. **Description**: A brief description of the dataset, including its purpose and any relevant details such as the number of samples, features, or specific characteristics.
3. **Full citation**: The complete reference for the dataset, formatted according to academic standards.

Once I have gathered all this information, I will organize it clearly, ensuring that each dataset is well-documented with its name, description, and citation. This will facilitate easy access and understanding for anyone interested in the datasets used in this research.

Finally, I will summarize the findings in a structured format, ready for presentation or further analysis.
