To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Comparative Analysis of Fine-Tuned LLMs and Few-Shot Learning of LLMs for Financial Sentiment Analysis" by Sorouralsadat Fatemi and Yuheng Hu, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract provides a general overview, but the methodology section is likely to contain specific details about the datasets used for fine-tuning and evaluation.

In **section 4 (Performance Evaluation)**, the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for fine-tuning and testing. They describe the **Twitter Financial News Sentiment (Twitter Train)** dataset, which consists of tweets related to financial topics, and is used for training the models. This dataset has 9,540 samples labeled as Positive, Negative, or Neutral.

Next, the authors detail the **testing datasets**:

1. **Twitter Financial News Sentiment Validation (TFSN)**: This dataset contains 2,390 samples of finance-related tweets, also labeled as Positive, Negative, or Neutral.

2. **Financial PhraseBank (FPB)**: This dataset consists of 4,845 samples extracted from financial news articles, annotated by domain experts, and includes sentiment labels of Positive, Negative, or Neutral.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. However, the paper does not provide specific citations for the datasets used, which is common for datasets that are publicly available or widely recognized in the field.

Since the Twitter Financial News Sentiment dataset is mentioned as being accessible through HuggingFace, I can note that it is a publicly available dataset. The same applies to the other datasets mentioned, as they are also available through HuggingFace.

To summarize, I will compile the dataset information as follows:

1. **Twitter Financial News Sentiment (Twitter Train)**: 9,540 samples labeled as Positive, Negative, or Neutral. Accessible via HuggingFace.

2. **Twitter Financial News Sentiment Validation (TFSN)**: 2,390 samples labeled as Positive, Negative, or Neutral. Accessible via HuggingFace.

3. **Financial PhraseBank (FPB)**: 4,845 samples labeled as Positive, Negative, or Neutral. Accessible via HuggingFace.

Since the paper does not provide specific citations for these datasets, I will note that they are available through HuggingFace and can be referenced accordingly.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for review or further processing, ensuring that I clearly indicate the accessibility of each dataset.
