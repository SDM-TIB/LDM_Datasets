To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Unified Deep Image Deraining: A Survey and A New Benchmark" by Xiang Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and datasets sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the construction of a new benchmark called **HQ-RAIN**, which indicates that there are datasets involved. I will also look for any references to existing datasets in the introduction.

Next, I will focus on **section 3.5 (Deraining Datasets)**, where the authors provide a detailed overview of various datasets used for image deraining. This section is likely to contain the names and descriptions of the datasets, which is crucial for my extraction process.

In this section, the authors mention several datasets, including:

1. **Rain12**: A test dataset containing 12 synthesized images with a single type of rain streak.

2. **Rain100L and Rain100H**: These datasets contain 1,800 synthetic image pairs for training and 100 for testing, created using simulated rain streaks.

3. **DID-Data (Rain1200)**: This dataset consists of 12,000 synthetic training pairs and 1,200 test pairs with varying rain densities.

4. **SPA-Data**: A real-world dataset containing 638,492 rainy/clear image patches for training and 1,000 for testing.

5. **HQ-RAIN**: The new benchmark dataset proposed in this paper, containing 4,500 synthetic images for training and 500 for testing.

After identifying these datasets, I will compile their descriptions and citations into a structured format. I will ensure that each dataset is clearly described, and the full citation is provided for each one.

Finally, I will summarize the extracted datasets and their citations, ensuring that I have accurately represented the information as presented in the paper.
