To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Graph Neural Networks and Applied Linear Algebra" by Nicholas S. Moore et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections that discuss experiments and methodologies**. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's focus on graph neural networks (GNNs) and their application in numerical linear algebra, but it does not mention specific datasets.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any references to datasets. The introduction discusses the relevance of GNNs in computational science but does not explicitly mention datasets.

I will then look into **section 4 (Training Within GNN Frameworks)**, which discusses two examples of GNN applications. The first example is about learning a diagonal for the Jacobi iteration, and it includes a subsection titled **4.1.1. Datasets**. Here, the authors describe the dataset generation process in detail:

1. **2D Poisson Operator Dataset**: This dataset is generated by varying the location and width of a band in a mesh. The steps for producing the datasets are outlined, including creating a uniform mesh, selecting parameters, and generating matrices based on finite element discretization.

The authors specify that:
- The training set consists of 800 matrices.
- The validation set consists of 50 matrices.
- The test set consists of 150 matrices.

Next, I will check the **second example in section 4.2**, which focuses on training a GNN to determine diffusion coefficients. This section also contains a subsection titled **4.2.1. Datasets**. The authors describe the dataset generation process for diffusion coefficients, which involves discretizing a diffusion operator and generating matrices based on specific parameters.

The dataset details include:
- A total of 1000 matrices generated.
- The training set consists of 700 matrices.
- The validation set consists of 200 matrices.
- The test set consists of 100 matrices.

Now, I will compile the full citations for the datasets mentioned in the paper. The citations are not explicitly provided in the text, so I will reference the original sources where applicable.

1. For the **2D Poisson Operator Dataset**, the citation is:
   > The dataset is generated based on the finite element discretization of the 2D Poisson operator, as described in the paper.

2. For the **Diffusion Coefficients Dataset**, the citation is:
   > The dataset is generated from discretizing the diffusion operator as described in the paper.

Finally, I will summarize the datasets extracted from the paper, ensuring to include the necessary details and citations.

In conclusion, I will prepare the dataset entries for review, ensuring that they are clearly documented and ready for any further processing or analysis.
