To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Leveraging YOLO-World and GPT-4V LMMs for Zero-Shot Person Detection and Action Recognition in Drone Imagery" by Christian Limberg et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and evaluation sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their methods using a publicly available dataset, which suggests that there is at least one dataset to extract.

Next, I will focus on **section III (Evaluation)**, specifically **subsection A (Dataset)**, where the authors explicitly mention the **Okutama-Action dataset**. They describe it as a dataset that captures multiple persons from aerial views using drones, detailing the actions performed by individuals in the dataset. This section provides crucial information about the dataset's characteristics, such as the number of actions and the context in which the data was collected.

The authors mention that the dataset includes recordings of various actions performed by individuals, which is essential for understanding its application in their experiments. They also specify that they are focusing on the test dataset, which consists of 10 flights totaling 9 minutes and 32 seconds.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the **Okutama-Action dataset**. The citation provided in the references is:
> M. Barekatain, M. Martí, H.-F. Shih, S. Murray, K. Nakayama, Y. Matsuo, and H. Prendinger. *Okutama-Action: An aerial view video dataset for concurrent human action detection*. In Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR) Workshops, 06 2017, pp. 28–35.

With this information, I can summarize the dataset details as follows:

1. **Okutama-Action Dataset**: This dataset is designed for concurrent human action detection from aerial views, capturing multiple individuals performing various actions. It consists of recordings from drone flights, with a focus on specific actions relevant to person detection and action recognition tasks.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format for further processing, ensuring that the full citation is included for proper attribution.
