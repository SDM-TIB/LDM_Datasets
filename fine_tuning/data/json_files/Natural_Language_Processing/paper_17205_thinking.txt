To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Advancements in Content-Based Image Retrieval: A Comprehensive Survey of Relevance Feedback Techniques" by Hamed Qazanfari et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a general overview of the paper's focus on content-based image retrieval (CBIR) and relevance feedback (RF), but it does not specify any datasets.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any references to datasets used in the studies discussed. The introduction mentions various challenges and techniques in CBIR but does not provide specific dataset names.

I will then look into the **research background and related works sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned in the context of the studies cited. The paper references multiple studies, and I will need to check if any of these studies include datasets that are relevant to the survey.

In the **references section**, I will find full citations for the studies mentioned throughout the paper. This is crucial because even if the datasets are not explicitly named in the main text, the referenced studies may provide the necessary details.

For example, if I find that a study referenced in the paper discusses a dataset, I will extract the dataset name and the full citation for that study. I will ensure to note down the following details for each dataset:
1. The name of the dataset.
2. A brief description of the dataset, including its purpose and any relevant characteristics.
3. The full citation of the study where the dataset is mentioned.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important datasets and that I provide accurate citations for each one.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for output, ensuring they are clear and ready for any further processing or review.
