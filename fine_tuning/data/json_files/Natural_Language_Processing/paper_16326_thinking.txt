To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MetaFBP: Learning to Learn High-Order Predictor for Personalized Facial Beauty Prediction" by Luojun Lin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the research focus and any datasets that might be referenced. The abstract indicates that the authors built several PFBP benchmarks using existing facial beauty prediction datasets rated by numerous users, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any relevant sections that discuss the datasets used in their experiments. In this paper, the authors mention three specific datasets: **PFBP-SCUT500**, **PFBP-SCUT5500**, and **PFBP-US10K**. I will extract the details about each dataset, including their characteristics and the number of images and users involved.

1. **PFBP-SCUT5500**: This dataset consists of 5,500 face images, each rated by 60 users, totaling 135,000 annotations. It is collected from SCUT-FBP5500 and includes a diverse range of facial images.

2. **PFBP-SCUT500**: This dataset contains 500 facial images from the Asian female population, rated by 75 volunteers. It is designed to capture aesthetic preferences and includes a total of 12,500 annotations.

3. **PFBP-US10K**: This dataset is sampled from the 10K US Adult Faces dataset and consists of 2,222 facial images rated by 12 users. It aims to assess aesthetic preferences in a different demographic context.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **references section** of the paper to find the full citations for the original datasets used to create the PFBP benchmarks. The citations will be crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **SCUT-FBP5500**:
  > Lingyu Liang, Luojun Lin, Lianwen Jin, Duorui Xie, and Mengru Li. *SCUT-FBP5500: A diverse benchmark dataset for multi-paradigm facial beauty prediction*. In Proceedings of the 24th International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR), pages 1598–1603, 2018.

- For **SCUT-FBP500**:

- For **10K US Adult Faces**:
  > The dataset is referenced as part of the work by Wang et al. (2014) in their paper titled *Exploring Attractive Faces: General versus Personal Preferences*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Multimedia and Expo (ICMEW), pages 1–2.

Now, I will compile the extracted dataset information along with their citations into a structured format for further processing or review.
