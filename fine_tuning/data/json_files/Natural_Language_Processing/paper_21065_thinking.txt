To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Active Exploration in Bayesian Model-based Reinforcement Learning for Robot Manipulation" by Carlos Plou et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract discusses the challenges of data gathering in robotics and mentions the use of simulations, which suggests that datasets may be involved, but I need to find specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, I will look for any references to specific datasets or benchmarks that were utilized in their experiments.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention two environments used for their experiments:

1. **OpenAI Gym**: This is a widely used toolkit for developing and comparing reinforcement learning algorithms. The paper states that they conducted experiments using various tasks from OpenAI Gym, specifically mentioning the **HalfCheetah** environment.

2. **RLBench**: This is another benchmark mentioned in the paper, which is built around a CoppeliaSim/V-REP simulation environment. The authors describe tasks such as **PushButton** and **MoveBlockToTarget** that were tested within this framework.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets or environments:

- For **OpenAI Gym**, the citation is:
  > Greg Brockman, Vicki Cheung, Ludwig Pettersson, Jonas Schneider, John Schulman, Jie Tang, and Wojciech Zaremba. *OpenAI Gym*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01540, 2016.

- For **RLBench**, the citation is:
  > Stephen James, Zicong Ma, David Rovick Arrojo, and Andrew J Davison. *RLBench: The robot learning benchmark & learning environment*. RA-L, 5(2):3019â€“3026, 2020.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and that the full citations are included. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
