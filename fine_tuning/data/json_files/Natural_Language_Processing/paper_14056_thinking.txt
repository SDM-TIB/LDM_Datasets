To extract datasets from the research paper titled "LMDX: Language Model-based Document Information Extraction and Localization" by Vincent Perot et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and evaluation sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the application of LMDX to benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **evaluation section** where the authors discuss their experiments. They mention using the **VRDU** and **CORD** benchmarks, which are likely datasets used for evaluation. I will look for specific details about these datasets.

In the **evaluation section**, the authors provide descriptions of the datasets:

1. **VRDU (Visually Rich Document Understanding)**: This dataset consists of two public benchmarks: 
   - **Registration Form**: Contains 1915 documents related to foreign agents' activities requiring public disclosure.
   - **Ad-Buy Form**: Comprises 641 signed receipts between a TV station and a political campaign group.

2. **CORD (Consolidated Receipt Dataset)**: This dataset includes 1000 Indonesian receipts from various shops and restaurants, which have been de-identified to remove personally identifiable information.

Now, I will check the **References section** for full citations of these datasets:

- For **VRDU**, the citation is:
  > Wang, Shuhe, et al. "VRDU: A benchmark for visually-rich document understanding." In Proceedings of the 29th ACM SIGKDD Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, KDD '23, pages 5184â€“5193, 2023.

- For **CORD**, the citation is:
  > Park, Bodhisattwa Prasad, et al. "CORD: A consolidated receipt dataset for post-OCR parsing." In Workshop on Document Intelligence at NeurIPS 2019.

With these citations, I can now compile the dataset entries. Each dataset will be documented with its name, description, and full citation to ensure proper attribution.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring that all necessary information is included for each dataset extracted from the paper.
