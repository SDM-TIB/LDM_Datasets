To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A fast method for simultaneous reconstruction and segmentation in X-ray CT application" by Yiqiu Dong et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for validation. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets, while the experimental sections typically detail the datasets used for testing the proposed methods.

In the **introduction**, I will look for any references to datasets or benchmarks that the authors might have used. If the authors mention any specific datasets or provide context about the data they are working with, I will take note of those.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental section**, which is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets used in the experiments. I will look for sections that explicitly mention datasets, such as "Datasets," "Data Collection," or "Experimental Setup." Here, I will identify the names of the datasets, their characteristics, and any relevant details provided by the authors.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. I will ensure that I capture the authors, title, publication venue, and year for each dataset.

For example, if the authors mention a dataset like "AIR Tools" in their experiments, I will look for its citation in the references. If it is not explicitly cited, I will search for the original source of the dataset based on the context provided in the paper.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference.

In summary, my step-by-step approach will be:
1. Read the abstract, introduction, and experimental sections to identify any datasets mentioned.
2. Take note of specific datasets, their characteristics, and any relevant details.
3. Check the References section for full citations of each dataset.
4. Compile the dataset information, including names, descriptions, and citations, for documentation.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets used in the research paper.
