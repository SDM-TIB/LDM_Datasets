To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ViCo: Word Embeddings from Visual Co-occurrences" by Tanmay Gupta et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors utilize large-scale, textually-annotated visual databases like **VisualGenome** and **ImageNet** for their work. This suggests that these datasets are crucial to the research.

Next, I will examine the **methodology section** (specifically section 3.3, titled "Computing Visual Co-occurrence Counts") where the authors describe how they compute visual co-occurrence counts. They explicitly mention using **Visual Genome** and **ImageNet** for estimating visual co-occurrence counts. This confirms that both datasets are integral to their approach.

In the **experiments section**, the authors discuss their evaluation methods and datasets used for testing the performance of their embeddings. They mention using **CIFAR-100** for zero-shot-like analysis, which is another dataset that needs to be included.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset from the **References section** of the paper:

1. **Visual Genome**: The citation is:
   > Krishna, R., Honnibal, M., & Johnson, J. (2017). *Visual Genome: Connecting Language and Vision Using Crowdsourced Dense Image Annotations*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 1-10.

2. **ImageNet**: The citation is:
   > Deng, J., Dong, W., Socher, R., Li, J., Li, K., & Fei-Fei, L. (2009). *ImageNet: A Large-Scale Hierarchical Image Database*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 248-255.

3. **CIFAR-100**: The citation is:
   > Krizhevsky, A., & Hinton, G. (2009). *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical report, University of Toronto.

After collecting the necessary information, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

- **Visual Genome**: A dataset that provides dense annotations of images, including object and attribute annotations.
- **ImageNet**: A large-scale dataset for image classification and object detection, organized hierarchically.
- **CIFAR-100**: A dataset consisting of 100 classes with 600 images each, used for evaluating zero-shot learning.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
