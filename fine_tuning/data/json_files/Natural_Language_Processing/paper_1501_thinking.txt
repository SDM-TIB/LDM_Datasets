To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SongNet: Rigid Formats Controlled Text Generation" by Piji Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted extensive experiments on two collected corpora, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.2 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly mention the two datasets they collected for their experiments:

1. **SongCi Dataset**: This dataset consists of 19,244 training samples, 847 validation samples, and 962 test samples. It is a corpus of classical Chinese poetry.

2. **Sonnet Dataset**: This dataset contains 100 training samples, 27 validation samples, and 27 test samples. It is based on Shakespeare's Sonnets.

In the **References section**, I will look for full citations for these datasets. The authors reference Shakespeare's work, which is crucial for the Sonnet dataset. The citation for Shakespeare's Sonnets is:

- For **Shakespeare's Sonnets**:
  > William Shakespeare. 2000. *Shakespeareâ€™s sonnets*. Yale University Press.

The SongCi dataset does not have a specific citation provided in the references, but it is described as a collected corpus of classical Chinese poetry. Therefore, I will note that it is a dataset created by the authors for their research.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations where applicable. 

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for review or further processing.
