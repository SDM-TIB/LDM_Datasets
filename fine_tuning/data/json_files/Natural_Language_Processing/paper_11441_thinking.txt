To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Zero-Shot Anomaly Detection with Pre-trained Segmentation Models" by Matthew Baugh et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors achieved an average F1-max score on the **VisA dataset**, which suggests that this dataset is significant to their research.

Next, I will move to the **introduction** section. Here, the authors discuss the need for more data-efficient methods and mention the **MVTec dataset** as a benchmark for unsupervised anomaly detection. This indicates that both the VisA and MVTec datasets are relevant to their work.

In the **results section**, the authors provide performance metrics on the VisA dataset, confirming its importance in their experiments. They also reference the MVTec dataset, which is used as a comparison point for their method's performance.

Now, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

1. **VisA Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Zou, Y., Jeong, J., Pemula, L., Zhang, D., Dabeer, O. *Spot-the-difference self-supervised pre-training for anomaly detection and segmentation*. In: Avidan, S., Brostow, G., Cissè, M., Farinella, G.M., Hassner, T. (eds.) Computer Vision – ECCV 2022. pp. 392–408. Springer Nature Switzerland, Cham (2022).

2. **MVTec Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Bergmann, P., Batzner, K., Fauser, M., Sattlegger, D., Steger, C. *The MVTec anomaly detection dataset: a comprehensive real-world dataset for unsupervised anomaly detection*. International Journal of Computer Vision 129(4), 1038–1059 (2021).

With these citations in hand, I can now summarize the datasets:

- **VisA Dataset**: Used for evaluating the authors' method, achieving an average F1-max score of 24.2 at the pixel level.
- **MVTec Dataset**: Mentioned as a benchmark for unsupervised anomaly detection, with high performance metrics reported.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its full citation.
