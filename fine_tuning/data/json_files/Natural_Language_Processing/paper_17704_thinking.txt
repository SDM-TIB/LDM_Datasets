To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Consumer Participation in Community-Supported Agriculture: Modeling Decision-Making Dynamics through a Scoping Review and the KJ Method" by Sota Takagi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned or referenced. The abstract discusses the factors influencing consumer participation in Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) but does not explicitly mention any datasets.

Next, I will examine the **Materials and Methods** section, particularly the **Data collection: Scoping review** subsection. Here, the authors describe their methodology for conducting a scoping review using various databases, including the Web of Science. They mention that they screened a total of 62 papers, but they do not refer to any specific datasets used in their analysis.

I will also look at the **Results** section, where the authors present findings from their scoping review. They mention extracting 306 factors from the 62 papers but again do not specify any datasets. Instead, they provide a correspondence table in the appendix that categorizes these factors.

Since the paper does not explicitly mention any datasets, I will check the **References section** to see if any of the cited works include datasets relevant to the study. However, the references primarily consist of literature discussing CSA and consumer behavior rather than datasets themselves.

After thoroughly reviewing the paper, it appears that there are no specific datasets cited or utilized in the research. The authors focus on qualitative analysis and theoretical modeling rather than empirical data derived from datasets.

In conclusion, I will document that no datasets were extracted from this paper, as the research primarily relies on literature review and qualitative analysis rather than quantitative data from specific datasets. Therefore, there are no full citations to provide for datasets, as none were identified in the text.
