To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Survey of Action Recognition, Spotting and Spatio-Temporal Localization in Soccer - Current Trends and Research Perspectives" by Karolina Seweryn et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections that discuss datasets** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a general overview of the paper's focus on action recognition in soccer, which suggests that datasets will be discussed in detail later.

Next, I will look specifically at **section 5 (Datasets)**, as this section is likely to contain the most relevant information regarding the datasets used in the research. In this section, the authors provide a comprehensive list of soccer datasets, including:

1. **SoccerNet**: A benchmark dataset for action spotting in soccer, consisting of 500 matches from major European Championships, with annotations for actions like goals and substitutions.
   - Citation: Giancola, S., & Ghanem, B. (2018). *Soccernet: A scalable dataset for action spotting in soccer videos*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops (CVPRW), pages 1792–179210.

2. **SoccerNet-v2**: An enriched version of SoccerNet with 17 action categories and more frequent annotations.
   - Citation: Deliège, A., Cioppa, A., Giancola, S., Ghanem, B., & Van Droogenbroeck, M. (2021). *Soccernet-v2: A dataset and benchmarks for holistic understanding of broadcast soccer videos*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops (CVPRW), pages 4503–4514.

3. **SoccerNet-v3**: An extension of SoccerNet-v2 that includes spatial annotations and multi-view analysis.
   - Citation: Cioppa, A., Deliège, A., Giancola, S., Ghanem, B., & Van Droogenbroeck, M. (2022). *Scaling up soccernet with multi-view spatial localization and re-identification*. Scientific Data, 9, 355.

4. **Football Actions**: A dataset consisting of match recordings from multiple cameras with annotations for various actions.
   - Citation: Tsunoda, T., Komori, Y., Matsugu, M., & Harada, T. (2017). *Football action recognition using hierarchical LSTM*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops (CVPRW), pages 155–163.

5. **Comprehensive Soccer**: A dataset containing broadcast soccer videos with annotations for multiple tasks.
   - Citation: Yu, J., Lei, A., & Hu, Y. (2018). *Comprehensive dataset of broadcast soccer videos*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Multimedia Information Processing and Retrieval (MIPR), pages 418–423.

6. **MultiSports**: A multi-person action detection dataset for various sports, including soccer.
   - Citation: Li, Y., Wang, Z., Chen, L., & Wu, G. (2021). *Multisports: A multi-person video dataset of spatio-temporally localized sports actions*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 13516–13525.

After identifying these datasets, I will ensure to note down their full citations as they are crucial for proper referencing.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format for easy access and future reference, ensuring that each dataset is accompanied by its full citation.
