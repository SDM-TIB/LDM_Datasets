To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Does Circuit Analysis Interpretability Scale? Evidence from Multiple Choice Capabilities in Chinchilla" by Tom Lieberum et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections for any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the use of the **Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU)** benchmark, which is a strong indication that this is a dataset used in the research.

Next, I will look into the **methodology** and **experiments** sections, particularly focusing on any sections that explicitly discuss datasets. In the paper, the authors describe their experiments with the **MMLU** benchmark in detail, indicating that it consists of roughly 16,000 examples across various topics. This confirms that MMLU is a primary dataset utilized in their analysis.

I will also check the **references** section to find the full citation for the MMLU dataset. The citation for the MMLU benchmark is as follows:
- **Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU)**: 
  > Hendrycks, D., Burns, C., Basart, S., Zou, A., Mazeika, M., Song, D., & Steinhardt, J. (2020). Measuring massive multitask language understanding. arXiv preprint arXiv:2009.03300.

After identifying the dataset and its citation, I will ensure that I have captured all relevant details about the dataset, including its purpose and characteristics as described in the paper.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format for clarity and future reference, ensuring that the citation is included for proper attribution.
