To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Adversarial Doodles: Interpretable and Human-Drawable Attacks" by Ryoya Nara and Yusuke Matsui, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are referenced. The abstract mentions the use of the **Caltech-101 dataset** for training classifiers, which is a good indication that this dataset is significant to the research.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (Section 5) where the authors describe their experimental setup. Here, they explicitly state that they used the **Caltech-101 dataset** for their experiments, which confirms its relevance. The authors also mention the classifiers they trained, which further emphasizes the importance of this dataset in their methodology.

I will also check the **related work** and **methodology sections** to see if any other datasets are mentioned or used in the context of their experiments or comparisons. However, the primary focus appears to be on the Caltech-101 dataset.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citation for the Caltech-101 dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:

- For **Caltech-101 dataset**:
  > Li Fei-Fei, R. Fergus, and P. Perona. *Learning generative visual models from few training examples: An incremental bayesian approach tested on 101 object categories*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2004.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets, I will conclude that the only dataset extracted from this paper is the Caltech-101 dataset.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry with the full citation into a structured format for clarity and future reference. This ensures that I have accurately captured the necessary information regarding the dataset used in the research.
