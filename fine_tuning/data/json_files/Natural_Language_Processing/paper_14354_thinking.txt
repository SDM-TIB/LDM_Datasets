To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Harnessing Diverse Data for Global Disaster Prediction: A Multimodal Framework" by Gengyin Liu and Huaiyang Zhong, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** to get an overview of the research focus and the types of data being utilized. The abstract mentions a multimodal framework that combines weather statistics, satellite imagery, and textual insights for disaster predictions, specifically focusing on floods and landslides. This indicates that there are multiple datasets involved.

Next, I will examine **section 2 (Data preparation)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their analysis. They explicitly mention two datasets:

1. **Geocoded Disasters (GDIS) dataset**: This dataset is referenced as a source for detailed disaster data, including locations and names of disasters. It is noted that the dataset focuses on various disaster types, with floods being a significant focus.

2. **EM-DAT disaster dataset**: This dataset is also mentioned as a source for assembling disaster data, providing comprehensive information about disaster occurrences.

In this section, the authors also discuss the criteria for selecting cities based on disaster occurrences, which further emphasizes the relevance of the GDIS dataset.

I will then look at the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **GDIS dataset**, the citation is:
  > Elisabeth L. Rosvold and Halvard Buhaug. *GDIS, a global dataset of geocoded disaster locations*. Scientific Data, 8(1):61, 2021.

- For the **EM-DAT disaster dataset**, the citation is:
  > EM-DAT. *The International Disaster Dataset*. Available at: https://www.emdat.be/, 2023.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and future reference. Each dataset will be described with its name, a brief description, and the full citation to ensure proper attribution.

Finally, I will ensure that the dataset entries are ready for review or further processing, maintaining a clear and organized presentation of the extracted information.
