To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Coordination Failure in Cooperative Offline MARL" by Callum Rhys Tilbury et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the use of "static datasets of experience," which indicates that datasets are involved. I will look for specific names or descriptions of these datasets.

Next, I will examine the **methodology** and **experiments** sections, as these typically contain detailed information about the datasets used in the research. I will look for any sections explicitly labeled as "Datasets" or similar, as they often summarize the datasets utilized in the study.

In the **experiments section**, I will pay close attention to any mentions of datasets used for training or evaluation. If the authors refer to specific datasets, I will note their names, sizes, and any relevant characteristics described in the text.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets themselves.

For example, if the authors mention using a dataset like "MAMuJoCo," I will look for the original paper or source that introduced this dataset to provide a complete citation. 

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This will allow for a clear and organized presentation of the datasets used in the research.

Finally, I will ensure that all entries are formatted consistently and accurately, ready for any further processing or review.
