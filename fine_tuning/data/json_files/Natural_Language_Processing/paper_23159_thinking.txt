To extract the datasets mentioned in the paper titled "D-CoRP: Differentiable Connectivity Refinement for Functional Brain Networks" by Haoyu Hu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and the introduction often highlights the significance of the datasets used. In this case, the authors mention evaluating their method on three datasets of functional brain networks, which indicates that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experiments and Results)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. They mention three datasets for brain age prediction:

1. **1000 Functional Connectomes Project (FCP)**: This dataset includes 1,003 healthy subjects aged 18-85 years, with a mean age of 28 years and a gender distribution of 569 females.

2. **Enhanced Nathan Kline Institute - Rockland Sample (NKI-Rockland)**: This dataset consists of 393 subjects with a mean age of 35 years, including 164 females, and is noted for its wide age range (4-85 years).

3. **ADHD-Normal**: This dataset includes 330 normal subjects (no diseases) with a mean age of 12 years and 166 females, focusing on a younger demographic.

The authors also mention that all datasets are available in the UCLA multimodal connectivity database, which is an important detail for accessibility.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For the **1000 Functional Connectomes Project (FCP)**, the citation is:
  > Biswal, B.B., Mennes, M., Zuo, X.N., Gohel, S., Kelly, C., Smith, S.M., Beckmann, C.F., Adelstein, J.S., Buckner, R.L., Colcombe, S., et al. *Toward discovery science of human brain function*. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 107(10), 4734â€“4739, 2010.

- For the **NKI-Rockland Sample**, the citation is:
  > Nooner, K.B., Colcombe, S.J., Tobe, R.H., Mennes, M., Benedict, M.M., Moreno, A.L., Panek, L.J., Brown, S., Zavitz, S.T., Li, Q., et al. *The NKI-Rockland sample: a model for accelerating the pace of discovery science in psychiatry*. Frontiers in Neuroscience, 6, 152, 2012.

- For the **ADHD-Normal** dataset, the citation is:
  > The ADHD-200 Consortium. *The ADHD-200 consortium: a model to advance the translational potential of neuroimaging in clinical neuroscience*. Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience, 6, 62, 2012.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations to ensure clarity and completeness in the final output. This structured approach will help in accurately representing the datasets used in the research.
