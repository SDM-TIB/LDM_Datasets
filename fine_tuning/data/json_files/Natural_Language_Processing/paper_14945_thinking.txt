To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Lifelong Sequence Generation with Dynamic Module Expansion and Adaptation" by Chengwei Qin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for experiments. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the research, which might include references to datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **experiments**. In this paper, I will specifically check sections that discuss the methodology and experimental setup, as these sections typically detail the datasets used. For instance, I will look for any mention of datasets in sections like **Methodology** or **Experimental Setup**.

In the **Methodology section**, the authors describe the tasks investigated, which include natural language generation, summarization, task-oriented dialogue, and SQL query generation. They mention specific datasets associated with these tasks, such as:

1. **RNNLG Dataset**: Used for natural language generation tasks.
2. **E2ENLG Dataset**: Another dataset for natural language generation.
3. **CNNDM Dataset**: Used for summarization tasks.
4. **WikiSQL Dataset**: Used for SQL query generation.
5. **MultiWOZ Dataset**: Used for task-oriented dialogue modeling.

After identifying these datasets, I will then proceed to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets.

The citations I will extract are as follows:

- For **RNNLG Dataset**:
  > Wen, T. H., Mrkšić, N., Gasic, M., & Young, S. (2015). *Semantically conditioned LSTM-based natural language generation for spoken dialogue systems*. In Proceedings of the 2015 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (pp. 1711-1721). Association for Computational Linguistics.

- For **E2ENLG Dataset**:
  > Novikova, J., Dušek, O., & Rieser, V. (2017). *The E2E dataset: New challenges for end-to-end generation*. In Proceedings of the 18th Annual SIGdial Meeting on Discourse and Dialogue (pp. 201-206). Association for Computational Linguistics.

- For **CNNDM Dataset**:
  > See, A., Liu, P. J., & Manning, C. D. (2017). *Get to the point: Summarization with pointer-generator networks*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1704.04368.

- For **WikiSQL Dataset**:
  > Zhong, V., Xiong, C., & Socher, R. (2017). *Seq2sql: Generating structured queries from natural language using reinforcement learning*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1709.00103.

- For **MultiWOZ Dataset**:
  > Budzianowski, P., Wen, T. H., Tseng, B. H., Casanueva, I., Ultes, S., Ramadan, O., & Gašić, M. (2018). *MultiWOZ - a large-scale multi-domain Wizard-of-Oz dataset for task-oriented dialogue modelling*. In Proceedings of the 2018 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (pp. 5016-5026). Association for Computational Linguistics.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information along with their citations into a structured format for easy reference. This ensures that I have accurately captured all relevant datasets and their sources from the paper.
