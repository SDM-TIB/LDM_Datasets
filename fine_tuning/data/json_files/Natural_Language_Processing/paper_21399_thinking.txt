To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MambaAD: Exploring State Space Models for Multi-class Unsupervised Anomaly Detection" by Haoyang He et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors conducted experiments on "six diverse anomaly detection datasets," which indicates that multiple datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4.1) where the authors provide details about the datasets used. Here, they explicitly list the datasets:

1. **MVTec-AD**: This dataset consists of 5 types of textures and 10 types of objects, totaling 5,354 high-resolution images. It includes 3,629 normal images for training and 1,725 images for testing, which contain both normal and abnormal samples.

2. **VisA**: This dataset features 12 different objects, with a total of 10,821 images, including 9,621 normal samples and 1,200 anomaly samples.

3. **Real-IAD**: This dataset includes objects from 30 distinct categories, comprising 150K high-resolution images, with 99,721 normal images and 51,329 anomaly images.

The authors also mention additional datasets in the appendix, such as **MVTec-3D**, **Uni-Medical**, and **COCO-AD**, but I will focus on the primary datasets mentioned in the main text for now.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **MVTec-AD**, the citation is:
  > P. Bergmann, M. Fauser, D. Sattlegger, and C. Steger. *MVTec AD â€“ A Comprehensive Real-World Dataset for Unsupervised Anomaly Detection*. In CVPR, 2019.

- For **VisA**, the citation is:
  > Y. Zou, J. Jeong, L. Pemula, D. Zhang, and O. Dabeer. *Spot-the-Difference Self-Supervised Pre-Training for Anomaly Detection and Segmentation*. In ECCV, 2022.

- For **Real-IAD**, the citation is:
  > C. Wang, W. Zhu, B.-B. Gao, Z. Gan, J. Zhang, Z. Gu, S. Qian, M. Chen, and L. Ma. *Real-IAD: A Real-World Multi-View Dataset for Benchmarking Versatile Industrial Anomaly Detection*. In CVPR, 2024.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations.
