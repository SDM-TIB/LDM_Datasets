To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Evaluating Document Simplification: On the Importance of Separately Assessing Simplicity and Meaning Preservation" by Liam Cripwell et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus, which may hint at the datasets used. The introduction often discusses the context and significance of the datasets, so I will pay close attention to any references to specific datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or data sources, which is typically where authors describe the datasets they used for their experiments. In this paper, I will specifically check **section 3 (Experimental Setup)**, as it is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets employed in the study.

Upon reviewing section 3.1, I find that the authors mention two primary datasets:

1. **Newsela Dataset**: This dataset consists of 1,130 English news articles that have been manually rewritten by professional editors at five different discrete reading levels (0-4) of increasing simplicity. The authors note that it is often considered the gold standard for document simplification tasks.

2. **Standard English Wikipedia (EW) Articles**: The authors use standard English Wikipedia articles from Wiki-auto, which are annotated with semantic types according to their WikiData entries. They selected 1,000 documents for their out-of-domain evaluation.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. 

- For the **Newsela Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Xu, W., Callison-Burch, C., & Napoles, C. (2015). Problems in current text simplification research: New data can help. *Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics*, 3, 283–297.

- For the **Wikipedia Dataset**, while the paper does not provide a specific citation for the Wikipedia articles used, it references the Wiki-auto dataset, which can be cited as:
  > Jiang, C., Maddela, M., Lan, W., Zhong, Y., & Xu, W. (2020). Neural CRF model for sentence alignment in text simplification. In *Proceedings of the 58th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics*, pages 7943–7960.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture the datasets used in the research paper.
