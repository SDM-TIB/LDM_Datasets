To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Latent Dynamics via Invariant Decomposition and (Spatio-)Temporal Transformers" by Kai Lagemann et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and datasets sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets, which indicates that there are datasets to be identified.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. This section is crucial as it typically contains detailed descriptions of each dataset, including their characteristics and how they were generated or collected.

In section 4, the authors describe several datasets:

1. **Swinging Pendulum**: This dataset consists of synthetic videos of a nonlinear pendulum simulated in two spatial dimensions, governed by a second-order differential equation. The authors simulated 500 trajectories with varying initial conditions.

2. **Swinging Double Pendulum**: This dataset involves the kinematics of a nonlinear double pendulum motion, described by a set of ordinary differential equations. Similar to the first dataset, it includes 500 trajectories.

3. **Lambda-Omega Reaction-Diffusion System**: This dataset is based on a set of partial differential equations that generate spiral wave formations. The authors simulated this system over a spatial domain and generated 200 independent realizations.

4. **Two-Dimensional Wave Equation**: This dataset describes the propagation of waves and is governed by the wave equation. The authors generated 500 independent trajectories for this dataset.

5. **Navier-Stokes Equations**: This dataset simulates fluid flows governed by the Navier-Stokes equations, with 500 independent trajectories computed.

6. **Flow Around a Blunt Body**: This dataset captures the flow around a blunt cylinder, characterized by the formation of vortex patterns. The authors simulated this using a lattice-Boltzmann solver, resulting in 200 independent realizations.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations may not always be explicitly listed for datasets, but I will look for any relevant papers or sources mentioned in the context of each dataset.

For example, the authors might reference foundational papers or methodologies that describe the datasets or the equations governing them. If specific datasets are derived from well-known sources, I will include those citations as well.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset descriptions along with their full citations into a structured format for clarity and completeness.

In summary, my steps will be:
1. Read the abstract and introduction for initial dataset mentions.
2. Focus on section 4 for detailed dataset descriptions.
3. Check the references for full citations related to each dataset.
4. Compile the information into a clear and structured format for review.
