To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Back to the Future: Towards Explainable Temporal Reasoning with Large Language Models" by Chenhan Yuan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract mentions the introduction of a new dataset called **ExpTime**, which is a multi-source instruction-tuning dataset for explainable temporal reasoning. This is a strong indication that I need to gather more details about this dataset.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly the parts where the authors describe how the ExpTime dataset was constructed. They mention that it consists of 26,000 entries derived from temporal knowledge graph datasets and their reasoning paths. This section will provide insights into the sources of data used to create ExpTime.

In the **experiments section**, the authors discuss the datasets used for evaluation, specifically mentioning the **ICEWS14**, **ICEWS18**, and **ICEWS0515** datasets. These datasets are crucial for understanding the context in which the ExpTime dataset was developed and evaluated.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

1. **ExpTime Dataset**: Since this is a new dataset introduced in the paper, I will cite it as follows:
   > Chenhan Yuan, Qianqian Xie, Jimin Huang, and Sophia Ananiadou. *Back to the Future: Towards Explainable Temporal Reasoning with Large Language Models*. In Proceedings of the 61st Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers), pages 14820–14835, 2023.

2. **ICEWS14 Dataset**: The citation for this dataset is:
   > Alberto Garcia-Duran, Sebastijan Dumančić, and Mathias Niepert. *Learning Sequence Encoders for Temporal Knowledge Graph Completion*. In Proceedings of the 2018 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 4816–4821, 2018.

3. **ICEWS18 Dataset**: The citation is similar to ICEWS14:
   > Alberto Garcia-Duran, Sebastijan Dumančić, and Mathias Niepert. *Learning Sequence Encoders for Temporal Knowledge Graph Completion*. In Proceedings of the 2018 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 4816–4821, 2018.

4. **ICEWS0515 Dataset**: This dataset is also cited similarly:
   > Alberto Garcia-Duran, Sebastijan Dumančić, and Mathias Niepert. *Learning Sequence Encoders for Temporal Knowledge Graph Completion*. In Proceedings of the 2018 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 4816–4821, 2018.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations. This will ensure that I have a comprehensive overview of the datasets referenced in the paper, ready for further processing or review.
