To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Identifiability Guarantees for Causal Disentanglement from Soft Interventions" by Jiaqi Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the implementation of a causal disentanglement framework and mentions applying it to a real-world genomics dataset, which suggests that there may be specific datasets referenced later in the paper.

Next, I will examine the **methods** and **experiments** sections, as these typically contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used. In this paper, the authors mention applying their framework to the **Perturb-seq study** dataset, which is a significant clue that I need to follow up on.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide details about the dataset, stating that it contains **8,907 unperturbed cells** and **99,590 perturbed cells**. They also mention that the perturbed cells underwent **CRISPR activation** targeting one or two out of **105 genes**. This information is crucial for understanding the dataset's structure and purpose.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper cites the following:

1. **Perturb-seq study**:
   > Norman, T. M., Horlbeck, M. A., Replogle, J. M., Ge, A. Y., Xu, A., Jost, M., Gilbert, L. A., and Weissman, J. S. (2019). *Exploring genetic interaction manifolds constructed from rich single-cell phenotypes*. Science, 365(6455):786â€“793.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets in a structured manner, ensuring to include the full citations as required.

In conclusion, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its citation, ready for further processing or review.
