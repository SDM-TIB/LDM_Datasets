To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SentiCSE: A Sentiment-aware Contrastive Sentence Embedding Framework with Sentiment-guided Textual Similarity" by Jaemin Kim et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the evaluation of their method on sentiment analysis tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved. I will look for specific mentions of datasets in these sections.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experimental Settings)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they explicitly list the datasets employed, which include:

1. **IMDB**: A dataset for movie reviews, containing 25,000 training samples and 25,000 test samples.
2. **SST-2**: The Stanford Sentiment Treebank, with 67,349 training samples, 872 validation samples, and 1,821 test samples.
3. **Yelp-2**: A dataset from Yelp reviews, containing 160,000 training samples and 4,000 test samples.
4. **Amazon**: A dataset from Amazon reviews, with 560,000 training samples and 38,000 test samples.
5. **MR**: The Movie Review dataset, with 8,530 training samples, 1,066 validation samples, and 1,066 test samples.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. 

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will facilitate further research and validation of the findings presented in the paper.
