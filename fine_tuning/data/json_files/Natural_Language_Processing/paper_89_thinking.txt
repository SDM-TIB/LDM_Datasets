To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Poincaré Embeddings for Learning Hierarchical Representations" by Maximilian Nickel and Douwe Kiela, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of Poincaré embeddings on various tasks, which may imply the use of specific datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments** section. In this paper, the authors evaluate their method on tasks such as taxonomy embedding, link prediction, and lexical entailment, which typically require specific datasets.

In the **experiments section**, I will pay close attention to the descriptions of the tasks. For instance, the authors mention using the **WORDNET noun hierarchy** for embedding tasks, which is a well-known dataset. I will note down the details provided about this dataset, including its size and structure.

Additionally, the paper discusses experiments on **social networks** such as ASTROPH, CONDMAT, GRQC, and HEPPH. I will gather information about these datasets, including their characteristics and the context in which they were used.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with sources for further exploration.

The citations I will look for include:

1. **WORDNET**: The citation typically refers to the original work by George Miller and Christiane Fellbaum, which describes the WordNet lexical database.

2. **ASTROPH, CONDMAT, GRQC, HEPPH**: These datasets are often referenced in the context of social network analysis, and I will find the appropriate citations that describe their origins and usage.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details and that the citations are accurate and complete.
