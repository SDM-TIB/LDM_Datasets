To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Robust Pseudo-label Learning with Neighbor Relation for Unsupervised Visible-Infrared Person Re-Identification" by Xiangbo Yin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the experiments were conducted on two widely recognized benchmarks, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this case, the authors mention two datasets: **SYSU-MM01** and **RegDB**. I will note down their descriptions and any relevant details provided in the text.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide a detailed description of both datasets:

1. **SYSU-MM01**: This dataset is described as a large-scale benchmark for visible-infrared person re-identification, containing 491 identities captured across multiple RGB and infrared cameras. It includes 22,258 RGB images and 11,909 infrared images.

2. **RegDB**: This dataset consists of 4,120 RGB images and 4,120 infrared images, featuring 412 distinct identities, and is captured using a single RGB camera and a single infrared camera.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and will typically include the authors, title, conference or journal name, and publication year.

For **SYSU-MM01**, the citation is:
> Ancong Wu, Wei-Shi Zheng, Hong-Xing Yu, Shaogang Gong, and Jianhuang Lai. *RGB-Infrared Cross-Modality Person Re-identification*. In ICCV, pages 5390â€“5399, 2017.

For **RegDB**, the citation is:
> Dat Tien Nguyen, Hyung Gil Hong, Ki-Wan Kim, and Kang Ryoung Park. *Person Recognition System Based on a Combination of Body Images from Visible Light and Thermal Cameras*. Sensors, 17(3):605, 2017.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations as required. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details while extracting the datasets from the paper.
