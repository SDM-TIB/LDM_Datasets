To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning physics-based reduced models from data for the Hasegawa-Wakatani equations" by Constatin Gahr, Ionut-Gabriel Farcas, and Frank Jenko, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or data sources.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this paper, the authors mention using data obtained via a **Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS)** of the Hasegawa-Wakatani equations. This indicates that the dataset is derived from a simulation rather than a publicly available dataset.

I will also check the **numerical setup section** for details about the simulation parameters, including the size of the domain, time increments, and initial conditions. This information is crucial for understanding the dataset's context.

In the **data availability statement**, the authors mention that the high-fidelity simulation data were generated using the hw2d code, and they provide a link to the code repository. This is important for citation purposes, as it allows others to access the dataset.

Now, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format, ensuring that I include full citations for any datasets mentioned:

1. **Dataset from Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS)**:
   - Description: Data obtained from a high-fidelity simulation of the Hasegawa-Wakatani equations, focusing on two key quantities of interest: particle flux and resistive dissipation rate.
   - Citation: Greif, R. (2023). HW2D: A reference implementation of the Hasegawa-Wakatani model for plasma turbulence in fusion reactors. *Journal of Open Source Software*, 8(92), 5959. Available at: https://gitlab.mpcdf.mpg.de/cgahr/learning-roms-for-hw

After gathering this information, I will ensure that the dataset entries are clear and concise, ready for any further processing or review.
