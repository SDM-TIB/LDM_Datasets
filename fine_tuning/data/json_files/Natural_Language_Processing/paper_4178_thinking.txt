To extract datasets from the research paper titled "PALRACE: Reading Comprehension Dataset with Human Data and Labeled Rationales" by Jiajie Zou et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information accurately, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the introduction of a new dataset called **PALRACE**, which is a key indicator that I should focus on this dataset. The introduction further elaborates on the dataset's purpose and its components, confirming its significance.

Next, I will examine **section 2 (Dataset)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset. Here, they describe the dataset's collection process, the types of questions included, and the rationale annotation process. The dataset consists of **800 passages** selected from the **RACE dataset**, which is crucial to note.

In **subsection 2.1 (Dataset collection)**, the authors clarify that the passages and questions were selected from the **RACE dataset**, specifically targeting high-school level questions. This indicates that the **RACE dataset** is a foundational dataset for the PALRACE dataset.

I will also look for any additional datasets mentioned in the paper. In this case, the primary dataset is **PALRACE**, derived from **RACE**. The authors do not mention any other datasets explicitly, so I will focus on these two.

Now, I will gather the full citations for the datasets:

1. For **PALRACE**, the citation is:
   > Zou, J., Zhang, Y., Jin, P., Luo, C., Pan, X., & Ding, N. (2021). PALRACE: Reading Comprehension Dataset with Human Data and Labeled Rationales. In Proceedings of the ACL-IJCNLP 2021 Conference.

2. For **RACE**, the citation is:
   > Lai, G., Xie, Q., Liu, H., Yang, Y., & Hovy, E. (2017). RACE: Large-scale reading comprehension dataset from examinations. In Proceedings of the 2017 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), 785-794.

After compiling this information, I will ensure that I have accurately captured the essence of each dataset, including their purposes and characteristics, along with their full citations. This will allow me to present the datasets in a structured manner for further analysis or processing.
