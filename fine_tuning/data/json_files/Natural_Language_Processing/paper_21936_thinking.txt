To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Enhancing Fault Detection for Large Language Models via Mutation-Based Confidence Smoothing" by Qiang Hu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and the introduction typically outlines the context and significance of the research, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Empirical Study)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they describe four datasets:

1. **BigCloneBench Dataset**: Used for the Clone Detection (CD) task, which involves evaluating models on their ability to predict code clones. The authors mention that they randomly selected 200 items from this dataset.

2. **Java250 Dataset**: This dataset is part of the CodeNet Project and is used for the Problem Classification (PC) task. The authors selected 200 samples across 5 distinct problem types.

3. **IMDB Movie Reviews Dataset**: This dataset is used for the Sentiment Analysis task, where 150 samples were extracted to evaluate the sentiment of movie reviews.

4. **TagMyNews Dataset**: This dataset is used for the TagMyNews (TMN) task, where 200 articles were randomly selected from RSS feeds of popular newspapers.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
