To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Well Begun is Half Done: Generator-agnostic Knowledge Pre-Selection for Knowledge-Grounded Dialogue" by Lang Qin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract highlights the experimental results on knowledge selection methods, which suggests that datasets are involved in the evaluation of these methods.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, specifically **subsection 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention two datasets:

1. **Wizard of Wikipedia (WoW)**: This dataset consists of conversations where one participant (the wizard) selects knowledge from Wikipedia to respond to the other participant (the apprentice). The authors note that the dataset is split into Seen and Unseen categories based on topics.

2. **OpenDialKG**: This dataset is a parallel corpus that combines open-domain dialogues with a knowledge graph. It includes annotated reasoning paths for each turn, allowing participants to utilize graph information during conversations.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **Wizard of Wikipedia**, the citation is:
  > Emily Dinan, Stephen Roller, Kurt Shuster, Angela Fan, Michael Auli, and Jason Weston. *Wizard of Wikipedia: Knowledge-powered conversational agents*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR), 2019.

- For **OpenDialKG**, the citation is:
  > Seungwhan Moon, Pararth Shah, Anuj Kumar, and Rajen Subba. *OpenDialKG: Explainable conversational reasoning with attention-based walks over knowledge graphs*. In Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, pages 845â€“854, Florence, Italy, 2019.

Now that I have the dataset names and their full citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
