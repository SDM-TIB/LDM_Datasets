To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Modeling Multimodal Social Interactions: New Challenges and Baselines with Densely Aligned Representations" by Sangmin Lee et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors introduce new tasks and extensive data annotations, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Proposed Benchmark)**, where the authors discuss the datasets they are using. They mention extending two existing datasets for their research:

1. **YouTube Dataset**: This dataset consists of 151 games of One Night Ultimate Werewolf, collected from YouTube, totaling 14.8 hours of video. It includes videos, transcripts, player roles, voting outcomes, and persuasion strategy labels, with a total of 20,832 utterances.

2. **Ego4D Dataset**: This dataset is a subset of the Ego4D Social dataset and includes 40 games of One Night Ultimate Werewolf and 8 games of The Resistance: Avalon. It contains 101 videos with 7.3 hours of content, transcripts, player roles, voting outcomes, and persuasion strategy labels, totaling 5,815 utterances.

In the **experiments section**, the authors confirm that they used both the YouTube and Ego4D datasets for their evaluations, which reinforces their significance in the study.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For the **YouTube Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Lai, B., Liu, M., Ryan, F., & Rehg, J. M. (2023). Werewolf among us: Multimodal resources for modeling persuasion behaviors in social deduction games. In *Findings of the Association for Computational Linguistics*, pages 6570–6588.

- For the **Ego4D Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Grauman, K., Westbury, A., Byrne, E., Chavis, Z., Furnari, A., Girdhar, R., Hamburger, J., Jiang, H., Liu, M., et al. (2022). Ego4D: Around the world in 3,000 hours of egocentric video. In *IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition*, pages 18995–19012.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
