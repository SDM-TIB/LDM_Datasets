To extract datasets from the research paper titled "High Recall, Small Data: The Challenges of Within-System Evaluation in a Live Legal Search System" by Gineke Wiggers et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses challenges in evaluation methods for legal information retrieval and mentions using log data from a live legal search system and two user studies, which suggests that there may be datasets related to these studies.

Next, I will examine **section 4 (Assessment of applied evaluation methods)**, as it is likely to contain detailed descriptions of any datasets used in the evaluation of the legal search system. In this section, the authors mention an early precision golden data set known as the "golden answer set," which contains queries and their corresponding golden answers created by domain experts. This dataset is explicitly described, including its composition and limitations.

I will also look for any other datasets mentioned throughout the paper, particularly in sections discussing user studies or data collection methods. For instance, the paper discusses implicit feedback data collected from user interactions with the Legal Intelligence system, which may also be considered a dataset.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. The paper references various works, including those related to the creation of test collections and implicit feedback models, which may provide authoritative citations for the datasets.

For the identified datasets, I will ensure to note down the following details:
1. **Golden Answer Set**: This dataset contains 194 queries with corresponding golden answers created by legal domain experts.
   - Citation: Wiggers, G., Verberne, S., Zwenne, G.J. (2018). Exploration of Intrinsic Relevance Judgments by Legal Professionals in Information Retrieval Systems. In Proceedings of the 17th Dutch-Belgian Information Retrieval Workshop. Available at https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.04265.

2. **Implicit Feedback Data**: This dataset consists of user interaction logs from the Legal Intelligence system, capturing clicks and queries.
   - Citation: Van Opijnen, M. (2014). Op en in het web: Hoe de toegankelijkheid van rechterlijke uitspraken kan worden verbeterd. Dissertation, University of Amsterdam.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information and citations, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This systematic approach ensures that I accurately capture all relevant datasets and their citations from the research paper.
