To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Iterated INLA for State and Parameter Estimation in Nonlinear Dynamical Systems" by Rafael Anderka et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to find any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the methodology and results, which may include mentions of datasets used for validation or testing.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used in their evaluations. I will look for specific mentions of datasets, including their names, characteristics, and any relevant details about how they were used in the experiments.

In the **experiments section**, the authors describe several experiments, including the **Stochastic Nonlinear Pendulum**, **Burgers’ equation**, **Allen-Cahn equation**, and **Korteweg-de Vries equation**. Each of these experiments likely involves specific datasets or simulation setups that need to be documented.

For each experiment, I will extract the following information:

1. **Stochastic Nonlinear Pendulum**: The authors mention using a simulated trajectory of the pendulum system, which serves as the ground truth. I will note the parameters used for the simulation and any specific details about the observations taken from this simulation.

2. **Burgers’ Equation**: The authors describe generating ground truth data using a pseudospectral method of lines. I will extract the details about the initial conditions, parameters, and how observations were sampled from this ground truth.

3. **Allen-Cahn Equation**: Similar to the Burgers’ equation, I will document the ground truth simulation details and how observations were perturbed with noise.

4. **Korteweg-de Vries Equation**: I will extract the details about the ground truth simulation and the observations taken from it.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets or methodologies referenced in the paper. This may include foundational papers or datasets that the authors used as benchmarks.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will involve formatting the information clearly and accurately to reflect the datasets used in the experiments.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I comprehensively extract and document the datasets referenced in the paper, along with their full citations.
