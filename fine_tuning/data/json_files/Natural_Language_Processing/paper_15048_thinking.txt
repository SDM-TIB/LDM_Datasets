To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Will the Prince Get True Love’s Kiss? On the Model Sensitivity to Gender Perturbation over Fairytale Texts" by Christina Chance et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly referenced. The abstract mentions the use of **FairytaleQA dataset** for evaluating model robustness against gender perturbations, which indicates that this is a key dataset.

Next, I will look closely at the **introduction** where the authors discuss their focus on the FairytaleQA dataset and its relevance for assessing narrative comprehension in children. This section confirms that FairytaleQA is central to their research.

In the **methodology section**, particularly under the **Approaches & Evaluation** subsection, the authors detail their use of the FairytaleQA dataset for conducting experiments. They describe how they perform counterfactual data augmentation on this dataset to evaluate model sensitivity to gender perturbations.

I will also check the **experiments section** to see if there are any additional datasets mentioned or if there are variations of the FairytaleQA dataset used. However, the focus remains on FairytaleQA, and they describe how they augment this dataset using various methods.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citation for the FairytaleQA dataset. The relevant citation is:

- For **FairytaleQA**, the citation is:
  > Ying Xu, Dakuo Wang, Mo Yu, Daniel Ritchie, Bingsheng Yao, Tongshuang Wu, Zheng Zhang, Toby Li, Nora Bradford, Branda Sun, Tran Hoang, Yisi Sang, Yufang Hou, Xiaojuan Ma, Diyi Yang, Nanyun Peng, Zhou Yu, and Mark Warschauer. *Fantastic questions and where to find them: FairytaleQA – an authentic dataset for narrative comprehension*. In Proceedings of the 60th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers), pages 447–460, Dublin, Ireland, 2022. Association for Computational Linguistics.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry for FairytaleQA, ensuring to include the full citation as required. This will provide a clear and structured representation of the dataset used in the research.
