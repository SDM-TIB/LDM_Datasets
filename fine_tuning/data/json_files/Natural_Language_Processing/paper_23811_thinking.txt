To extract datasets from the research paper titled "URGENT Challenge: Universality, Robustness, and Generalizability for Speech Enhancement" by Wangyou Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors collected public speech and noise data from different domains, which suggests that there are specific datasets involved.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology and data sections** of the paper, particularly **Section 3 (Challenge Description)** and **Section 3.3 (Data)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention combining multiple public speech corpora, noise corpora, and room impulse response (RIR) samples.

In **Table 1**, the authors provide detailed information about the datasets used in their baseline experiments. The datasets mentioned include:

1. **LibriVox data from DNS5 challenge**: This dataset is used for training and validation, consisting of reading speech samples.
2. **LibriTTS**: Another reading speech dataset used in the experiments.
3. **CommonVoice 11.0**: The English portion of this dataset is noted but marked as not used in this paper.
4. **VCTK**: A reading speech dataset included in the training set.
5. **WSJ**: Another reading speech dataset, but not used in this paper.
6. **Audioset+FreeSound**: Noise data used in the DNS5 challenge.
7. **WHAM!**: A noise dataset mentioned in the context of the experiments.
8. **Simulated RIRs**: Room impulse responses used in the challenge.

For the **non-blind test set**, the authors mention adding additional unseen speech and noise corpora, as well as real recorded RIR samples.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to gather full citations for each dataset mentioned:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations.
