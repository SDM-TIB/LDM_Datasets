To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Cheating Suffix: Targeted Attack to Text-To-Image Diffusion Models with Multi-Modal Priors" by Dingcheng Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and while it may not explicitly mention datasets, it sets the context for the experiments conducted.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental results section (Section 4)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, the authors mention that they selected five object categories from the **COCO dataset** for their experiments. This indicates that the COCO dataset is a primary dataset used in their research.

I will also look for any additional datasets mentioned in the **methodology or related work sections**. However, the primary dataset appears to be the COCO dataset based on the information provided.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the COCO dataset. The citation for the COCO dataset is as follows:
> T.-Y. Lin, M. Maire, S. Belongie, J. Hays, P. Perona, D. Ramanan, P. Dollár, and C. L. Zitnick. *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. In Computer Vision–ECCV 2014: 13th European Conference, Zurich, Switzerland, September 6-12, 2014, Proceedings, Part V 13. Springer, 2014, pp. 740–755.

After confirming the dataset and its citation, I will compile this information into a structured format that highlights the dataset name, description, and citation.

In summary, the key steps I will take are:
1. Read through the abstract and introduction for context.
2. Focus on the experimental results section to identify datasets.
3. Confirm the dataset name (COCO) and check the references for the full citation.
4. Compile the dataset information for clarity and accuracy.

This systematic approach will ensure that I accurately extract and cite the datasets used in the research paper.
