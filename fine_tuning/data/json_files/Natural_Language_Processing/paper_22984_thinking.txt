To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Uncertainty Management in the Construction of Knowledge Graphs: a Survey" by Lucas Jarnac et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections. These sections often provide a high-level overview of the paper's focus and may mention key datasets used in the research. In this case, the abstract discusses knowledge graphs and their construction, but does not explicitly mention specific datasets.

Next, I will examine the **methodology and results sections**. These sections typically contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the research. I will look for any references to datasets, including their names, sizes, and any specific characteristics that are relevant to the study.

As I read through the paper, I will pay particular attention to any **figures, tables, or references** that may list datasets or provide additional context about them. For example, if the authors discuss specific knowledge graphs or datasets used for experiments, I will note these down.

In this paper, the authors mention several well-known knowledge graphs and datasets, such as:

1. **Wikidata**: A collaborative knowledge graph that serves as a multilingual general-purpose knowledge base.
   - Citation: Vrandecic, D., & Kr√∂tzsch, M. (2014). Wikidata: a free collaborative knowledgebase. *Communications of the ACM*, 57(10), 78-85. doi:10.1145/2623330.2623628.

2. **NELL (Never-Ending Language Learner)**: A system that continuously extracts knowledge from the web.
   - Citation: Carlson, A., Betteridge, J., Kisiel, B., Settles, B., & Etzioni, O. (2010). Toward an architecture for never-ending language learning. In *Proceedings of the Twenty-Fourth AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence* (pp. 1306-1313).

3. **YAGO**: An ontology built on statements from Wikipedia that combines high coverage with high quality.
   - Citation: Suchanek, F. M., Kasneci, G., & Weikum, G. (2007). Yago: a core of semantic knowledge. In *Proceedings of the 16th International Conference on World Wide Web* (pp. 697-706). doi:10.1145/1242572.1242667.

4. **DBpedia**: A knowledge base created by extracting structured information from Wikipedia.
   - Citation: Bizer, C., Lehmann, J., Kobilarov, G., Auer, S., Becker, C., Cyganiak, R., & Hellmann, S. (2009). DBpedia - A crystallization point for the Web of Data. *Journal of Web Semantics*, 7(3), 154-165. doi:10.1016/j.websem.2009.07.002.

5. **Freebase**: A large collaborative knowledge base that was acquired by Google.
   - Citation: Bollacker, K. D., Evans, C., Paritosh, P. K., Sturge, T., & Taylor, J. (2008). Freebase: a collaboratively created graph database for structuring human knowledge. In *Proceedings of the ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data* (pp. 1247-1250). doi:10.1145/1376616.1376746.

After identifying these datasets, I will ensure to compile the full citations accurately, as they are crucial for proper referencing in any subsequent work or analysis.

Finally, I will summarize the findings in a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly documented with its citation, ready for further processing or integration into a knowledge graph.
