To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Efficient Personalized Text-to-Image Generation by Leveraging Textual Subspace" by Shian Du et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of an input concept dataset, which suggests that datasets are involved. I will look for specific names or descriptions of datasets in these sections.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and any relevant details about their contents or characteristics.

In this paper, the authors mention using datasets from **Textual Inversion** and **Custom Diffusion**. I will note these datasets and any specific details provided about them, such as the number of images or types of concepts they contain.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets themselves.

For example, if the authors refer to the **LAION-400M dataset**, I will look for the citation:
> Christoph Schuhmann, Richard Vencu, Romain Beaumont, Robert Kaczmarczyk, Clayton Mullis, Aarush Katta, Theo Coombes, Jenia Jitsev, and Aran Komatsuzaki. *LAION-400M: Open dataset of CLIP-filtered 400 million image-text pairs*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2111.02114, 2021.

Similarly, I will find citations for any other datasets mentioned, ensuring that I capture the complete reference information.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, including their descriptions and citations, into a structured format that can be easily reviewed or processed further. This will ensure that all relevant information is organized and accessible.
