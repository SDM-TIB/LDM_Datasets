To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Visible-Thermal Tiny Object Detection: A Benchmark Dataset and Baselines" by Xinyi Ying et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any datasets that are introduced or referenced. The abstract mentions the creation of a large-scale benchmark dataset called **RGBT-Tiny**, which is a strong indication that this is a primary dataset discussed in the paper.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for further details about the datasets. Here, the authors describe the challenges in small object detection and highlight the need for a dataset that encompasses both visible and thermal modalities. They specifically mention the **RGBT-Tiny** dataset, which is designed to address these challenges.

I will then look into the **related work** section to see if the authors reference any existing datasets that influenced their work. They discuss various RGBT datasets but emphasize that none provide a comprehensive benchmark for multi-category visible-thermal small object detection.

In the **dataset section** (which appears to be section 3), the authors provide detailed information about the **RGBT-Tiny** dataset. They describe its composition, including:
- 115 paired sequences
- 93,000 frames
- 1.2 million manual annotations
- 7 target categories
- 8 types of scenes

This section confirms that **RGBT-Tiny** is the main dataset used in their experiments.

Next, I will check the **experiments** section to see if any other datasets are mentioned or used for comparison. The authors primarily focus on the **RGBT-Tiny** dataset for their evaluations, which reinforces its significance.

Finally, I will consult the **references section** to gather full citations for the datasets mentioned. Since the **RGBT-Tiny** dataset is newly introduced in this paper, it may not have a separate citation in the references. However, I will ensure to note any other datasets referenced in the context of related work.

The full citation for the **RGBT-Tiny** dataset, as it is presented in the paper, is:
> Ying, X., Xiao, C., Li, R., He, X., Li, B., Li, Z., Wang, Y., Hu, M., Xu, Q., Lin, Z., Li, M., Zhou, S., An, W., Sheng, W., & Liu, L. (2023). Visible-Thermal Tiny Object Detection: A Benchmark Dataset and Baselines. *[arXiv preprint arXiv:XXXX.XXXX]*.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format that captures the dataset details and citations accurately.
