To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Adaptive Critical Subgraph Mining for Cognitive Impairment Conversion Prediction with T1-MRI-based Brain Network" by Yilin Leng et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the study utilizes data from the **Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI)**, which indicates that this is a key dataset for the research.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **Methods section**. Here, the authors describe the data used for their experiments, specifically mentioning three publicly available databases: **ADNI-1**, **ADNI-2**, and **National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center (NACC)**. This confirms that these datasets are integral to the study.

In the **Experiments section**, the authors provide demographic details about the subjects from these datasets, which further validates their use. They mention the number of subjects categorized into different groups (e.g., sMCI, pMCI, sNC, pNC) across the datasets, which is crucial for understanding the context of the data.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset from the **References section**:

1. **Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI-1)**:
   > Petersen, R. C., Aisen, P. S., Beckett, L. A., Donohue, M. C., Gamst, A. C., Harvey, D. J., Jack, C. R., Jagust, W. J., Shaw, L. M., Toga, A. W., et al. (2010). Alzheimer's clinical neuroimaging initiative: Characterization. *Neurology*, 74(3), 201-209.

2. **Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI-2)**:
   > Besser, L., Kukull, W., Knopman, D. S., Chui, H., Galasko, D., Weintraub, S., Jicha, G., Carlsson, C., Burns, J., Quinn, J., et al. (2018). Version 3 of the national Alzheimer’s coordinating center’s uniform data set. *Alzheimer Disease & Associated Disorders*, 32(4), 351-358.

3. **National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center (NACC)**:
   > Besser, L., Kukull, W., Knopman, D. S., Chui, H., Galasko, D., Weintraub, S., Jicha, G., Carlsson, C., Burns, J., Quinn, J., et al. (2018). Version 3 of the national Alzheimer’s coordinating center’s uniform data set. *Alzheimer Disease & Associated Disorders*, 32(4), 351-358.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations.
