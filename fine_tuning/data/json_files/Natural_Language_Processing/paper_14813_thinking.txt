To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Typing to Listen at the Cocktail Party: Text-Guided Target Speaker Extraction" by Xiang Hao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their full citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental evaluation sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the development of a model for target speaker extraction (TSE) and hints at the use of datasets for experiments. This suggests that datasets will be discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experimental Evaluation)**, particularly **subsection 4.1 (Overlapped Speech Simulation)**, where the authors explicitly mention two datasets used for their experiments:

1. **LibriSpeech**: This dataset is described as a 1000-hour corpus of English audiobook speech, known for its diverse speaker identities. It is essential to note that the authors adhere to the standard training, validation, and test set division of this dataset.

2. **Multilingual LibriSpeech (MLS)**: This is an extension of the LibriSpeech dataset that includes multiple languages such as French, German, and Spanish. The authors mention that they randomly selected 400 speakers per language from MLS for their experiments.

In the same section, the authors provide details on how they utilized these datasets, including the selection of speakers and utterances, which confirms their relevance to the study.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **LibriSpeech**, the citation is:
  > Vassil Panayotov, Guoguo Chen, Daniel Povey, and Sanjeev Khudanpur. *Librispeech: An ASR corpus based on public domain audio books*. In 2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP), pp. 5206–5210, South Brisbane, Queensland, Australia, April 2015.

- For **Multilingual LibriSpeech (MLS)**, the citation is:
  > Vineel Pratap, Qiantong Xu, Anuroop Sriram, Gabriel Synnaeve, and Ronan Collobert. *MLS: A Large-Scale Multilingual Dataset for Speech Research*. In Interspeech 2020, pp. 2757–2761, October 2020.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets and their citations clearly.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that is ready for review or further processing.
