To extract datasets from the research paper titled "PIVOINE: Instruction Tuning for Open-world Information Extraction" by Keming Lu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections for any mentions of datasets. The abstract mentions the construction of **INSTRUCTOPENWIKI**, which is described as a substantial instruction tuning dataset for Open-world Information Extraction. This indicates that there is at least one dataset to extract.

Next, I will look into the **Methods** section, specifically **section 3.3 (Instruction Dataset Construction)**, where the authors detail how **INSTRUCTOPENWIKI** was created. They describe it as being built through weak supervision by aligning anchor links in Wikipedia to entity profiles in Wikidata. This section provides valuable insights into the dataset's structure and purpose.

In the **Appendix B (Dataset Statistics)**, the authors provide detailed statistics about **INSTRUCTOPENWIKI**, including the number of articles, mentions, triplets, and entities. This reinforces the significance of this dataset in their research.

Now, I will compile the full citation for the dataset mentioned:

- **INSTRUCTOPENWIKI**: The citation for this dataset is not explicitly provided in the references section, but it is derived from the paper itself. Therefore, I will cite it as follows:
  > Lu, K., Pan, X., Song, K., Zhang, H., Yu, D., & Chen, J. (2023). *PIVOINE: Instruction Tuning for Open-world Information Extraction*. In Proceedings of the [Conference Name], [Location], [Date]. 

Since the paper does not specify a conference name or location, I will leave placeholders for those details.

Finally, I will summarize the findings in a structured format, ensuring that the dataset name, description, and citation are clearly documented. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the dataset extracted from the paper.
