To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MIXTURE-OF-SKILLS: Learning to Optimize Data Usage for Fine-Tuning Large Language Models" by Minghao Wu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments using "two widely used benchmarks," which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4) where the authors describe their experimental setup. In **Section 4.1 (Experimental Setup)**, they mention collecting supervised fine-tuning (SFT) datasets for four distinct skills: Mathematics, Medicine, General, and NLP. This section is crucial as it explicitly lists the datasets used.

The paper provides specific references for each dataset in the **Training Datasets** subsection:

1. **Mathematics Dataset**: The authors refer to the MathInstruct dataset introduced by Yue et al. (2023). The citation is:
   > Yue, Z., Zhang, Y., Li, J., Chen, L., & Wang, H. (2023). *MathInstruct: A comprehensive collection of mathematical SFT datasets*. Available at: https://huggingface.co/datasets/TIGER-Lab/MathInstruct.

2. **Medicine Dataset**: The authors mention the MedInstruct dataset introduced by Zhang et al. (2023a). The citation is:
   > Zhang, C., Martin, C., & Wang, H. (2023a). *MedInstruct: A medical SFT dataset*. Available at: https://huggingface.co/datasets/casey-martin/MedInstruct.

3. **General Dataset**: The ShareGPT dataset is referenced as a general SFT dataset. The citation is:
   > ShareGPT. (2023). *ShareGPT: A diverse dataset contributed by the general public*. Available at: https://huggingface.co/datasets/anon8231489123/ShareGPT_Vicuna_unfiltered.

4. **NLP Dataset**: The authors refer to the P3 dataset introduced by Sanh et al. (2022). The citation is:
   > Sanh, V., Webson, A., Raffel, C., & others. (2022). *P3: A collection of prompted English datasets covering a diverse set of NLP tasks*. Available at: https://huggingface.co/datasets/bigscience/P3.

After identifying these datasets and their citations, I will ensure that I have accurately captured the details and formatted them correctly for any further processing or output.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ready for review or downstream processing.
