To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Whatâ€™s my role? Modelling responsibility for AI-based safety-critical systems" by Philippa Ryan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections detailing the examples** (specifically sections 4 and 5) to identify any datasets that are explicitly referenced. The abstract provides a general overview, but the introduction and example sections are likely to contain specific mentions of datasets used in the analysis.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss AI-based safety-critical systems and their implications, but they do not mention specific datasets. Therefore, I will move on to the **examples** presented in sections 4 and 5.

In **section 4**, which discusses the fatal collision involving an autonomous vehicle in Tempe, Arizona, the authors reference the **National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) accident report** as a source of information. This report may contain relevant data, but it is not a dataset in the traditional sense. I will note this reference for context.

In **section 5**, the authors describe the AI-based diabetes co-morbidity predictor (DCP) and mention the use of a **training patient database**. However, they do not provide a specific citation for this dataset, nor do they detail its origin or structure. This indicates that while they reference a dataset, they do not provide a formal citation.

Next, I will check the **References section** to see if any datasets are cited there. The references include various sources, but they primarily focus on literature and reports rather than specific datasets. 

After reviewing the entire paper, it appears that while the authors discuss the use of datasets conceptually (like the training patient database), they do not provide formal citations for any specific datasets used in their analysis. Therefore, I will summarize my findings as follows:

1. **National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) accident report**: This report is referenced in section 4 but is not a dataset in the traditional sense. It provides context for the analysis of the Tempe incident.
   - Citation: National Transportation Safety Board. 2019. Collision Between Vehicle Controlled by Developmental Automated Driving System and Pedestrian, Tempe, Arizona, March 18, 2018, NTSB/HAR-19/03. https://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/accidentreports/reports/har1903.pdf

2. **Training patient database**: Mentioned in section 5 as a resource for the diabetes co-morbidity predictor, but no specific citation or details are provided.
   - No formal citation available.

In conclusion, I will document the findings regarding the datasets, noting the lack of formal citations for the training patient database while providing the citation for the NTSB report. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the relevant information from the paper.
