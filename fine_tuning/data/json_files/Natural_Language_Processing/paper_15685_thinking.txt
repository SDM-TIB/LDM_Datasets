To extract datasets from the research paper titled "End-to-End Assessment of AR-Assisted Neurosurgery Systems" by Mahdi Bagheri et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their full citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a general overview, but I need to look for specific datasets in the later sections where methodologies and experiments are discussed.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss various challenges in AR-assisted neurosurgery but do not mention specific datasets. I will move on to the **methods section**, where the authors describe their experimental setup. Here, they mention using **multiple Vicon cameras** for tracking and **retroreflective markers** for localization, which suggests that they may have collected data from these experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **results section**. The authors present results related to the accuracy of sphere center estimation and transformation errors, indicating that they have collected quantitative data from their experiments. They mention three sets of data collected for each experiment type (physical, holographic, and no feedback), which implies that there are datasets associated with these experiments.

Now, I will look for specific references to datasets or data collection methods. The authors refer to **14 retroreflective spheres** used in their experiments, which indicates that they have a dataset related to these spheres. However, they do not provide a formal dataset name or citation in the text.

To ensure I have the correct citations, I will check the **References section** for any papers that might describe the datasets or methods used. I will look for papers that discuss the Vicon tracking system or any other external devices mentioned, as these may provide the necessary context or datasets.

After reviewing the references, I find that the authors cite several studies related to AR and tracking systems, but they do not provide specific dataset citations. Therefore, I will summarize the datasets based on the information provided in the paper:

1. **Vicon Tracking Data**: This dataset includes data collected from the Vicon cameras used for tracking retroreflective markers during the experiments. The specific details of this dataset, such as the number of trials or the format of the data, are not explicitly mentioned in the paper.

2. **CT Scan Data**: The authors mention using CT scans to measure the accuracy of the probe tip and fiducials. This dataset includes images and measurements obtained from the CT scans used in the experiments.

3. **Experimental Results Data**: The results presented in Table 2 summarize the errors and standard deviations for the different feedback conditions (no feedback, holographic feedback, and physical feedback). This dataset includes quantitative results from the experiments.

Since the paper does not provide formal citations for these datasets, I will note that the datasets are derived from the authors' experimental work and the methodologies described in the paper.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include any relevant details and context for each dataset, even if formal citations are not available. This will help in understanding the datasets' origins and their relevance to the research conducted.
