To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MindTheDApp: A Toolchain for Complex Network-Driven Structural Analysis of Ethereum-based Decentralised Applications" by Giacomo Ibba et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions a toolchain designed for structural analysis and highlights the creation of a dataset of decentralized applications (DApps), which indicates that there is a dataset to extract.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors discuss the importance of analyzing Solidity smart contracts and the contributions of their toolchain. They mention that the dataset spans various categories, which suggests that it is well-defined and categorized.

In the **methodology section**, the authors describe how they collected data from 26 DApps, which is crucial information. They specify that the dataset includes 3,093 smart contracts and provides a detailed look into the complex networks of smart contract interactions. This section will help me understand the structure and content of the dataset.

Then, I will check the **results section**, particularly where they summarize the dataset in Table 1. This table provides key information about the DApps included in the dataset, such as their names, categories, number of smart contracts, and other relevant metrics. This is essential for accurately describing the dataset.

Now, I will gather the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper does not provide a separate reference for the dataset itself, but it does reference the DAppScan dataset, which is used for evaluation. The citation for the DAppScan dataset is:

- For **DAppScan dataset**, the citation is:
  > DAppScan. *A curated repository built to assess the performances of smart contracts vulnerability detection tools*. Available at: https://github.com/InPlusLab/DAppSCAN.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the relevant details such as the number of contracts, categories, and other metrics as described in the paper. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the dataset extracted from the research paper.
