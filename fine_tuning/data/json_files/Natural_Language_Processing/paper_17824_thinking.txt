To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Epidemiological dynamics in populations structured by neighbourhoods and households" by Abby Barlow, Ben Adams, and Sarah Penington, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the research, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets in the **methods or results sections**. These sections typically contain detailed descriptions of the data used for analysis, including any datasets that were collected or utilized in the study. I will pay close attention to any tables or figures that may summarize data or provide references to datasets.

If the paper discusses specific datasets, I will note their names and any relevant details provided, such as the number of observations, variables included, and the context in which the data was collected.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** for full citations. This is crucial as it allows me to provide accurate and complete citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. I will ensure that I capture all necessary details such as authors, title, publication venue, and year.

If the paper does not provide full citations directly, I may need to conduct a brief search for the datasets online to find their original sources and ensure I have the correct citation format.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and accompanied by its full citation. This will allow for easy reference and further analysis.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and cite the datasets used in the research paper.
