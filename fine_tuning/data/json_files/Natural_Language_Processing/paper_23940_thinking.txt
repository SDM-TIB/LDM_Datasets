To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Site-Specific Radio Channel Representation - Current State and Future Applications" by Thomas Zemen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections discussing methodologies and applications** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a general overview of the site-specific radio channel representation (SSCR) but does not explicitly mention datasets. Therefore, I will focus on the **introduction** and subsequent sections for more detailed information.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of SSCR for various applications, but again, no specific datasets are mentioned. I will proceed to the **methodology and model type sections**, where the authors describe different modeling approaches, including ray tracing and quasi-deterministic models. Here, I will look for any references to datasets used for validation or model training.

As I continue through the paper, I will pay special attention to any **figures, tables, or references** that might indicate the use of specific datasets. For example, in the **model validation section**, the authors mention empirical radio channel measurements and categorize them into large-scale, medium-scale, and small-scale measurements. This suggests that there may be datasets associated with these measurements.

Next, I will check the **references section** for any cited datasets or studies that may have provided data for the research. The authors reference various studies and reports, which could lead to datasets relevant to their work.

Upon reviewing the references, I find that the authors cite several works that may contain datasets. For instance, they reference empirical studies on vehicular channels and urban cellular environments, which likely include datasets used for their analyses.

I will compile the identified datasets and their citations as follows:

1. **Empirical Radio Channel Measurements**: The paper discusses the need for extensive field measurements for model validation, but it does not provide specific dataset names. However, it references:
   - L. Bernadó et al. (2014). "Delay and Doppler spreads of non-stationary vehicular channels for safety relevant scenarios." IEEE Trans. Veh. Technol., vol. 63, no. 1, pp. 82–93.
   - R. He et al. (2022). "5G for railways: Next generation railway dedicated communications." IEEE Commun. Mag., vol. 60, no. 12, pp. 130–136.

2. **Quasi-Deterministic Channel Model**: The authors mention a quasi-deterministic environment model for vehicular scenarios, which is validated with empirical measurements. The reference for this model is:
   - A. Dakić et al. (2024). "Wireless V2X communication testbed for connected, cooperative and automated mobility." IEEE Veh. Networking Conf. (VNC), Kobe, Japan.

3. **AI/ML-Based Channel Modeling**: The authors discuss AI/ML-based approaches for channel modeling, referencing:
   - C. Huang et al. (2022). "Artificial intelligence enabled radio propagation for communications — Part II: Scenario identification and channel modeling." IEEE Trans. Antennas Propag., vol. 70, no. 6, pp. 3955–3969.

After gathering this information, I will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets and their full citations. This will involve cross-referencing the citations with the original papers to confirm their relevance and completeness.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for further processing, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited according to the standards required.
