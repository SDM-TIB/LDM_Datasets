To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A hierarchical control framework for autonomous decision-making systems: Integrating HMDP and MPC" by Xue-Fang Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will look for any references to datasets used in the experiments or simulations.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 5) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for validation. I will look for specific mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and any relevant details about their structure or content.

In this paper, the authors discuss an application scenario involving an **autonomous lane changing system**. I will check if they reference any specific datasets related to this application, such as traffic scenarios or vehicle dynamics data.

After identifying potential datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for the datasets used in the research.

If the paper does not explicitly mention datasets, I will look for any supplementary materials or appendices that might contain additional information about the datasets used in the experiments.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each entry is complete and accurately reflects the content of the paper.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring that I have included all relevant information for each dataset identified in the paper.
