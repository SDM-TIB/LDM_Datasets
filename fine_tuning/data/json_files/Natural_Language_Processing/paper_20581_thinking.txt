To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Bag of Tricks for Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning" by Shuvendu Roy et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the datasets used in the experiments. The abstract mentions that the authors perform extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets: **CIFAR-100**, **CUB-200**, and **miniImageNet**. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for the research.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section**, specifically **section 4.1**, where the authors provide details about the datasets used. Here, they explicitly list the datasets:

1. **CIFAR-100**: A dataset consisting of 100 classes, where the authors use 60 classes for the base session and the remaining 40 classes for incremental sessions.
2. **CUB-200**: A dataset with 200 fine-grained categories, where 100 classes are used for the base session and the remaining 100 for incremental sessions.
3. **miniImageNet**: A subset of the ImageNet dataset containing 100 classes, with a similar session structure as CIFAR-100.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **CIFAR-100**, the citation is:
  > Krizhevsky, A., Hinton, G., et al. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. 2009.

- For **CUB-200**, the citation is:
  > Wah, C., Branson, S., Welinder, P., Perona, P., Belongie, S. *The Caltech-UCSD Birds-200-2011 dataset*. 2011.

- For **miniImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Vinyals, O., Blundell, C., Lillicrap, T., et al. *Matching Networks for One Shot Learning*. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 2016.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
