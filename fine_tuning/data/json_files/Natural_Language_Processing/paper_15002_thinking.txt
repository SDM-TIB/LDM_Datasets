To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Personalization of CTC-Based End-to-End Speech Recognition Using Pronunciation-Driven Subword Tokenization" by Zhihong Lei et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, approach, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the challenges of recognizing personal content in speech recognition, which may imply the use of specific datasets for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors highlight the importance of personal named entities in automatic speech recognition (ASR) applications. They mention that ASR systems are often adapted to particular users, which suggests that they may have used datasets related to user-specific data.

In the **experiments section**, particularly **section 4.1**, the authors describe the models and test sets used for their experiments. They mention that they conducted experiments on a voice assistant task in three languages: American English, Chinese Mandarin, and German. They provide statistics about the test sets, which include anonymized, human-annotated utterances sampled from virtual assistant queries. This indicates that the datasets used for testing are likely proprietary or internal datasets related to voice assistant queries.

I will also look for any specific dataset names or references in the **related work** section, as authors often cite datasets used in previous studies. However, in this case, it appears that the focus is more on methodologies rather than specific datasets.

Finally, I will check the **references section** for any citations that may correspond to datasets or methodologies that involve datasets. The references include various works related to speech recognition and contextual biasing, but they do not explicitly mention datasets.

Based on my review, it seems that the paper does not provide specific dataset names or external datasets used for evaluation. Instead, it relies on internal datasets for testing, which may not have publicly available citations.

In conclusion, I will summarize my findings regarding the datasets mentioned in the paper, noting that while the authors discuss their experiments and methodologies, they do not provide specific external datasets or citations. If any datasets were mentioned, I would ensure to include their full citations as required. However, in this case, it appears that the datasets are not explicitly named or cited in the paper.
