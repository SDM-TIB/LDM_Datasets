To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Style-News: Incorporating Stylized News Generation and Adversarial Verification for Neural Fake News Detection" by Wei-Yao Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's focus on neural fake news and mentions the use of a public dataset, which indicates that datasets are likely discussed in detail later.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments and Analysis)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention two primary datasets:

1. **CNN/DailyMail Dataset**: This dataset is used for synthetic news generation and publisher prediction. The authors note that it contains over 300,000 unique news articles and highlights sentences.

2. **All the News Dataset**: This dataset is also used for synthetic news generation and publisher prediction. It encompasses 143,000 articles from various American publishers.

Additionally, they mention a third dataset:

3. **VOA-KG2txt Dataset**: This dataset is utilized for neural fake news detection. It includes 15,000 real news articles from Voice of America and 15,000 machine-generated articles.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The citations I will extract are:

- For the **CNN/DailyMail Dataset**:
  > Hermann, K., Kociský, T., Grefenstette, E., Espeholt, L., Kay, W., Suleyman, M., & Blunsom, P. (2015). Teaching machines to read and comprehend. In NIPS, pages 1693–1701.

- For the **All the News Dataset**:
  > Thompson, A. (2018). All the news dataset. Retrieved from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/snapcrack/all-the-news.

- For the **VOA-KG2txt Dataset**:
  > Fung, Y., Thomas, C., Gangi Reddy, R., Polisetty, S., Ji, H., Chang, S.-F., McKeown, K. R., Bansal, M., & Sil, A. (2021). Infosurgeon: Cross-media fine-grained information consistency checking for fake news detection. In ACL/IJCNLP (1), pages 1683–1698.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This systematic approach ensures that I have accurately captured all relevant datasets and their citations from the paper.
