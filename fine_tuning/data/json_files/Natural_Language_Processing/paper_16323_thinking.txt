To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Do VSR Models Generalize Beyond LRS3?" by Yasser Abdelaziz Dahou Djilali et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the **Lip Reading Sentences-3 (LRS3)** benchmark and introduces a new test set called **WildVSR**. This indicates that both datasets are significant for the research.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **Datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **Methods** or **Experiments** sections. In the introduction, the authors discuss the limitations of the LRS3 dataset and the creation of the WildVSR dataset, which suggests that both datasets will be described in detail later in the paper.

Upon reaching the **Datasets** section, I find explicit descriptions of both datasets:

1. **Lip Reading Sentences-3 (LRS3)**: This dataset is widely used in visual speech recognition and consists of video clips with corresponding transcriptions. It has been a benchmark for evaluating VSR models.

2. **WildVSR**: This is a new dataset created by the authors to address the limitations of LRS3. It includes a more diverse set of visual speech data, with a total of 4.8 hours of video and 2,854 utterances from 478 YouTube videos.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **LRS3**, the citation is:
  > Triantafyllos Afouras, Joon Son Chung, and Andrew Zisserman. *LRS3-TED: A Large-Scale Dataset for Visual Speech Recognition*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1809.00496, 2018.

- For **WildVSR**, since it is a new dataset introduced in this paper, I will cite it as follows:
  > Yasser Abdelaziz Dahou Djilali, Sanath Narayan, Eustache Le Bihan, Haithem Boussaid, Ebtessam Almazrouei, Merouane Debbah. *Do VSR Models Generalize Beyond LRS3?* Technology Innovation Institute, UAE, 2023.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
