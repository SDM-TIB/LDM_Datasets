To extract datasets from the research paper titled "THRONE: An Object-based Hallucination Benchmark for the Free-form Generations of Large Vision-Language Models" by Prannay Kaul et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their framework using public datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Implementation)**, where the authors discuss the datasets used for their evaluations. Here, they explicitly mention using the **COCO dataset** for evaluating Type I hallucinations. The authors describe the COCO dataset as containing 80 categories with exhaustive annotations at the image level, which is crucial for their evaluation framework.

Additionally, they mention using the **Objects365 dataset** to demonstrate the generality of their framework. This dataset is noted for its larger vocabulary and is not used in the training of the LVLMs they evaluate.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **COCO dataset**, the citation is:
   > Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, Serge Belongie, James Hays, Pietro Perona, Deva Ramanan, Piotr DollÃ¡r, and C Lawrence Zitnick. *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. In Proceedings of the European Conference on Computer Vision, 2014.

2. For the **Objects365 dataset**, the citation is:
   > Shuai Shao, Zeming Li, Tianyuan Zhang, Chao Peng, Gang Yu, Xiangyu Zhang, Jing Li, and Jian Sun. *Objects365: A Large-scale, High-quality Dataset for Object Detection*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Computer Vision, 2019.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets in a clear format, ensuring that I include the full citations as they are critical for proper attribution and further research.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that can be easily reviewed or processed further.
