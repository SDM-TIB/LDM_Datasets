To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CD-COCO: A Versatile Complex Distorted COCO Database for Scene-Context-Aware Computer Vision" by Ayman Beghdadi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant details, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any mention of datasets. The abstract indicates that a new database has been built from the well-known MS-COCO database, which suggests that this is a primary dataset of interest.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for further context about the dataset. The authors discuss the importance of making databases available for the scientific community and mention the creation of a novel distorted image database derived from MS-COCO. This reinforces the significance of the MS-COCO dataset in their work.

Moving on to **section IV (Dataset)**, I will find detailed information about the dataset. The authors specify that the generated dataset consists of over 123,000 images with 80 object classes, organized into training, validation, and test sets. This section provides crucial details about the dataset's structure and content.

The paper also mentions that the dataset includes various distortion types, which are categorized into global and local distortions. This information is essential for understanding the dataset's purpose and application in computer vision tasks.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citation for the MS-COCO dataset, as it is the foundational dataset for the new database created by the authors. The citation for the MS-COCO dataset is:

- For **MS-COCO Dataset**:
  > Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, Sergio F. Gonzalez, et al. *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. In European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), 2014.

Since the authors have created a new dataset based on MS-COCO, I will also note that the new dataset is referred to as "CD-COCO" but does not have a separate citation since it is derived from MS-COCO.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citation for the MS-COCO dataset as it is crucial for proper attribution. This will prepare me to present the dataset information in a structured format for further use or analysis.
