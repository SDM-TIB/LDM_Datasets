To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Group Symmetric Stochastic Differential Equation Model for Molecule Multi-modal Pretraining" by Shengchao Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions "molecule pretraining" and references "a large number of molecule datasets," which indicates that datasets are likely discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 1 (Introduction)**, where the authors reference several datasets used in molecule pretraining. They specifically mention the **PCQM4Mv2 dataset** as the primary dataset for pretraining, which is a sub-dataset of PubChemQC.

In **section 5 (Experiments)**, the authors provide more details about the datasets used for pretraining and downstream tasks. They confirm that they used **PCQM4Mv2** for pretraining and also mention **Molecule3D**, which is another dataset they considered but ultimately did not use due to mismatches between 2D topologies and 3D conformations.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. **PCQM4Mv2**: The citation is:
   > Hu, W., Fey, M., Zitnik, M., Dong, Y., Ren, H., Liu, B., Catasta, M., and Leskovec, J. *Open Graph Benchmark: Datasets for Machine Learning on Graphs*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2005.00687, 2020a.

2. **Molecule3D**: The citation is:
   > Xu, Z., Luo, Y., Zhang, X., Xu, X., Xie, Y., Liu, M., Dickerson, K., Deng, C., Nakata, M., and Ji, S. *Molecule3D: A Benchmark for Predicting 3D Geometries from Molecular Graphs*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2110.01717, 2021b.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets extracted:

- **PCQM4Mv2**: A dataset with 3.4 million molecules, used for molecule pretraining.
- **Molecule3D**: A dataset extracted from PubChemQC, which was considered but not used due to mismatches.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for clarity and future reference. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
