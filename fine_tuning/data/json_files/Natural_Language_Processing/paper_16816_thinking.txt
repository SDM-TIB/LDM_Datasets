To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Model-Based Epistemic Variance of Values for Risk-Aware Policy Optimization" by Carlos E. Luis et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a concise overview of the research and may mention datasets used for experiments. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets, while the methodology and experiments sections typically detail the datasets used for validation and testing.

In the **introduction**, I will look for any references to datasets that the authors might have used to evaluate their proposed methods. If the authors mention specific datasets or benchmarks, I will note them down.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, which is likely to contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the experiments. I will look for any subsections specifically dedicated to datasets or data collection. Here, I will identify the names of the datasets, their characteristics, and any relevant statistics provided by the authors.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. I will ensure that I capture the authors, title, publication venue, and year for each dataset.

For example, if the authors mention using the **D4RL benchmark**, I will look for its citation in the references. The citation might look something like this:
> J. Fu, A. Kumar, O. Nachum, G. Tucker, and S. Levine. "D4RL: Datasets for Deep Data-Driven Reinforcement Learning." 2020.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that I maintain clarity and accuracy in the documentation.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for easy reference and potential downstream processing, ensuring that each dataset is clearly identified and properly cited.
