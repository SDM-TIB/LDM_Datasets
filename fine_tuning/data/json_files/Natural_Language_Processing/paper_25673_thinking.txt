To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Spatiotemporal Graph Guided Multi-modal Network for Livestreaming Product Retrieval" by Xiaowan Hu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions the challenges of livestreaming product retrieval and hints at the datasets used for evaluation. The introduction will provide context and possibly mention specific datasets that are central to the research.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors explicitly mention two datasets: **LPR4M** and **MovingFashion (MF)**. I will note down the details provided for each dataset, including their characteristics, such as the number of categories, pairs, and modalities.

In the **experiments section**, the authors describe how they conducted their evaluations using these datasets. This section will confirm the datasets' relevance and provide additional context on their use in the experiments.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and will help in understanding the datasets' origins and their significance in the field.

For the **LPR4M dataset**, the citation is:
> Wenjie Yang, Yiyi Chen, Yan Li, Yanhua Cheng, Xudong Liu, Quan Chen, and Han Li. *Cross-view Semantic Alignment for Livestreaming Product Recognition*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2308.04912, 2023.

For the **MovingFashion (MF) dataset**, the citation is:
> Marco Godi, Christian Joppi, Geri Skenderi, and Marco Cristani. *Moving-Fashion: a Benchmark for the Video-to-Shop Challenge*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision, pages 1678â€“1686, 2022.

After gathering all this information, I will summarize the datasets, including their characteristics and full citations, ensuring that I maintain clarity and accuracy in the descriptions. This structured approach will help in creating a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
