To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DMOFC: Discrimination Metric-Optimized Feature Compression" by Changsheng Gao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, method, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, but I will need to delve deeper into the main sections for specific dataset mentions.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of feature compression in machine vision but do not explicitly mention datasets. I will continue to the **method section**, where they describe their approach and any datasets used for training or evaluation.

In **section III (Experiments)**, the authors specify the datasets used for their experiments:

1. **CASIA-WebFace Dataset**: This dataset is used for training in the face verification task. It is a well-known dataset for face recognition tasks.

2. **Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) Dataset**: This dataset is used for evaluating the model in the face verification task. It is commonly used for benchmarking face recognition algorithms.

3. **DukeMTMC-reID Dataset**: This dataset is utilized for the person re-identification (ReID) task. It is a popular dataset in the ReID community.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **CASIA-WebFace Dataset**, the citation is:
  > D. Yi, Z. Lei, S. Liao, and S. Z. Li. *Learning face representation from scratch*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1411.7923, 2014.

- For **LFW Dataset**, the citation is:
  > G. B. Huang, M. Ramesh, T. Berg, and E. Learned-Miller. *Labeled Faces in the Wild: A Database for Studying Face Recognition in Unconstrained Environments*. In Proceedings of the 2007 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 1–6, 2007.

- For **DukeMTMC-reID Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Z. Zheng, L. Zheng, and Y. Yang. *Unlabeled samples generated by GAN improve the person re-identification baseline in vitro*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision, pages 3754–3762, 2017.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
