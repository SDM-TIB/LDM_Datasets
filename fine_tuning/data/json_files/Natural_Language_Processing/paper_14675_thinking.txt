To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MuggleMath: Assessing the Impact of Query and Response Augmentation on Math Reasoning" by Chengpeng Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the datasets introduced in the study. The abstract mentions the creation of two new datasets, **AugGSM8K** and **AugMATH**, which are derived from existing datasets, GSM8K and MATH, respectively. This indicates that these datasets are central to the research.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section**, particularly **section 3.2**, where the authors describe the dataset augmentation methods. Here, they explicitly state that they created **AugGSM8K** by augmenting the GSM8K dataset and **AugMATH** by augmenting the MATH dataset. This section provides details about the augmentation process, confirming the existence and purpose of these datasets.

In **section 3.1**, the authors provide a brief description of the original datasets:
- **GSM8K**: A dataset with elementary school math word problems, consisting of 7,473 training problems and 1,319 testing problems.
- **MATH**: A dataset with challenging high-school math problems, classified into various topics such as Prealgebra, Algebra, and Geometry.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citations for the original datasets:
- For **GSM8K**, the citation is:
  > Karl Cobbe, Vineet Kosaraju, Mohammad Bavarian, Mark Chen, Heewoo Jun, Lukasz Kaiser, Matthias Plappert, Jerry Tworek, Jacob Hilton, Reiichiro Nakano, et al. *Training verifiers to solve math word problems*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2110.14168, 2021.

- For **MATH**, the citation is:
  > Dan Hendrycks, Collin Burns, Saurav Kadavath, Akul Arora, Steven Basart, Eric Tang, Dawn Song, and Jacob Steinhardt. *Measuring mathematical problem solving with the MATH dataset*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2103.03874, 2021.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. The datasets to be documented are:
1. **GSM8K**
2. **MATH**
3. **AugGSM8K** (derived from GSM8K)
4. **AugMATH** (derived from MATH)

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for review or further processing, ensuring that all necessary details are included for each dataset.
