To extract datasets from the research paper titled "WhiteFox: White-Box Compiler Fuzzing Empowered by Large Language Models" by Chenyuan Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract and introduction** sections. These sections often provide a summary of the research and may mention any datasets used for experiments or evaluations. In this case, the abstract discusses the evaluation of WhiteFox on three popular deep learning compilers, which suggests that there may be datasets related to these compilers.

Next, I will look into the **methodology or experiments section** of the paper. This section typically contains detailed information about the datasets used in the experiments. I will specifically look for any mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics. 

In the paper, the authors mention evaluating WhiteFox on three compilers: **PyTorch Inductor, TensorFlow-XLA, and TensorFlow Lite**. However, they do not explicitly mention any datasets in the context of these compilers. Instead, they focus on the optimizations and bugs found during testing.

Since the paper does not provide specific datasets, I will check the **References section** to see if any external datasets are cited that might be relevant to the work. However, the references primarily focus on related works and do not list specific datasets.

Given that no explicit datasets are mentioned in the paper, I will summarize my findings as follows:

1. **Datasets**: The paper does not explicitly mention any datasets used for evaluation or experiments.
2. **Cited Works**: The references do not provide specific datasets but include works related to compiler testing and fuzzing.

Since there are no datasets to cite, I will conclude that the paper does not provide any dataset information. 

In summary, I will document that the research does not include specific datasets, and I will note the focus on compiler optimizations and bug detection instead. This will be my final output regarding dataset extraction from this paper.
