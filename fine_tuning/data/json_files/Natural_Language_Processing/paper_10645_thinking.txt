To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Universal Self-Adaptive Prompting" by Xingchen Wan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to gather initial insights about the datasets used in the study. The abstract mentions evaluating the proposed method on various tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. Here, I will look for specific names of datasets, their purposes, and any relevant details about their structure or content.

In **section B.1 (Datasets)**, the authors provide a detailed list of datasets used in their experiments. I will extract the following datasets:

After identifying these datasets, I will ensure to note their full citations as they are crucial for proper referencing in any subsequent analysis or application of the research findings.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format for easy access and review, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its citation.
