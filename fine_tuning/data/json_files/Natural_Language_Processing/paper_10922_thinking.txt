To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning without Forgetting for Vision-Language Models" by Da-Wei Zhou et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for validation. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets in relation to the research objectives.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, which typically contains detailed information about the datasets used for training and evaluation. In this section, the authors may describe the datasets, including their characteristics, number of instances, and any relevant splits or configurations.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention several datasets used for their experiments:

1. **CIFAR100**: A dataset containing 60,000 images across 100 classes, commonly used for image classification tasks.
2. **CUB200**: A dataset with 11,788 images of birds across 200 species, often used for fine-grained classification.
3. **ImageNet-R**: A variant of the ImageNet dataset, designed to evaluate robustness against various transformations.
4. **ObjectNet**: A dataset that includes images of objects in various contexts, aimed at testing generalization.
5. **Aircraft**: A dataset containing images of different aircraft models, used for classification tasks.
6. **Cars**: A dataset with images of cars across various categories, also used for classification.
7. **UCF101**: A dataset for action recognition in videos, containing 13,320 videos across 101 action categories.
8. **SUN397**: A scene recognition dataset with 397 categories, containing 108,754 images.
9. **Food101**: A dataset containing 101 food categories with 101,000 images.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

Finally, I will compile the dataset information along with their citations into a structured format for easy reference and further use.
