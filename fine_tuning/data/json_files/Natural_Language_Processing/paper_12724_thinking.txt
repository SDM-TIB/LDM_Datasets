To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Causality Guided Disentanglement for Cross-Platform Hate Speech Detection" by Paras Sheth et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets used for hate speech detection.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically looking for a subsection that discusses datasets. In this paper, the authors mention using datasets from four platforms: **Gab, Reddit, Twitter, and YouTube**. I will note the details provided about each dataset, including the number of posts, the number of hateful posts, and the percentage of hate speech.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide a table summarizing the dataset statistics. I will extract the following information for each dataset:

1. **Gab Dataset**: 
   - Number of Posts: 11,093
   - Hateful Posts: 8,379
   - Hate Percentage: 75.5%
   - Citation:

2. **Reddit Dataset**: 
   - Number of Posts: 37,164
   - Hateful Posts: 10,562
   - Hate Percentage: 28.4%
   - Citation: 
     > Kennedy, C. J., Bacon, G., Sahn, A., & von Vacano, C. (2020). Constructing interval variables via faceted Rasch measurement and multitask deep learning: a hate speech application. arXiv preprint arXiv:2009.10277.

3. **Twitter Dataset**: 
   - Number of Posts: 9,055
   - Hateful Posts: 2,406
   - Hate Percentage: 26.5%
   - Citation: 
     > Mathew, B., Saha, P., Yimam, S. M., Biemann, C., Goyal, P., & Mukherjee, A. (2021). Hatexplain: A benchmark dataset for explainable hate speech detection. In Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, 35, 14867–14875.

4. **YouTube Dataset**: 
   - Number of Posts: 1,026
   - Hateful Posts: 642
   - Hate Percentage: 62.5%
   - Citation: 
     > Salminen, J., Almerekhi, H., Milenković, M., Jung, S.-g., An, J., Kwak, H., & Jansen, B. (2018).

In Proceedings of the International AAAI Conference on Web and Social Media, 12.

After gathering this information, I will ensure that I have the full citations for each dataset, as they are crucial for proper attribution and further research.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that can be easily reviewed or processed further.
