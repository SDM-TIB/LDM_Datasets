To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ArzEn-LLM: Code-Switched Egyptian Arabic-English Translation and Speech Recognition Using LLMs" by Ahmed Heakla et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract highlights the development of machine translation (MT) and automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of code-switching and the need for resources to train models on code-switched data. They mention the **ArzEn corpus** as a valuable resource for linguistic research, indicating that this is a dataset of interest.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, where the authors detail their experimental work. They specifically mention using the **ArzEn-ST dataset** for training their models. This dataset is described as a three-way speech translation corpus for code-switched Egyptian Arabic-English, which is crucial for their experiments.

I will also check the **results and discussion sections** to confirm the datasets used and any additional details provided about them. The authors reference the **ArzEn corpus** and **ArzEn-ST dataset** multiple times, reinforcing their significance in the study.

Now, I will consult the **references section** to gather full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. **ArzEn corpus**: The citation is:
   > Hamed, I., Vu, N. T., Abdennadher, S. (2020). *Arzen: A speech corpus for code-switched Egyptian Arabic-English*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation, pages 4237-4246.

2. **ArzEn-ST dataset**: The citation is:
   > Hamed, I., Habash, N., Abdennadher, S., Vu, N. T. (2022). *ArzEn-ST: A Three-way Speech Translation Corpus for Code-Switched Egyptian Arabic-English*. In Bouamor, H., Al-Khalifa, H., Darwish, K., Rambow, O., Bougares, F., Abdelali, A., Tomeh, N., Khalifa, S., Zaghouani, W. (eds) Proceedings of the Seventh Arabic Natural Language Processing Workshop (WANLP), Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates (Hybrid).

With these citations in hand, I can now summarize the datasets:

1. **ArzEn corpus**: A speech corpus designed for code-switched Egyptian Arabic-English, comprising 12 hours of recorded interviews with bilingual speakers.

2. **ArzEn-ST dataset**: A three-way speech translation corpus specifically for code-switched Egyptian Arabic-English, containing 3,344 training sentences and 1,402 test sentences.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
