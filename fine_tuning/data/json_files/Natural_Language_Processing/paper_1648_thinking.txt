To extract datasets from the research paper titled "From Zero to Hero: On the Limitations of Zero-Shot Cross-Lingual Transfer with Multilingual Transformers" by Anne Lauscher et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to gather initial insights about the datasets used in the research. The abstract mentions experiments across various tasks, which suggests that multiple datasets may be involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental setup section** (section 3.1) where the authors detail the tasks and languages involved in their experiments. Here, they explicitly mention the datasets used for different tasks:

1. **Universal Dependency Treebanks (UD)**: This dataset is used for both dependency parsing (DEP) and part-of-speech tagging (POS). The authors specify that they use UD for multiple languages, including Arabic, Chinese, Finnish, and others.

2. **NER WikiANN**: This dataset is referenced for Named Entity Recognition (NER) tasks. The authors indicate that they experiment with the same set of languages as in the DEP and POS tasks.

3. **XNLI Corpus**: This dataset is used for cross-lingual natural language inference (XNLI). The authors describe it as being created by crowd-translating the English Multi-NLI dataset into 14 languages.

4. **XQuAD Dataset**: This dataset is utilized for cross-lingual question answering (XQuAD). The authors explain that it was created by translating the SQuAD v1.1 dataset into multiple languages.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **Universal Dependency Treebanks**, the citation is:
  > Nivre, J., et al. (2017). Universal Dependencies 2.1. In Proceedings of the 15th Conference of the European Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Volume 2, Short Papers, pages 8–14.

- For **NER WikiANN**, the citation is:
  > Rahimi, A., Li, Y., & Cohn, T. (2019). Massively multilingual transfer for NER. In Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, pages 151–164.

- For **XNLI Corpus**, the citation is:
  > Conneau, A., et al. (2018). XNLI: Evaluating cross-lingual sentence representations. In Proceedings of the 2018 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 1112–1122.

- For **XQuAD Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Artetxe, M., et al. (2019). Cross-lingual Question Answering. In Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, pages 240–250.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or analysis. This process ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their respective citations as required.
