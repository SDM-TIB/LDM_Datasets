To extract datasets from the research paper titled "BigFUSE: Global Context-Aware Image Fusion in Dual-View Light-Sheet Fluorescence Microscopy with Image Formation Prior" by Yu Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, results, and conclusion sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the challenges of light-sheet fluorescence microscopy and the proposed solution, BigFUSE, but does not explicitly mention datasets. 

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to see if any datasets are referenced in the context of previous work or experiments. The introduction discusses dual-view LSFM and the need for image fusion but does not specify any datasets.

In the **methods section**, I will look for any mention of datasets used for evaluation or training. The authors describe the BigFUSE method and its components but do not provide specific dataset names.

Moving on to the **results section**, I will check if the authors present any experimental results based on specific datasets. They mention evaluations on LSFM images with synthetic blur and real blur, but again, no specific datasets are cited.

Finally, I will examine the **references section** to see if any datasets are cited in the context of previous studies or methodologies. The references include various papers related to image fusion and microscopy techniques, but they do not provide specific datasets used in this study.

After thoroughly reviewing the paper, it appears that the authors did not explicitly mention any datasets by name. However, they refer to a mouse brain sample collected in a previous study (Dean et al., 2022) for their synthetic blur evaluation. This could be considered a dataset, but it is not a standalone dataset like those typically referenced in other studies.

For the citation of the relevant study, I will note:
- For the mouse brain sample, the citation is:
  > Dean, K.M., Chakraborty, T., Daetwyler, S., Lin, J., Garrelts, G., M’Saad, O., Mekbib, H.T., Voigt, F.F., Schaettin, M., Stoeckli, E.T., et al. *Isotropic imaging across spatial scales with axially swept light-sheet microscopy*. Nature protocols 17(9), 2025–2053, 2022. https://doi.org/10.1038/s41596-022-00706-6

Since no other datasets were explicitly mentioned, I will compile this information into a structured output for review or further processing.
