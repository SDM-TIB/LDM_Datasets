To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On Computationally Efficient Learning of Exponential Family Distributions" by Abhin Shah et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract typically provides a concise overview, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or data sources.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any statements regarding the datasets used for experiments or evaluations. This section often outlines the context and significance of the research, which may include references to specific datasets.

I will then focus on the **methodology and experiments sections**. These sections usually contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used, including their characteristics, sizes, and any relevant preprocessing steps. I will look for specific names of datasets and any associated metrics or benchmarks that the authors may have used.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, if the authors mention using the **Penn Action Dataset** and the **sub-JHMDB Dataset**, I will look for their full citations in the references. The citations might look like this:

- **Penn Action Dataset**:
  > Wenzheng Zhang, Menglong Zhu, and Konstantinos G. Derpanis. *From Actemes to Action: A Strongly-Supervised Representation for Detailed Action Understanding*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 2248–2255, 2013.

- **sub-JHMDB Dataset**:
  > Haoqi Fan Jhuang, Juergen Gall, Silvia Zuffi, Cordelia Schmid, and Michael J. Black. *Towards Understanding Action Recognition*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 3192–3199, 2013.

Finally, I will compile the information about each dataset, including its name, description, and full citation, ensuring that I maintain clarity and accuracy in the documentation. This structured approach will help ensure that I capture all relevant datasets mentioned in the paper.
