To extract datasets from the research paper titled "WEARS: Wearable Emotion AI with Real-time Sensor data" by Dhruv Limbani et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and data collection sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors collected data from volunteers using a smartwatch to predict emotions, which suggests that there is a dataset involved.

Next, I will focus on **section III (Data Collection)**, where the authors describe the process of gathering data from volunteers. They mention using a Samsung Galaxy Watch to collect heart rate, accelerometer, and gyroscope data while participants watched videos designed to evoke emotions. This section implies that the data collected forms a dataset, but I need to clarify its structure and content.

In **section IV (Data Processing)**, the authors detail the formation of two types of datasets: a non-statistical dataset containing raw sensor readings and a statistical dataset that includes processed features such as mean, mode, and other heart rate metrics. This distinction is crucial for understanding the datasets used in their experiments.

The authors also mention that they collected data from 78 volunteers, which is important for describing the dataset's size and scope. They refer to the videos used for emotion elicitation as coming from the **FilmStim dataset**, which is another dataset that needs to be cited.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. For the **FilmStim dataset**, the citation is:
   > Schaefer, Alexandre, and Dexter Rong. "English versions of the emotional stimuli tested by Schaefer et al. (2010)." *Cognition & Emotion*, 24(7), 1153-1172, 2010. doi:10.1080/02699930903205682.

2. For the **Samsung Galaxy Watch data**, since it is original data collected by the authors, I will note that it is a proprietary dataset created for this study, and I will describe it accordingly.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited. This will include details about the types of data collected, the number of participants, and the purpose of the dataset in the context of the research.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring that all necessary information is included for review or further processing.
