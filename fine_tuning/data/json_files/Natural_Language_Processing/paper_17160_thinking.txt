To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Style Generation in Robot Calligraphy with Deep Generative Adversarial Networks" by Xiaoming Wang and Zhiguo Gong, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract highlights the challenges in generating high-quality calligraphy due to the lack of datasets, which suggests that datasets are a critical component of the research.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Fonts Dataset and Network Configuration)**, as it is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets used. In this section, the authors mention that they proposed a new dataset for generating traditional calligraphy images, specifically containing the **Kai font** and the **QiGong font**. Each font has at least 3500 images of frequently used characters, which are preprocessed to 256 × 256 binary images. This indicates that the dataset is specifically designed for their experiments.

I will also note that the authors mention the creation of training and testing sets, with at least 500 calligraphy images in the testing set. This information is crucial for understanding the dataset's structure and purpose.

To ensure I have the correct citations, I will check the **References section** for any papers that describe the dataset creation methods or the specific fonts used. The authors reference a previous work that discusses the calligraphy synthesis method, which is essential for understanding the dataset's origins. The citation for this work is:

- Wang, X., Yang, Y., Wang, W., Zhou, Y., Yin, Y., Gong, Z. *Generative adversarial networks based motion learning towards robotic calligraphy synthesis*. CAAI Transactions on Intelligence Technology (2023).

Now, I will compile the dataset information:

1. **Dataset Name**: Kai Font Dataset
   - **Description**: Contains at least 3500 images of frequently used characters in the Kai font, preprocessed to 256 × 256 binary images.
   - **Citation**: Wang, X., Yang, Y., Wang, W., Zhou, Y., Yin, Y., Gong, Z. *Generative adversarial networks based motion learning towards robotic calligraphy synthesis*. CAAI Transactions on Intelligence Technology (2023).

2. **Dataset Name**: QiGong Font Dataset
   - **Description**: Contains at least 3500 images of frequently used characters in the QiGong font, preprocessed to 256 × 256 binary images.
   - **Citation**: Wang, X., Yang, Y., Wang, W., Zhou, Y., Yin, Y., Gong, Z. *Generative adversarial networks based motion learning towards robotic calligraphy synthesis*. CAAI Transactions on Intelligence Technology (2023).

After gathering all this information, I will prepare to format it according to the required structure for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the research paper.
