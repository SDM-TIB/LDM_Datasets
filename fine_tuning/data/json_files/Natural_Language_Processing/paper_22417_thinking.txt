To extract datasets from the research paper titled “We are at the mercy of others’ opinion”: Supporting Blind People in Recreational Window Shopping with AI-infused Technology by Rie Kamikubo et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on the challenges faced by blind individuals in recreational shopping, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets.

Next, I will examine the **methods section**, particularly the part detailing the formative study with blind participants. Here, the authors describe conducting focus groups and interviews, but they do not specify any datasets in the traditional sense (like publicly available datasets). Instead, they mention the number of participants and the qualitative data collected.

I will also look for any **tables or figures** that might summarize participant demographics or findings, as these often contain valuable information about the data collected. In this paper, there is a table (Table 1) that provides demographic information about the participants, which is crucial for understanding the context of the study.

Since the paper does not reference any external datasets but rather presents original qualitative data collected from participants, I will note that the data is derived from the authors' own research rather than from established datasets.

Now, I will compile the relevant information regarding the participant demographics and the qualitative data collection process into a structured format. However, since there are no external datasets to cite, I will focus on the original contributions of the authors.

Finally, I will ensure to include the full citation for the paper itself, as it serves as the source of the data collected:

- Kamikubo, R., Kacorri, H., & Asakawa, C. (2024). “We are at the mercy of others’ opinion”: Supporting Blind People in Recreational Window Shopping with AI-infused Technology. In Proceedings of the 21st International Web for All Conference, May 13–14, 2024, Singapore. ACM, New York, NY, USA, 14 pages.

In summary, while there are no traditional datasets to extract, I will document the participant demographics and the qualitative nature of the data collected, along with the citation for the paper itself.
