To extract datasets from the research paper titled "In the Line of Fire: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Job Burnout Among Nurses" by Zahra Ghasemi Kooktapeh et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mention of datasets or data sources. The abstract indicates that the study uses a systematic review and meta-analysis approach, which suggests that it likely references multiple studies and their associated datasets.

Next, I will examine the **methodology section**, particularly the part where the authors describe their search strategy and inclusion criteria. This section often provides insights into the specific datasets or studies that were included in the meta-analysis. The authors mention searching three databases: **PubMed, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar**, and using the **Maslach Burnout Questionnaire** as a key tool for measuring burnout. 

I will also look for any **tables or figures** that summarize the studies included in the analysis, as these often list the datasets used. In this case, the findings section refers to **Table 1**, which presents the prevalence of burnout among nurses across nine studies. I will need to identify these studies to extract the datasets.

After identifying the studies, I will check the **References section** for full citations of each dataset. The authors may have cited the original studies that provided the data on nurse burnout, which is crucial for proper attribution.

For example, one of the studies mentioned is by Khammar et al. (2018), which provides a dataset on the prevalence of nurse burnout in Iran. The citation for this dataset is:
> Khammar, A., Dalvand, S., Hashemian, A. H., Poursadeghiyan, M., Yarmohammadi, S., Babakhani, J., & Yarmohammadi, H. (2018). Data for the prevalence of nurse burnout in Iran (a meta-analysis dataset). Data in Brief, 20, 1779â€“1786. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dib.2018.09.022

I will repeat this process for each study referenced in the findings, ensuring that I capture the full citation for each dataset used in the meta-analysis.

Finally, I will compile all the extracted datasets along with their citations into a structured format for easy reference and further analysis. This systematic approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant datasets and their citations from the paper.
