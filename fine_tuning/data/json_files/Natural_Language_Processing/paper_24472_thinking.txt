To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Paraphrase and Aggregate with Large Language Models for Minimizing Intent Classification Errors" by Vikas Yadav et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their method on two large multi-class classification datasets: **CLINC** and **Banking**. This is a strong indication that I need to gather more details about these datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors explicitly mention the two datasets: **CLINC** (with 150 intent classes) and **Banking-50** (with 77 intent classes). They provide context about the datasets, including their significance in intent classification tasks. This section confirms the datasets' names and their relevance to the study.

I will then look into the **datasets section** (section 3.2) for detailed descriptions. Here, the authors provide specific information about both datasets:

1. **CLINC Dataset**: This dataset contains 150 intent classes and is used for evaluating intent classification performance. The authors mention that it includes 4.5K test inputs.

2. **Banking-50 Dataset**: This dataset consists of 77 intent classes, with 50% of the intent labels masked and labeled as out-of-domain (OOD). The authors note that it has 1.5K test inputs.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution:

- For the **CLINC Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Larson, S., Mahendran, A., Peper, J. J., Clarke, C., Lee, A., Hill, P., Kummerfeld, J. K., Leach, K., Laurenzano, M. A., Tang, L., et al. (2019). An evaluation dataset for intent classification and out-of-scope prediction. In Proceedings of the 2019 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing and the 9th International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing (EMNLP-IJCNLP), pages 1311–1316.

- For the **Banking-50 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Casanueva, I., Temˇcinas, T., Gerz, D., Henderson, M., & Vuli´c, I. (2020). Efficient intent detection with dual sentence encoders. In Proceedings of the 2nd Workshop on Natural Language Processing for Conversational AI, pages 38–45.

With this information gathered, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will allow for a structured output that can be used for further analysis or processing.
