To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Geometric Invariant Features for Classification of Vector Polygons with Graph Message-passing Neural Network" by Zexian Huang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the datasets used in the study. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on benchmark datasets, specifically referring to a **synthetic glyph dataset** and a **real-world building footprint dataset**. This indicates that there are at least two datasets to look for.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 3), where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets. In **subsection 3.1 (Datasets)**, they introduce the two datasets:

1. **Glyph Dataset**: This is a synthetic dataset consisting of 26 Latin alphabet character glyph geometries, with a total of 1,413 sans serif and 1,002 serif fonts. The dataset is designed for benchmarking the classification performance of learning models on vector polygons.

2. **OSM Dataset**: This dataset contains 10,000 real-world building footprints extracted from OpenStreetMap (OSM), labeled by 10 categories based on a template matching to letters. It is used to test the generalizability of learning models on spatial objects.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The paper cites the following sources:

- For the **Glyph Dataset**, the authors refer to a source from Google Fonts:
  > Google. *Google Fonts*. Available at: https://fonts.google.com/ (2010).

- For the **OSM Dataset**, the citation is:
  > OpenStreetMap contributors. *Planet dump retrieved from* https://planet.osm.org. Available at: https://www.openstreetmap.org (2017).

Now that I have the names and citations for both datasets, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly presents each dataset along with its full citation.

Finally, I will ensure that the dataset entries are ready for review or further processing, maintaining clarity and accuracy in the documentation of the datasets used in the research.
