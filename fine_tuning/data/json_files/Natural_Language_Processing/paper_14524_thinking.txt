To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Controlling Topic-Focus Articulation in Meaning-to-Text Generation using Graph Neural Networks" by Chunliu Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, but I need to look for specific dataset names or descriptions.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of Topic-Focus Articulation (TFA) and mention using data from the **Parallel Meaning Bank (PMB)**. This indicates that there is a dataset involved, but I need to confirm its details.

Next, I will check **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe their implementation details. Here, they mention using data from **release 4.0.0 of the Parallel Meaning Bank**, which contains 10,711 gold instances and 127,302 silver instances. This section provides specific information about the dataset, including the number of instances and their types.

I will also look for any additional datasets mentioned in the **experiments or results sections**. However, it appears that the PMB is the primary dataset used for their experiments.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citation for the Parallel Meaning Bank dataset. The relevant citation is:

- For the **Parallel Meaning Bank**:
  > Lasha Abzianidze, Johannes Bjerva, Kilian Evang, Hessel Haagsma, Rik van Noord, Pierre Ludmann, Duc-Duy Nguyen, and Johan Bos. *The Parallel Meaning Bank: Towards a multilingual corpus of translations annotated with compositional meaning representations*. In Proceedings of the 15th Conference of the European Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Volume 2, Short Papers, pages 242â€“247, Valencia, Spain, 2017.

With this information, I will summarize the dataset details and prepare to format them according to the required structure.

In conclusion, I have identified the **Parallel Meaning Bank** as the dataset used in the research, and I have retrieved its full citation for documentation purposes. I will now compile this information into the specified format for further processing.
