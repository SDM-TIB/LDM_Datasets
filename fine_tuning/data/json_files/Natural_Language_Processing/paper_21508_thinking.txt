To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fusion-Mamba for Cross-modality Object Detection" by Wenhao Dong et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the proposed method is evaluated on "public datasets," which indicates that specific datasets will be discussed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, the authors explicitly mention three datasets:

1. **LLVIP**: This dataset is described as containing 15,488 RGB-IR image pairs collected in low-light environments, with 12,025 pairs used for training and 3,463 pairs for testing.

2. **M 3F D**: This dataset consists of 4,200 RGB and IR-aligned image pairs collected in various environments, including different lighting, seasons, and weather scenarios. The authors mention that they used train/test splits provided by a referenced source.

3. **FLIR**: This dataset includes images collected in day and night scenes with five categories: people, car, bike, dog, and other cars. The authors specify that they used 4,129 pairs for training and 1,013 for testing.

To ensure accuracy, I will check the **References section** for the full citations of these datasets:

- For **LLVIP**, the citation is:
  > Xinyu Jia, Chuang Zhu, Minzhen Li, Wenqi Tang, and Wenli Zhou. *LLVIP: A visible-infrared paired dataset for low-light vision*. In IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision Workshops, ICCVW 2021, Montreal, BC, Canada, October 11-17, 2021, pages 3489–3497. IEEE, 2021.

- For **M 3F D**, the citation is:
  > Jinyuan Liu, Xin Fan, Zhanbo Huang, Guanyao Wu, Risheng Liu, Wei Zhong, and Zhongxuan Luo. *Target-aware dual adversarial learning and a multi-scenario multi-modality benchmark to fuse infrared and visible for object detection*.

- For **FLIR**, the citation is:
  > TELEDYNE FLIR. *Free teledyne flir thermal dataset for algorithm training*. Online, 2024.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
