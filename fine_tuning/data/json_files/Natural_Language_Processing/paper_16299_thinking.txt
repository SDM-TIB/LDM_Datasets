To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Potential Societal Biases of ChatGPT in Higher Education: A Scoping Review" by Ming Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and findings sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's purpose and findings, which may hint at the datasets used or referenced. The introduction will help me understand the context and the specific biases being discussed, which might lead to identifying relevant datasets.

Next, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets in the **methodology section**. This section often details the data sources used for the scoping review, including databases searched and any specific datasets referenced. In this case, the authors mention that they categorized potential societal biases and reviewed articles from various databases, which might include datasets relevant to their analysis.

I will also check the **findings section** for any specific datasets that were analyzed or referenced in the context of societal biases related to ChatGPT in higher education. If the authors discuss empirical studies or data analyses, they may mention specific datasets used in those studies.

After identifying any datasets mentioned in the text, I will then consult the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial as it provides the necessary details for proper attribution and allows others to locate the datasets used in the research.

For example, if the paper references a dataset like the "Law School Admission Council (LSAC) dataset," I would look for the full citation in the references section, which might include details such as the authors, title, publication year, and where it can be accessed.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and ease of use.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and cite all relevant datasets from the paper, contributing to a comprehensive understanding of the research conducted by Ming Li et al.
