To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MasonTigers at SemEval-2024 Task 8: Performance Analysis of Transformer-based Models on Machine-Generated Text Detection" by Sadiya Sayara Chowdhury Puspo et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and datasets sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the tasks involved, but I need to look for specific dataset names and details in the main body of the paper.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of detecting machine-generated text and mention that the SemEval-2024 Task 8 involves various subtasks. However, they do not specify datasets here, so I will move on to the **datasets section**.

In **section 3 (Datasets)**, the authors describe the datasets used for the tasks. They mention that the data for Subtask A (Binary Human-Written vs. Machine-Generated Text Classification) is sourced from five distinct platforms: **Wikipedia, WikiHow, Reddit, arXiv, and PeerRead**. They also mention that the multilingual track includes data from various languages, but the specific datasets are not named here.

Next, I will look for any tables or figures that provide more detailed information about the datasets. In **Table 1**, the authors provide a label distribution for the training and validation data for Subtask A, which includes the number of instances from each source. This confirms the datasets used but does not provide full citations.

To find the full citations for the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper. Here, I can find citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. **Wikipedia**: The authors do not provide a specific citation for the Wikipedia dataset, but it is commonly referenced as:
   > Wikipedia contributors. *Wikipedia, The Free Encyclopedia*. [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/).

2. **WikiHow**: The citation for the WikiHow dataset is:
   > Mahnaz Koupaee and William Yang Wang. *WikiHow: A Large Scale Text Summarization Dataset*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1810.09305, 2018.

3. **Reddit**: The authors refer to the ELI5 dataset from Reddit, which can be cited as:
   > Reddit. *ELI5: Explain Like I'm Five*. [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/eli5/).

4. **arXiv**: The citation for the arXiv dataset is:
   > arXiv. *arXiv: A Repository of Electronic Preprints*. [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/).

5. **PeerRead**: The citation for the PeerRead dataset is:
   > Dongyeop Kang et al. *A Dataset of Peer Reviews (PeerRead): Collection, Insights and NLP Applications*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1804.09635, 2018.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. Each dataset will be described with its name, a brief description, and the full citation.
