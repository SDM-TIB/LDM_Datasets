To extract datasets from the research paper titled "VideoMamba: Spatio-Temporal Selective State Space Model" by Jinyoung Park et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that VideoMamba demonstrates competitive performance on various video understanding benchmarks, which suggests that specific datasets are used for evaluation. I will look for any dataset names or references in these sections.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 5), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, the authors explicitly mention three datasets for action recognition tasks:

1. **Kinetics-400 (K400)**: The paper states that this dataset contains approximately 240,000 training videos and 20,000 validation videos across 400 human action classes.

2. **Something-Something V2 (SSV2)**: This dataset consists of 168,900 training videos and 24,700 validation videos over 174 classes.

3. **HMDB51**: This dataset is smaller, containing around 9,500 training videos and 3,500 validation videos from 51 classes.

I will confirm the details of these datasets by checking any additional sections that may provide more context, such as the **related work** or **implementation details** sections, but the experiments section is usually sufficient for dataset identification.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. 

The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **Kinetics-400**, the citation is:
  > Carreira, J., & Zisserman, A. (2017). *Quo vadis, action recognition? A new model and the kinetics dataset*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pp. 6299–6308.

- For **Something-Something V2**, the citation is:
  > Goyal, R., Ebrahimi Kahou, S., Michalski, V., Materzynska, J., Westphal, S., Kim, H., Haenel, V., Fruend, I., Yianilos, P., Mueller-Freitag, M., et al. (2017). *The "Something-Something" video database for learning and evaluating visual common sense*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pp. 5842–5850.

- For **HMDB51**, the citation is:
  > Kuehne, H., Jhuang, H., Garrote, E., Poggio, T., & Serre, T. (2011). *HMDB: A large video database for human motion recognition*. In 2011 International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pp. 2556–2563.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this into a structured format for further processing or review.
