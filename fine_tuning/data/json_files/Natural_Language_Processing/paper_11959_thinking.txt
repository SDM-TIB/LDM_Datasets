To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Large Language and Text-to-3D Models for Engineering Design Optimization" by Thiago Rios et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the use of a text-to-3D generative model called Shap-E, which suggests that there may be datasets associated with this model.

Next, I will focus on the **literature review and methods sections**. In the literature review, the authors discuss generative models like Shap-E and Point-E, indicating that these models are trained on specific datasets. I will look for any explicit mentions of these datasets.

In the **methods section**, the authors describe the use of Shap-E and mention that it was trained on an extended version of the dataset used in a previous work (Point-E). This indicates that there is a dataset associated with Shap-E, but I need to find the exact reference.

I will also check the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The authors reference the Shap-E model and its training data, which is crucial for documenting the datasets accurately.

From the text, I identify the following datasets:

1. **Shap-E Dataset**: The paper states that Shap-E was trained on a dataset comprising millions of 3D objects represented as point clouds and renderings. However, the specific citation for this dataset is not provided in the text. I will need to refer to the original Shap-E paper for the complete citation.

2. **Point-E Dataset**: The authors mention that Shap-E builds upon the Point-E model, which also relies on a dataset of 3D objects. The citation for the Point-E dataset is:
   > Nichol, A., Jun, H., Dhariwal, P., Mishkin, P., & Chen, M. (2022). *Point-E: A system for generating 3D point clouds from complex prompts*. arXiv. Available: https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.11163

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
