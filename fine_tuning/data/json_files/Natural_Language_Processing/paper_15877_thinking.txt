To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Attributes Grouping and Mining Hashing for Fine-Grained Image Retrieval" by Xin Lu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on "five fine-grained datasets." This indicates that there are specific datasets used in the experiments, which I need to identify.

Next, I will look closely at **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors typically provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used in their experiments. In this section, the authors list the following datasets:

1. **CUB200-2011**: This dataset contains 11,788 images of 200 bird categories, split into 5,994 training images and 5,794 test images.
2. **Aircraft**: A dataset consisting of 6,667 training images and 3,333 test images of 100 aircraft variants.
3. **Food101**: This dataset includes 101,000 images across 101 food categories, with specific training and testing splits.
4. **VegFru**: A dataset comprising 29,200 training samples, 14,600 validation samples, and 116,931 test samples, covering 200 types of vegetables and 92 types of fruits.
5. **Stanford Dogs**: This dataset contains 20,580 images of 120 dog breeds, with 100 images per class for training.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

Now that I have gathered the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
