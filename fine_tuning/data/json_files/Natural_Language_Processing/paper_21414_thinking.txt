To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On Unified Prompt Tuning for Request Quality Assurance in Public Code Review" by Xinyu Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on the **Public Code Review dataset for the time span 2011-2023**. This indicates that there is a specific dataset being utilized, which I need to explore further.

Next, I will look into **section 4.1 (Dataset and Metrics)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset used for their experiments. Here, they describe the dataset as being sourced from **StackExchange**, specifically the public code review website, and mention that it covers raw data from 2011 to 2023. They also discuss the cleaning process and the final dataset size, which consists of **76,161 requests**.

In this section, the authors also mention that they set a threshold for rare tags and provide statistics about the dataset, including the number of necessary and unnecessary requests. This information is crucial for understanding the dataset's context and its application in their research.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The authors reference the dataset as follows:

- For the **Public Code Review dataset**, the citation is:
  > Chen, X., Li, L., Zhang, R., & Liang, P. (2024). Dataset of the paper: On unified prompt tuning for request quality assurance in public code review. Retrieved from https://archive.org/download/stackexchange/codereview.stackexchange.com.7z

With this information, I can summarize the dataset extraction as follows:

1. **Public Code Review Dataset**: This dataset is sourced from StackExchange and spans the years 2011 to 2023. It contains a total of **76,161 requests** after cleaning, with a focus on request necessity prediction and tag recommendation tasks.

Now, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing, ensuring that I include the full citation for the dataset as required.
