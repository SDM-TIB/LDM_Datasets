To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Efficient Multi-scale Network with Learnable Discrete Wavelet Transform for Blind Motion Deblurring" by Xin Gao et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that the proposed method exhibits state-of-the-art performance on multiple real-world deblurred datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets and Implementation Details)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they mention three datasets:

1. **RealBlur Dataset**: This dataset is referenced as a benchmark for learning and evaluating deblurring algorithms. It consists of blurry-sharp image pairs and is crucial for assessing the performance of the proposed method.

2. **RSBlur Dataset**: This dataset is described as a realistic blur synthesis dataset, also composed of blurry-sharp image pairs. It is used to ensure fair comparisons with other advanced algorithms.

3. **GoPro Dataset**: This is another well-known dataset in the deblurring community, consisting of blurry-sharp image pairs, and is used for extensive comparisons with state-of-the-art methods.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **RealBlur Dataset**, the citation is:

- For the **RSBlur Dataset**, the citation is:

- For the **GoPro Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Seungjun Nah, Tae Hyun Kim, and Kyoung Mu Lee. *Deep multi-scale convolutional neural network for dynamic scene deblurring*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 3883–3891, 2017.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
