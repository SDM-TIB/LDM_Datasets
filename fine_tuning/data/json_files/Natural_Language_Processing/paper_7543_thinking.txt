To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Spatial-Temporal Identity: A Simple yet Effective Baseline for Multivariate Time Series Forecasting" by Zezhi Shao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a general overview, but the experiments section is likely to contain specific details about the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of multivariate time series forecasting and mention that they will evaluate their proposed model on several datasets. However, they do not specify the datasets here.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, particularly **subsection 4.1 (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors list the datasets used for their experiments. They mention five datasets: **PEMS04, PEMS07, PEMS08, PEMS-BAY, and Electricity**. The statistical information about these datasets is summarized in Table 1, which includes details such as the length, number of variants, sample rate, and time span.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper. The authors do not provide specific citations for the datasets themselves, but they reference previous works that likely introduced these datasets. I will look for the original papers or sources for each dataset:

1. **PEMS04 Dataset**: The original source is likely to be found in traffic forecasting literature. I will search for the foundational paper that introduced this dataset.
   
2. **PEMS07 Dataset**: Similar to PEMS04, I will look for the original paper that introduced this dataset.

3. **PEMS08 Dataset**: Again, I will identify the original source for this dataset.

4. **PEMS-BAY Dataset**: I will find the foundational paper that introduced this dataset.

5. **Electricity Dataset**: I will search for the original paper that introduced this dataset.

After gathering the citations, I will compile them as follows:

- For **PEMS04**, I will cite the original paper that introduced it.
- For **PEMS07**, I will do the same.
- For **PEMS08**, I will find and cite the original source.
- For **PEMS-BAY**, I will locate the original paper and cite it.
- For **Electricity**, I will find the original source and provide the citation.

Once I have all the necessary citations, I will ensure that they are formatted correctly and provide a brief description of each dataset, including its purpose and any relevant characteristics.

Finally, I will compile all this information into a structured format that clearly presents each dataset along with its citation, ready for further processing or review.
