To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Does nematic order allow groups of elongated cells to sense electric fields better?" by Kurmanbek Kaiyrbekov and Brian A. Camley, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, results, and discussion sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or experimental data.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to see if the authors reference any specific datasets or prior studies that utilized datasets relevant to their research. This section often contains background information that can lead to identifying datasets.

In the **methods section**, I will look for detailed descriptions of the experiments conducted, including any datasets used for simulations or analyses. The authors may describe the parameters of their simulations or any real-world data they used, which could indicate the datasets involved.

The **results section** is crucial as it often contains figures, tables, or descriptions of the data collected during the experiments. I will carefully examine any figures or tables that present data, as they may reference specific datasets or provide insights into the data used.

Finally, I will check the **discussion section** for any mentions of datasets that were analyzed or compared against other datasets. The authors may discuss the implications of their findings in relation to existing datasets.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is important for proper attribution and to provide context for the datasets used in the research.

For example, if the authors mention using a dataset from a previous study, I will locate that study in the references and extract the full citation.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets used in the research paper, providing full citations for each to maintain academic integrity.
