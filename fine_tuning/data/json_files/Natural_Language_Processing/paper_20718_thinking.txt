To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Knowledge-Enhanced Dual-stream Zero-shot Composed Image Retrieval" by Yucheng Suo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. In the abstract, the authors mention conducting extensive experiments on widely used benchmarks, specifically naming **ImageNet-R**, **COCO**, **Fashion-IQ**, and **CIRR**. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for the evaluation of their proposed method.

Next, I will look into **section 4.1 (Datasets and Setup)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the datasets used for training and evaluation. Here, they mention:

1. **Conceptual Caption Three Million (CC3M)**: This dataset is used for training and consists of a wide variety of image-caption pairs. The authors note that it has no overlap with the evaluation datasets.

2. **ImageNet-R**: This dataset is used for domain conversion tasks and contains 16,983 real images across 200 classes.

3. **COCO**: Specifically, the validation set of COCO is used for evaluating object composition, consisting of 5,000 images.

4. **Fashion-IQ**: This dataset is utilized for fashion attribute manipulation, designed for retrieving images based on natural language feedback.

5. **CIRR**: This dataset consists of crowd-sourced, open-domain images with hand-written descriptions, used for scene manipulation tasks.

After identifying these datasets, I will proceed to the **References section** to gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

- For **Conceptual Caption Three Million (CC3M)**, the citation is:

- For **Fashion-IQ**, the citation is:
  > Hui Wu, Yupeng Gao, Xiaoxiao Guo, Ziad Al-Halah, Steven Rennie, Kristen Grauman, and Rogerio Feris. *Fashion IQ: A new dataset towards retrieving images by natural language feedback*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 11307–11317, 2021.

- For **CIRR**, the citation is:

Now that I have gathered the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
