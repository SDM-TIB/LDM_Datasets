To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Making Substitute Models More Bayesian Can Enhance Transferability of Adversarial Examples" by Qizhang Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that extensive experiments were conducted on common benchmark datasets, which indicates that specific datasets will be discussed later in the paper. I will look for explicit mentions of dataset names or descriptions in these sections.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section 4) in detail, as this is where datasets are typically described. In this section, the authors mention conducting experiments on **CIFAR-10** and **ImageNet**. I will note these datasets as they are widely recognized benchmarks in the field of machine learning.

I will also check the **references section** to find full citations for these datasets. The references will provide the necessary details for proper citation.

For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
> Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical report, Citeseer, 2009.

For **ImageNet**, the citation is:
> Olga Russakovsky, Jia Deng, Hao Su, Jonathan Krause, Sanjeev Satheesh, Sean Ma, Zhiheng Huang, Andrej Karpathy, Aditya Khosla, Michael Bernstein, Alexander C. Berg, and Li Fei-Fei. *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. IJCV, 2015.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly presents each dataset along with its full citation. This will ensure that the datasets are accurately documented for future reference or analysis.
