To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Scalarisation-based risk concepts for robust multi-objective optimisation" by Ben Tu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract often summarizes the key contributions and may mention datasets used for experiments or case studies.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (likely section 6 in this paper) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. This section is crucial as it usually contains detailed information about the datasets, including their names, sizes, and any relevant characteristics.

In this paper, the authors mention two case studies: the **cake baking dataset** and the **rocket injector dataset**. I will extract the relevant details for each:

1. **Cake Baking Dataset**: This dataset consists of results from 50 cake baking experiments, focusing on the relationship between the properties of cakes (calories, taste, browning) and the composition of ingredients. The dataset is publicly available on GitHub.

2. **Rocket Injector Dataset**: This dataset relates to the optimization of a rocket injector design, considering various geometric features and their effects on performance metrics. The authors describe the objectives and the uncertain parameters involved.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. This is important for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For the **cake baking dataset**, the citation is:
> The cake dataset is available in the following GitHub repository: https://github.com/basf/mopti.

For the **rocket injector dataset**, the citation is:
> Vaidyanathan, R., Tucker, K., Papila, N., & Shyy, W. (2003). CFD-based design optimization for single element rocket injector. In 41st Aerospace Sciences Meeting and Exhibit, Aerospace Sciences Meetings, pages 1â€“21. American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations into a structured format for further processing or review.
