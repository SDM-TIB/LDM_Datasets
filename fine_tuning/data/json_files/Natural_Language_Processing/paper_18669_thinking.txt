To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Event-based Product Carousel Recommendation with Query-Click Graph" by Luyi Ma et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract discusses the challenges of building a recommender system due to the lack of ground truth for event-related aspects and products, which suggests that there may be datasets involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors describe their dataset. In this section, they mention that they collected search query and impression/click data from Walmart.com for two specific events: **Valentine’s Day** and **Summer Water Activity**. This indicates that these two events are associated with datasets that will be relevant for my extraction.

I will then look for specific details about these datasets. The authors provide statistics in **Table I**, which summarizes the number of queries and unique clicked product-types for both events:

1. **Valentine’s Day Dataset**: 
   - Number of Queries: 693,556
   - Unique Clicked Product-types: 999
   - Unique Impression Product-types: 2,528

2. **Summer Water Activity Dataset**: 
   - Number of Queries: 34,023
   - Unique Clicked Product-types: 202
   - Unique Impression Product-types: 821

Next, I will check the **References section** to find any citations related to these datasets. However, since the datasets are derived from the authors' own data collection efforts on Walmart.com, they may not have formal citations like publicly available datasets. Instead, I will note that the datasets are based on proprietary data from Walmart.com.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring to include the dataset names, descriptions, and any relevant statistics. The full citations for the datasets will be noted as follows:

- For **Valentine’s Day Dataset**:
  > Luyi Ma, Nimesh Sinha, Parth Vajge, Jason H.D. Cho, Sushant Kumar, Kannan Achan. *Event-based Product Carousel Recommendation with Query-Click Graph*. Walmart Global Tech, Sunnyvale, CA. 

- For **Summer Water Activity Dataset**:
  > Luyi Ma, Nimesh Sinha, Parth Vajge, Jason H.D. Cho, Sushant Kumar, Kannan Achan. *Event-based Product Carousel Recommendation with Query-Click Graph*. Walmart Global Tech, Sunnyvale, CA.

Finally, I will ensure that I have accurately captured the essence of each dataset and its relevance to the research presented in the paper. This will prepare me for creating the final structured output for the datasets.
