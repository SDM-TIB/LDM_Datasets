To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Pearl: A Production-Ready Reinforcement Learning Agent" by Zheqing Zhu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. The introduction discusses various applications of reinforcement learning but does not specify datasets either. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4), as this is where datasets are typically discussed in detail. In this section, the authors mention benchmarking their Pearl agent on various tasks, including classic reinforcement learning tasks like CartPole and Mujoco environments. However, they also mention creating their own offline datasets based on the D4RL paper.

In **subsection 4.1 (Reinforcement Learning Benchmarks)**, the authors state that they created a small dataset of 100k transitions by training a soft-actor critic (SAC) based agent. This dataset is crucial for their experiments, and I will need to document it.

In **subsection 4.2 (Neural Contextual Bandits Benchmarks)**, the authors mention using datasets from the UCI repository for testing contextual bandit algorithms. This indicates that there are specific datasets utilized for their experiments in this context.

Now, I will compile the datasets identified:

1. **Custom Offline Dataset**: This dataset consists of 100,000 transitions generated by a soft-actor critic (SAC) agent. It is used for testing the Implicit Q-learning (IQL) algorithm on continuous control tasks. The authors do not provide a specific name for this dataset, but it is derived from their own experiments.

2. **UCI Datasets**: The authors mention using datasets from the UCI repository for their contextual bandit benchmarks. While they do not specify which datasets from UCI were used, I will note that they are leveraging publicly available datasets for their experiments.

Next, I will look into the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned:

- For the **D4RL** dataset creation, the relevant citation is:
  > Justin Fu, Aviral Kumar, Ofir Nachum, George Tucker, and Sergey Levine. *D4RL: Datasets for Deep Data-Driven Reinforcement Learning*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2004.07219, 2020.

- For the **UCI repository**, the citation is:
  > Arthur Asuncion and David Newman. *UCI Machine Learning Repository*. 2007.

Now, I will summarize the findings:

1. **Custom Offline Dataset** (100k transitions from SAC):
   - Citation: Derived from the authors' experiments, no specific citation provided.

2. **UCI Datasets**:
   - Citation: Asuncion, A., & Newman, D. (2007). *UCI Machine Learning Repository*.

Finally, I will ensure that I have documented the datasets clearly, including their context and citations, ready for any further processing or review.
