To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Vehicle-to-Vehicle Charging: Model, Complexity, and Heuristics" by Cl√°udio Gomes et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental results sections** to look for any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research but may not mention specific datasets. The introduction may contain context about existing datasets or benchmarks relevant to the study.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, as it often details the experimental setup and may explicitly mention datasets used for simulations or evaluations. If the authors describe any datasets used for their experiments, I will take note of their names, characteristics, and any relevant details.

After identifying potential datasets, I will check the **experiments section** to confirm that these datasets were indeed utilized in the research. This section typically provides insights into how the datasets were applied and may include performance metrics or comparisons.

Once I have identified the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research. I will look for any papers or sources that describe the datasets in detail.

If the paper mentions any datasets without providing full citations, I will note these instances and attempt to find the original sources through external searches or by checking the references cited in the paper.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and accompanied by its full citation. This will include the dataset name, a brief description, and the citation formatted according to academic standards.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets referenced in the paper, providing a comprehensive overview for future reference or analysis.
