To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MC2: Multi-concept Guidance for Customized Multi-concept Generation" by Jiaxiu Jiang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions "extensive experiments" and refers to a dataset called **CustomConcept101**, which is a strong indication that datasets are discussed in the paper.

Next, I will look closely at **section 4.1 (Experiment Setup)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they describe the **CustomConcept101 dataset**, which consists of 101 concepts and unique compositions among these concepts, and also mention a benchmark dataset for compositional generation that includes 276 prompts.

In this section, I will note the details provided about the **CustomConcept101 dataset**:
- It contains 101 concepts, each with 3 to 15 images.
- Each composition involves two concepts, accompanied by 12 prompts.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the **CustomConcept101 dataset**. The citation is as follows:
> Kumari, N., Zhang, B., Zhang, R., Shechtman, E., & Zhu, J.Y. (2023). Multi-concept customization of text-to-image diffusion. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pp. 1931â€“1941.

Additionally, I will verify if there are any other datasets mentioned in the paper. The authors refer to a benchmark dataset for compositional generation, but they do not provide a specific name or citation for it. Since it is not explicitly named or cited, I will not include it in my dataset extraction.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entry for **CustomConcept101** with its full citation. This ensures that I have accurately documented the dataset used in the research.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry in the required format for further processing or review.
