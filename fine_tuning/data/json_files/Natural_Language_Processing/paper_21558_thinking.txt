To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Intention-Aware Control Based on Belief-Space Specifications and Stochastic Expansion" by Zengjie Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental studies sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the development of a controller for autonomous vehicles but does not mention specific datasets. I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine **section V (Experimental Studies)**, as this section typically contains details about the datasets used for experiments. In this section, the authors describe two autonomous driving cases: an overtaking case and an intersection case. They mention that the experiments were programmed in Python and solved using specific toolboxes, but I need to check if they reference any datasets.

Upon reviewing the experimental studies, I find that the authors do not explicitly mention any datasets by name. However, they refer to the use of simulation environments and tools, such as the stlpy and chaospy toolboxes, which may imply that they used synthetic data generated for their experiments rather than publicly available datasets.

Since no specific datasets are cited in the paper, I will check the **References section** to see if any prior works are referenced that might contain datasets relevant to the experiments. However, the references primarily cite other research papers and do not provide direct links to datasets.

Given that the paper does not provide explicit datasets or their citations, I will summarize my findings as follows:

1. **No specific datasets were mentioned** in the abstract, introduction, or experimental sections.
2. The experiments utilized simulation environments and tools, but no publicly available datasets were cited.
3. The references do not lead to any datasets directly related to the experiments conducted in this paper.

In conclusion, I will note that while the paper discusses experimental setups, it does not provide specific datasets or their citations, which limits the ability to document datasets in the required format. If future research or supplementary materials become available, they may provide the necessary dataset information.
