To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Task-adaptive Pre-training of Language Models with Word Embedding Regularization" by Kosuke Nishida et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and evaluation sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their method on two datasets, which suggests that I should look for their names and details.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Evaluation)**, particularly **subsection 4.1 (Dataset)**, where the authors provide a summary of the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they mention:

1. **BioASQ**: This is a question answering dataset in the biomedical domain. The authors reference the original work by Tsatsaronis et al. (2015) for this dataset.

2. **SQuAD1.1**: This dataset is used for question answering and is based on Wikipedia. The authors cite Rajpurkar et al. (2016) as the source for this dataset.

In the **table provided in section 4.1**, I will note the statistics for both datasets, including the number of training and evaluation samples, as well as the corpus size.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **BioASQ**, the citation is:
  > George Tsatsaronis, Georgios Balikas, Prodromos Malakasiotis, Ioannis Partalas, Matthias Zschunke, Michael R Alvers, Dirk Weissenborn, Anastasia Krithara, Sergios Petridis, Dimitris Polychronopoulos, Yannis Almirantis, John Pavlopoulos, Nicolas Baskiotis, Patrick Gallinari, Thierry Artieres, Axel Ngonga, Norman Heino, Eric Gaussier, Liliana Barrio-Alvers, Michael Schroeder, Ion Androutsopoulos, and Georgios Paliouras. *An overview of the BIOASQ large-scale biomedical semantic indexing and question answering competition*. BMC Bioinformatics, 16:138, 2015.

- For **SQuAD1.1**, the citation is:
  > Pranav Rajpurkar, Jian Zhang, Konstantin Lopyrev, and Percy Liang. *SQuAD: 100,000+ questions for machine comprehension of text*. In Proceedings of the 2016 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), pages 2383â€“2392, 2016.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
