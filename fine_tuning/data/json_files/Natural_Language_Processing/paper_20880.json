        "dcterms:description": "The dataset comprises recordings from nine distinct power grids, each labeled from AAA to III. Recordings from grids AAA, CCC, and III include a 60 Hz ENF signal, while the remaining grids feature a 50 Hz nominal ENF. Audio recordings are included from a variety of settings, and power recordings are obtained through a special circuit, with durations varying from 30 to 60 minutes. The power recordings contain inherently stronger ENF traces, whereas audio recordings exhibit a higher degree of noise.",
