To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Diversity Preferences, Affirmative Action and Choice Rules" by Oğuzhan Çelebi, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on diversity preferences and choice rules, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. The introduction elaborates on various institutions and their approaches to diversity, but again, it does not specify any datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **experiments**. In this paper, there is no clear section labeled "Datasets," but I will check the **methodology** and **analysis** sections for any references to data sources or datasets used in the research.

Upon reviewing the **related literature** and **references**, I will look for any datasets that might be cited or referenced indirectly. For example, the paper discusses various studies and mechanisms related to affirmative action and diversity, which may have associated datasets.

If I find any datasets mentioned, I will note their names, descriptions, and any relevant details provided in the text. I will also check the **References section** for full citations of these datasets. It is crucial to ensure that I capture the complete citation for each dataset, as this will be important for proper attribution and further research.

For instance, if the paper references a dataset like the "Indian Government Job Allocation Dataset," I will look for the original source or publication that describes this dataset in detail. The citation might look something like this:
> Author(s). *Title of the Dataset*. Year. Publisher/Source.

Finally, I will compile all identified datasets along with their full citations into a structured format for easy reference. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the necessary information for each dataset mentioned in the paper.
