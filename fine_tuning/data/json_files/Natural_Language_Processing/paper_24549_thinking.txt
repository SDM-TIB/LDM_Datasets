To extract datasets from the research paper titled "LLMs as for Doctors: Leveraging Medical LLMs to Assist Doctors, Not Replace Them" by Wenya Xie et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates the creation of a Chinese medical dataset called **DoctorFLAN**, which is a strong lead for dataset extraction.

Next, I will look into the **section 3 (Dataset Construction)**, where the authors describe the construction of **DoctorFLAN** in detail. They mention that this dataset includes 92K Q&A samples from 22 tasks and 27 specialists. This section will provide specific details about the dataset's structure and purpose.

Additionally, I will check for any other datasets mentioned in the paper. The authors also introduce **DotaBench**, which is designed for evaluating LLMs in multi-turn conversation scenarios. This dataset contains 74 multi-turn conversations, which is crucial for understanding the evaluation framework.

I will also look for any references to other datasets in the **related work** or **appendices** sections. The paper mentions several existing datasets such as **HealthCareMagic100k**, **ChatDoctor10k**, and **MedDialog**, which are relevant to the context of medical LLMs.

Now, I will compile the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper:

1. **DoctorFLAN**: 
   - This dataset is constructed specifically for the study and does not have a separate citation but is described in detail in the paper.

2. **DotaBench**: 
   - Similar to DoctorFLAN, this dataset is also created for the purposes of this research and does not have an external citation.

3. **HealthCareMagic100k**: 
   > Li, K., et al. *HealthCareMagic100k: A Dataset for Medical Question Answering*. Available at: https://github.com/Kent0n-Li/ChatDoctor

4. **ChatDoctor10k**: 
   > Li, K., et al. *ChatDoctor10k: A Medical Chat Model Fine-tuned on Llama Model Using Medical Domain Knowledge*. Available at: https://github.com/Kent0n-Li/ChatDoctor

5. **MedDialog**: 
   > Zeng, G., et al. *MedDialog: Large-scale Medical Dialogue Datasets*. In Proceedings of the 2020 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), pages 9241â€“9250. Available at: https://github.com/UCSD-AI4H/Medical-Dialogue-System

After gathering this information, I will ensure that I have accurately captured the essence of each dataset, including their purpose and the context in which they are used in the paper. This will allow me to create a comprehensive overview of the datasets relevant to the research conducted by the authors.
