To extract datasets from the research paper titled "NLLG Quarterly arXiv Report 06/23: What are the most influential current AI Papers?" by Steffen Eger et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the report's purpose, but I need to look for specific datasets in the methodology and results sections.

In the **methodology section**, the authors describe two datasets they created: **arxiv-0623** and **arxiv-0623-top40**. They provide details about these datasets, including their size, time period, and primary categories. This is crucial information for my extraction.

Next, I will note the specifics of each dataset:

1. **arxiv-0623**: This dataset contains 20,843 papers collected from arXiv between January 1, 2023, and June 30, 2023, focusing on the categories cs.CL (computation and language) and cs.LG (machine learning).

2. **arxiv-0623-top40**: This dataset includes the top 40 papers based on normalized citation counts from the same time period.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets. However, since these datasets are created by the authors of the paper, they may not have separate citations in the traditional sense. Instead, I will cite the paper itself as the source of the datasets.

The citation for the paper is:
> Steffen Eger, Christoph Leiter, Jonas Belouadi, Ran Zhang, Aida Kostikova, Daniil Larionov, Yanran Chen, Vivian Fresen. *NLLG Quarterly arXiv Report 06/23: What are the most influential current AI Papers?* Natural Language Learning Group (NLLG), Bielefeld University, 2023. Available at: https://nl2g.github.io/

With this information, I can now compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citation for the source of the datasets. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets extracted from the paper.
