To extract datasets from the research paper titled "FasterViT: Fast Vision Transformers with Hierarchical Attention" by Ali Hatamizadeh et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. In the abstract, the authors mention that they validated their model on various computer vision tasks, which suggests that multiple datasets are involved. I will look for specific names of datasets mentioned in these sections.

Next, I will proceed to the **experiments section** (which is typically where datasets are discussed in detail). In this paper, the authors mention using several datasets for validation, including:

1. **ImageNet-1K**: This dataset is used for image classification tasks. The authors note that it includes 1.2 million training images across 1,000 categories.
2. **MS COCO**: This dataset is utilized for object detection and instance segmentation tasks. It is a well-known dataset in the computer vision community.
3. **ADE20K**: This dataset is employed for semantic segmentation tasks. It is also a widely recognized dataset in the field.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations I will extract are:

- For **ImageNet-1K**:
  > Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, and Li Fei-Fei. *ImageNet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In 2009 IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pp. 248–255, 2009.

- For **MS COCO**:
  > Tsung-Yi Lin, Priya Goyal, Ross Girshick, Kaiming He, and Piotr Dollár. *Microsoft COCO: Common objects in context*. In ECCV, 2014.

- For **ADE20K**:
  > Bolei Zhou, Hang Zhao, Xavier Puig, Sanja Fidler, Adela Barriuso, and Antonio Torralba. *Scene parsing through ADE20K dataset*. In Proceedings of the IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pp. 633–641, 2017.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their proper citations.
