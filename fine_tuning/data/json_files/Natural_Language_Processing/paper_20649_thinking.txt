To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Picture Is Worth a Graph: Blueprint Debate on Graph for Multimodal Reasoning" by Changmeng Zheng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments validating their proposed method, which suggests that datasets were used. I will look for any specific names or descriptions of datasets in these sections.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 5), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they mention two datasets:

1. **ScienceQA-IMG (SQA-IMG)**: This dataset is described as the first multimodal scientific question-answering corpus comprising 21,000 inquiries paired with multiple choices and accompanying images. It is important to note that the authors specify they used the TEST and DEV partitions of this dataset.

2. **MMBench**: This dataset is mentioned as a systematic and robust means for reasoning evaluation, and the authors used the official data split (MMBench-Dev) for their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution:

- For **ScienceQA-IMG**, the citation is:
  > Pan Lu, Swaroop Mishra, Tanglin Xia, Liang Qiu, Kai-Wei Chang, Song-Chun Zhu, Oyvind Tafjord, Peter Clark, and Ashwin Kalyan. *Learn to explain: Multimodal reasoning via thought chains for science question answering*. Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 35 (2022), 2507â€“2521.

- For **MMBench**, the citation is:
  > Yuan Liu, Haodong Duan, Yuanhan Zhang, Bo Li, Songyang Zhang, Wangbo Zhao, Yike Yuan, Jiaqi Wang, Conghui He, Ziwei Liu, et al. *MMBench: Is your multi-modal model an all-around player?* arXiv preprint arXiv:2307.06281 (2023).

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
