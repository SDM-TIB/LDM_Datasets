To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Promoting Two-sided Fairness in Dynamic Vehicle Routing Problem" by Rongsheng Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on a "publicly available large-scale ridesharing dataset" and a "parking non-compliance dataset." This indicates that there are at least two datasets that I need to identify.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors describe their experiments in section 5, where they explicitly list the datasets used:

1. **Non-Compliance Synthetic Dataset**: This dataset is generated using Poisson and exponential distributions to simulate non-compliance in parking scenarios. However, since it is synthetic, it may not have a formal citation like real-world datasets.

2. **Melbourne Parking Dataset**: The authors acquired this dataset from the Open Data Platform, which contains 2016 parking events in Melbourne, Australia. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Melbourne. 2016. Car parking data. https://www.melbourne.vic.gov.au/about-council/governance-transparency/open-data/Pages/on-street-parking-data.aspx Accessed May 1, 2022.

3. **New York City Taxi Dataset**: This dataset includes requests raised from different locations in Manhattan, New York City, in 2016. The citation for this dataset is:
   > New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission. 2016. NYC Taxi Data. https://www1.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page Accessed May 1, 2022.

After identifying these datasets, I will ensure to note down their descriptions and any relevant details provided in the paper, such as the context in which they were used and any specific attributes mentioned.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research, ready for further processing or review.
