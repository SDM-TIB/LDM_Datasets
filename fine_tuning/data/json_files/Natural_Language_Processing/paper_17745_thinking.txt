To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Understanding Representation Learnability of Nonlinear Self-Supervised Learning" by Ruofeng Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses self-supervised learning (SSL) and its effectiveness, but does not explicitly mention any datasets. I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**. This section typically contains detailed information about the datasets used for training and evaluation. I will look for any subsections that specifically mention datasets or data distributions.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors describe a **toy data distribution** in section 3.1, which consists of four types of datapoints (D1, D2, D3, D4). These are not standard datasets but rather synthetic data distributions created for the purpose of their experiments. The details are as follows:

1. **D1**: Contains datapoints generated with a specific feature related to labels.
2. **D2**: Similar to D1 but includes hidden features.
3. **D3**: Contains datapoints with negative label-related features.
4. **D4**: Similar to D3 but includes hidden features.

Since these are not publicly available datasets, I will note them as synthetic datasets created for the study.

Next, I will check the **References section** to see if any datasets are cited from other works. However, the paper primarily focuses on the theoretical aspects of SSL and does not reference any established datasets like ImageNet or CIFAR, which are common in machine learning literature.

After gathering this information, I will compile the findings into a structured format. The datasets extracted from the paper are:

- **Synthetic Dataset D1**: A toy dataset designed for the study, containing label-related features.
- **Synthetic Dataset D2**: A toy dataset designed for the study, containing hidden features.
- **Synthetic Dataset D3**: A toy dataset designed for the study, containing negative label-related features.
- **Synthetic Dataset D4**: A toy dataset designed for the study, containing hidden features.

Since these datasets are not standard and do not have formal citations, I will note that they are synthetic datasets created by the authors for the purpose of their experiments.

Finally, I will summarize the findings and ensure that I have documented the nature of the datasets accurately, including the fact that they are synthetic and specific to this research.

In conclusion, I will prepare the dataset entries for review, ensuring clarity on their synthetic nature and the context in which they were used in the research.
