To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A comprehensive survey of research towards AI-enabled unmanned aerial systems in pre-, active-, and post-wildfire management" by Sayed Pedram Haeri Boroujeni et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's focus, and the introduction often highlights key datasets used in the research.

Next, I will look for specific sections that typically contain dataset information, such as **"Datasets," "Methodology," or "Experiments."** In these sections, the authors may describe the datasets used for their analyses, including their sources, sizes, and any relevant characteristics.

As I read through the paper, I will take note of any datasets explicitly mentioned. For example, if the authors refer to datasets like "Flame1," "ForestFire," or "Corsican," I will record these names along with any details provided about them, such as the number of images, types of data (e.g., RGB, multispectral), and the context in which they were used.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. I will look for papers or reports that describe the datasets in detail.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include:
1. The name of the dataset.
2. A brief description of the dataset, including its purpose and characteristics.
3. The full citation for each dataset as found in the References section.

Finally, I will organize this information clearly, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its citation, ready for further processing or review.
