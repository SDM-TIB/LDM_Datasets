To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The Economics of Human Oversight: How Norms and Incentives Affect Costs and Performance of AI Workers" by Johann Laux et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses an experimental study involving 307 data annotators, which suggests that there may be a dataset used for this experiment.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, where the authors describe the experimental design. They mention that participants were tasked with annotating a dataset of 100 images of building entrances, which is a clear indication of a dataset being utilized.

I will also look for any references to the source of these images. In the methodology, the authors state that the images were selected from an existing open-access dataset on accessibility barriers, consisting of 5,538 images. This indicates that there is a primary dataset from which the 100 images were drawn.

Now, I will gather the necessary details for the datasets:

1. **Dataset of 100 images of building entrances**: This dataset was specifically created for the experiment, where participants classified images as either barrier-free or non-barrier-free.

2. **Existing open-access dataset on accessibility barriers**: The authors refer to this dataset as containing 5,538 images of building entrances in public spaces in Central Europe and the UK. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Stolberg, J. (2022). *Accessibility Barriers Dataset*. [Dataset]. Retrieved from [URL or repository if available].

Next, I will ensure that I have the full citation for the dataset used in the experiment. Since the authors did not provide a specific citation for the 100 images, I will note that they were derived from the larger dataset mentioned above.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets referenced in the paper, ready for any further processing or review.
