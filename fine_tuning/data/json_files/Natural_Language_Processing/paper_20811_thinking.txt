To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Integrating Mamba Sequence Model and Hierarchical Upsampling Network for Accurate Semantic Segmentation of Multiple Sclerosis Legion" by Kazi Shahriar Sanjid et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental procedures sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on publicly available MRI scans for Multiple Sclerosis lesion segmentation, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Dataset Description)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention two datasets:

1. **Dataset 1**: This dataset comprises MRI scans from 60 individuals diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis. It includes 3D FLAIR MRI scans, with manual segmentation performed by three experts. The dataset details the demographics of the participants and the imaging conditions.

2. **Dataset 2**: This dataset consists of FLAIR images from 100 individuals with Multiple Sclerosis, obtained from 15 different MRI scanners. It includes images from two time points for each patient, focusing on new lesions identified at the second time point.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Dataset 1**, the citation is:
  > A. M. Muslim, S. Mashohor, G. Al Gawwam, R. Mahmud, M. binti Hanafi, O. Alnuaimi, R. Josephine, and A. D. Almutairi. *Brain MRI dataset of multiple sclerosis with consensus manual lesion segmentation and patient meta information*. Data in Brief, vol. 42, p. 108139, 2022.

- For **Dataset 2**, the citation is:
  > MSSEG-2 challenge proceedings: Multiple sclerosis new lesions segmentation challenge using a data management and processing infrastructure, Strasbourg, France, Sep. 2021. Available at: https://inria.hal.science/hal-03358968.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets and their citations clearly.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its full citation.
