To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On Generating Explanations for Reinforcement Learning Policies: An Empirical Study" by Mikihisa Yuasa et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the effectiveness of the proposed method in two simulated environments: a game of capture the flag and a car-parking environment. This indicates that there may be datasets or environments used for evaluation.

Next, I will examine the **methodology section** to see if the authors provide details about the environments used for their experiments. In the results section, they mention that they demonstrate their method in two environments: the capture the flag (CtF) game and the car-parking scenario. However, I need to check if these environments are based on existing datasets or if they are custom-built simulations.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors do not reference any publicly available datasets but instead describe the environments they created for their experiments. Therefore, I will note that the datasets are not traditional datasets but rather simulated environments designed for the purpose of this study.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to ensure that I capture any relevant citations that may pertain to the environments or methodologies used. The paper cites various works related to reinforcement learning and temporal logic, but it does not provide specific dataset citations since the environments are custom.

In summary, I will document the following:

1. **Capture the Flag (CtF) Game**: A custom-built grid-world environment designed for the experiments in this study.
2. **Car-Parking Scenario**: Another custom-built environment used for testing the proposed method.

Since these are not traditional datasets with formal citations, I will note that there are no specific dataset citations to provide.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity, ensuring that I highlight the nature of the environments used in the study.
