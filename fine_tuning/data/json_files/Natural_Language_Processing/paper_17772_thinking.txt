To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Rastro-DM: data mining with a trail" by Marcus Vinícius Borela de Castro and Remis Balaniuk, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are referenced or described. The abstract mentions a project called "Cladop," which is related to the classification of PDF documents associated with damages to the Brazilian Federal Public Treasury. This suggests that there may be a dataset associated with this project.

Next, I will examine the **methodology** and **results** sections, particularly focusing on the **Cladop project** description in section 4. Here, the authors provide details about the dataset used, specifically stating that **118,266 documents** were considered, which were related to **4,384 damages** distributed into **84 types of documents**. This indicates that the dataset is substantial and relevant for the research.

I will also look for any specific references to the dataset's origin or any associated publications that provide a formal citation. In the **references section**, I will check for any citations that pertain to the dataset used in the Cladop project.

The relevant dataset information I have identified includes:

1. **Cladop Dataset**: This dataset consists of **118,266 documents** related to **4,384 damages** categorized into **84 types of documents**. The dataset is used for the classification of PDF documents in the context of auditing processes.

Now, I will compile the full citation for the dataset. The paper itself serves as the primary source for the dataset, so I will cite it as follows:

- For the **Cladop Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Castro, Marcus Vinícius Borela de. *Mineração de Dados com Rastro: Boas Práticas para Documentação de Processos e sua Aplicação em um Projeto de Classificação Textual*. Conclusion paper of the specialization program on Data Analysis for Auditing. Brazilian Federal Court of Account’s Serzedello Corrêa Institute, Brasília, Brazil. Available at: https://portal.tcu.gov.br/biblioteca-digital/mineracao-de-dados-com-rastro-boas-praticas-para-documentacao-de-processo-e-sua-aplicacao-em-um-projeto-de-classificacao-textual.htm. Accessed on July 26, 2020. 2019.

After gathering this information, I will ensure that it is structured appropriately for any further processing or review. This includes confirming that all relevant details about the dataset are captured accurately and that the citation is complete and correctly formatted.
