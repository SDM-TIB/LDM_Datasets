To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Interpolation of mountain weather forecasts by machine learning" by Kazuma Iwase and Tomoyuki Takenawa, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on improving weather forecasts in mountainous regions, which suggests that datasets related to weather observations and forecasts may be involved.

Next, I will examine **section 4 (Experiments)**, particularly **subsection 4.1 (Data)**, where the authors describe the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention that the experiment aims to predict temperature at the summit of Mt. Fuji and precipitation at Hakone, indicating that these locations are central to the data collection.

In this section, the authors specify that the observation data were collected from the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA), which includes hourly observations for various locations and variables from June 26, 2019, to March 9, 2023. This is a crucial dataset for the study.

Additionally, they mention that hourly forecast data for surrounding areas were obtained from "Weathernews" and "Tenki to Kurasu," covering 144 days from October 16, 2022, to March 8, 2023. This indicates that both observed and forecast datasets are utilized in their analysis.

Now, I will look for the **full citations** for these datasets in the **References section** of the paper. The citations I need to find include:

1. **Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA)**: The authors refer to the JMA for observational data, but they do not provide a specific citation in the references. I will note that this is a government agency and can be cited as:
   > Japan Meteorological Agency. *Meteorological Data*. Available at: https://www.jma.go.jp/jma/indexe.html (accessed 2023-12-11).

2. **Weathernews**: The authors mention that forecast data were scraped from Weathernews. The citation for this source is:
   > Weathernews. *Weather Forecast Services*. Available at: https://Weathernews.jp/ (accessed 2023-12-11).

3. **Tenki to Kurasu**: Similarly, the authors refer to forecast data from Tenki to Kurasu. The citation is:
   > Tenki to Kurasu. *Weather Forecast Services*. Available at: https://tenkura.n-kishou.co.jp/tk/ (accessed 2023-12-11).

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
