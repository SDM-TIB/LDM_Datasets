To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Machine-assisted mixed methods: augmenting humanities and social sciences with artificial intelligence" by Andres Karjus, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the paper showcases **16 machine-assisted case studies** across various languages and disciplines, which suggests that multiple datasets are likely involved. I will look for specific mentions of datasets or data sources in these sections.

Next, I will proceed to the **results section**, which details the case studies. Each case study is likely to reference specific datasets used for analysis. I will carefully read through each case study to identify the datasets mentioned, noting their names, descriptions, and any relevant details provided by the author.

For each identified dataset, I will also check the **references section** of the paper to find full citations. This is crucial for proper attribution and to ensure that the datasets can be located by others. I will look for any papers or sources that are cited in relation to the datasets.

As I extract the datasets, I will document the following information for each:
1. **Dataset Name**: The official name of the dataset as mentioned in the paper.
2. **Description**: A brief description of the dataset, including its purpose and content.
3. **Citation**: The full citation for the dataset, formatted according to academic standards.

I will ensure that I capture all relevant datasets mentioned throughout the paper, particularly in the results and methods sections, as these are likely to contain detailed information about the datasets used in the case studies.

Finally, I will compile all the extracted datasets into a structured format, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and citation, ready for further processing or review.
