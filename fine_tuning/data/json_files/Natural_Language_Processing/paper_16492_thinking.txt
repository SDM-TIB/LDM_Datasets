To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Coloring the Past: Neural Historical Buildings Reconstruction from Archival Photography" by D´avid Komorowicz et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and datasets sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the introduction of a new historical dataset, which indicates that there is at least one dataset to extract.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the significance of historical buildings and the challenges in reconstructing their 3D models from archival photographs. They also mention the need for datasets that can aid in this reconstruction, which reinforces the expectation of dataset details in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Historical Dataset)**, where the authors explicitly introduce the **Hungarian National Theater dataset**. This section provides detailed information about the dataset, including the number of images, the time period during which the images were taken, and the types of images (color vs. gray-scale). The dataset consists of 229 images directly released by the authors and an additional 136 images for which access links are provided. The authors also mention that the dataset includes a dense point cloud and camera poses registered using Structure from Motion (SfM).

I will also note that the authors reference three other historical datasets in **Table 1**, which includes the **Hotel International**, **Observatory**, and **St. Michael Church** datasets. Each of these datasets is cited as being from a previous work by Maiwald et al. (2023), which I will need to include in the citations.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The Hungarian National Theater dataset is newly introduced in this paper, so I will cite it as follows:

- **Hungarian National Theater Dataset**:
  > D´avid Komorowicz, Lu Sang, Ferdinand Maiwald, and Daniel Cremers. *Coloring the Past: Neural Historical Buildings Reconstruction from Archival Photography*. In Proceedings of the [Conference Name], [Year]. [Link if available].

For the other datasets referenced from Maiwald et al. (2023), I will find the citation for that paper:

- **Hotel International Dataset**:
  > Ferdinand Maiwald, D´avid Komorowicz, Iqra Munir, Clemens Beck, and Sander M¨unster. *Semi-automatic generation of historical urban 3D models at a larger scale using structure-from-motion, neural rendering and historical maps*. In Proceedings of the [Conference Name], [Year]. [Link if available].

- **Observatory Dataset**:
  > Same citation as above.

- **St. Michael Church Dataset**:
  > Same citation as above.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, which is essential for reproducibility and further research in the field.
