To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Paths of A Million People: Extracting Life Trajectories from Wikipedia" by Ying Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and dataset sections** to locate any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors created a hand-curated dataset called **WikiLifeTrajectory**, which consists of 8,852 (person, time, location) triplets. This is a clear indication that a dataset is present.

Next, I will examine the **Dataset section** in detail, where the authors describe how they constructed the **WikiLifeTrajectory dataset**. They mention that it consists of two manually annotated datasets: "Regular" and "Representative." 

1. **WikiLifeTrajectory Dataset**: This dataset is the primary focus of the paper and is described as containing 8,852 triplets of (person, time, location). The authors also mention that they have made this dataset publicly available, which is crucial for reproducibility and further research.

In the **Data Collection** subsection, the authors explain that the data is sourced from biography pages of the English Wikipedia, which adds context to the dataset's origin.

In the **Data Processing and Labeling** subsection, they detail the methodology used to extract and annotate the triplets, confirming the dataset's structure and the process behind its creation.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. Since the dataset is newly created by the authors, it may not have a traditional citation like other datasets. However, the authors do mention that the dataset will be made publicly available, which is important for future reference.

The citation for the dataset can be structured as follows:
- **WikiLifeTrajectory Dataset**: 
  > Ying Zhang, Xiaofeng Li, Zhaoyang Liu, Haipeng Zhang. *Paths of A Million People: Extracting Life Trajectories from Wikipedia*. In Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, 2022. Available at: https://github.com/ZhangDataLab/COSMOS

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format that highlights the dataset's name, description, and citation. This will ensure that the dataset is properly documented for future use and reference.
