To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Automatic Difficulty Classification of Arabic Sentences" by Nouran Khallaf and Serge Sharoff, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the paper presents a sentence difficulty classifier and mentions the use of various sentence embeddings and linguistic features, but it does not specify any datasets at this point.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section. Here, the authors discuss the challenges of measuring text readability and the importance of sentence-level difficulty assessment. They mention the need for a readability sentence classifier for Arabic, but again, no specific datasets are named.

Moving on to **section 2 (Corpora and Tools)**, I will focus on the subsections that describe the datasets. The authors explicitly mention two datasets:

1. **Dataset One: Sentence-level annotation**: This dataset is compiled from three sources:
   - The **Gloss1 Corpus** developed by the Defense Language Institute, which is treated as a gold standard for readability classification.
   - The **Arabic Learner Corpus (ALC)**, which consists of texts produced by Arabic learners in Saudi Arabia, annotated with proficiency levels.
   - Texts from the textbook **"Al-Kitaab fi TaAallum al-Arabiyya"**, which are classified according to ACTFL guidelines.

   The authors also mention a counterpart corpus of Arabic web pages collected through web crawling, referred to as **I-AR**.

2. **Dataset Two: Simplification examples**: This dataset consists of 2980 parallel sentences compiled from the Arabic novel **"Saaq al-Bambuu"** by Saud Al-Sanousi, which has an authorized simplified version for language learners.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Gloss1 Corpus**, the citation is:
  > Forsyth, J. N. (2014). *Automatic readability prediction for modern standard Arabic*. Ph.D. thesis, Brigham Young University.

- For the **Arabic Learner Corpus (ALC)**, the citation is:
  > Alfaiﬁ, A., & Atwell, E. S. (2013). Arabic learner corpus v1: A new resource for Arabic language research. In Proceedings of the Second Workshop on Arabic Corpus Linguistics (WACL-2). Leeds.

- For the **"Al-Kitaab fi TaAallum al-Arabiyya"**, the citation is:
  > Brustad, K., Al-Batal, M., & Al-Tonsi, A. (2015). *Al-Kitaab fi Tacallum al-cArabiyya. A Textbook for Beginning Arabic: Part One Third Edition*. Georgetown University Press.

- For the **I-AR corpus**, the citation is:
  > Sharoff, S. (2006). Open-source corpora: using the net to fish for linguistic data. *International Journal of Corpus Linguistics*, 11(4), 435-462.

- For the **"Saaq al-Bambuu"**, the citation is:
  > Al-Sanousi, S. (2013). *Saaq al-Bambuu*. Arab Scientific Publishers Inc., Lebanon.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research paper along with their full citations.
