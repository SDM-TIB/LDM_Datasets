To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Three Ways of Using Large Language Models to Evaluate Chat" by Ondřej Plátek et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to find any references to datasets. The abstract mentions participation in the **DSTC 11 Track 4 competition**, which indicates that datasets are likely involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Task & Data)**, where the authors describe the datasets provided for the competition. Here, they mention several datasets:

1. **Training set**: Consists of 390k dialogues annotated with sentiment and toxicity labels. This dataset was not used in their experiments.

2. **Development set**: Comprises 24 datasets, some annotated with dataset-specific metrics. The authors created a heuristic mapping to the target metrics on a subset of this development set.

3. **Test set**: Contains 3,470 dialogues and 130k turns, annotated with target metrics. This dataset was published in an anonymized form after the challenge.

4. **Rehearsal set**: A set of 156 turns collected similarly to the test set, which was manually annotated with target metrics and used for hyperparameter search.

In addition, the authors reference specific datasets used in their experiments, such as:

- **DailyDialog**: A dataset used for developing prompt templates.
- **Fed-Turn**: Another dataset mentioned in the context of training.
- **Persona-See** and **Persona-Usr**: Datasets used for training the feed-forward network.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. The citations I need to extract include:

- For **DailyDialog**:
  > Li, Y., Su, H., Shen, X., Li, W., Cao, Z., & Niu, S. (2017). DailyDialog: A Manually Labelled Multi-turn Dialogue Dataset. ArXiv:1710.03957 [cs].

- For **Fed-Turn**:
  > Mehri, S., & Eskenazi, M. (2020). Unsupervised Evaluation of Interactive Dialog with DialoGPT. In Proceedings of the 21th Annual Meeting of the Special Interest Group on Discourse and Dialogue, pages 225–235.

- For **Persona-See**:
  > See, A., Roller, S., Kiela, D., & Weston, J. (2019). What makes a good conversation? How controllable attributes affect human judgments. In Proceedings of the 2019 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, Volume 1 (Long and Short Papers), pages 1702–1723.

- For **Persona-Usr**:
  > Mehri, S., & Eskenazi, M. (2020). USR: An Unsupervised and Reference Free Evaluation Metric for Dialog Generation. In Proceedings of the 58th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, pages 681–707.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This structured approach will help ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations from the paper.
