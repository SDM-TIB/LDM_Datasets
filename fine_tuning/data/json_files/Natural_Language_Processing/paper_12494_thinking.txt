To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Probabilistic Position Bias Model for Short-Video Recommendation Feeds" by Olivier Jeunen, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental results sections** to find any references to datasets. The abstract provides a general overview of the research but may not specify datasets. The introduction often discusses the context and motivation, which might hint at the datasets used.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly where the author discusses the empirical validation of the proposed model. Here, the author mentions using "interventional data with logged views, ranks, and contexts" but does not specify any publicly available datasets. This indicates that the research relies on proprietary datasets, which may not be explicitly named.

In the **experimental results section**, the author states that they obtained a sample of "1 million sessions of feed view events on a social media platform," collected over five days in February 2023. This is a significant dataset, but again, it is not publicly available, and the specific platform is not named.

Since the paper does not provide full citations for any datasets, I will note that the author mentions the use of proprietary data and that they will release an open-source Jupyter notebook for reproducing results, which may not constitute a formal dataset citation.

Finally, I will compile the findings regarding the datasets into a structured format, ensuring to highlight that the datasets used are proprietary and not publicly available, and that no formal citations can be provided for them. 

In summary, the key points regarding datasets from this paper are:
1. The research relies on proprietary datasets, specifically "1 million sessions of feed view events on a social media platform."
2. No specific dataset names or citations are provided in the paper.
3. The author mentions releasing a Jupyter notebook for reproducing results, which may contain code or methods but not formal datasets.

This approach ensures that I accurately capture the essence of the datasets discussed in the paper, even if they are not formally cited.
