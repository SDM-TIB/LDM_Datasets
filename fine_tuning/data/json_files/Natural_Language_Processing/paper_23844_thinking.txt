To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Asynchronous Voice Anonymization Using Adversarial Perturbation On Speaker Embedding" by Rui Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that experiments were conducted on the **LibriSpeech dataset**, which suggests that this dataset is crucial for the research.

Next, I will look closely at **section 4.1 (Dataset & configurations)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they state that the experiments were conducted on the **LibriSpeech corpus**, specifically using the **dev-clean** and **test-clean** datasets. This section provides essential details about the datasets utilized in their research.

To ensure I have the correct citations, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. The citation for the **LibriSpeech dataset** is as follows:
> V. Panayotov, G. Chen, D. Povey, and S. Khudanpur. *LibriSpeech: an ASR corpus based on public domain audio books*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP), pages 5206â€“5210, 2015.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the findings:

1. **LibriSpeech Dataset**: This dataset is used for automatic speech recognition (ASR) tasks and includes various subsets, specifically the **dev-clean** and **test-clean** datasets, which were mentioned in the experiments.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that highlights the dataset and its citation, ensuring that all details are accurately represented for future reference or processing.
