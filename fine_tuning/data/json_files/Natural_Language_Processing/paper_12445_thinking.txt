To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On the Learning Dynamics of Attention Networks" by Rahul Vashisht and Harish G. Ramaswamy, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the datasets used for experiments.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention that they demonstrate their hybrid approach on a collection of semi-synthetic and real-world datasets. This indicates that there are datasets involved, but I need to find their specific names.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors describe their experiments on several datasets, including:

1. **CIFAR10**: A well-known dataset for image classification tasks, consisting of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class.
2. **CIFAR100**: Similar to CIFAR10 but with 100 classes, each containing 600 images.
3. **HateXplain**: A dataset used for classifying text into categories such as hate speech, offensive, or normal, which also includes explanations for the assigned labels.
4. **MSCOCO**: A dataset for image captioning, which includes images and their corresponding captions.

In the **results section**, the authors provide performance metrics for their models on these datasets, confirming their use in the experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **CIFAR10**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. Technical Report 0, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, 2009.

- For **CIFAR100**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. Technical Report 0, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, 2009.

- For **HateXplain**, the citation is:
  > Binny Mathew, Punyajoy Saha, Seid Muhie Yimam, Chris Biemann, Pawan Goyal, and Animesh Mukherjee. *Hatexplain: A benchmark dataset for explainable hate speech detection*. Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, 35(17), 14867â€“14875, 2021.

- For **MSCOCO**, the citation is:
  > Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, Serge Belongie, et al. *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. In European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), 2014.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation, ready for structured output or further processing.
