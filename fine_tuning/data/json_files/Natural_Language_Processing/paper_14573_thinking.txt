To extract datasets from the research paper titled "GRAPES: Learning to Sample Graphs for Scalable Graph Neural Networks" by Taraneh Younesian et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method on various node classification benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 5) where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they mention several datasets categorized into homophilous and heterophilous graphs. I will take note of each dataset mentioned along with any relevant details provided.

The paper lists the following datasets:

1. **Homophilous Graphs**:
   - **Cora**: A citation network dataset.
   - **Citeseer**: Another citation network dataset.
   - **Pubmed**: A dataset of scientific publications.
   - **Reddit**: A social network dataset.
   - **DBLP**: A bibliographic dataset for computer science.
   - **Flickr**: A social media dataset.
   - **ogbn-arxiv**: A dataset from the Open Graph Benchmark.
   - **ogbn-products**: Another dataset from the Open Graph Benchmark.
   - **DBLP**: A bibliographic dataset for computer science.

2. **Heterophilous Graphs**:
   - **Flickr**: A social media dataset.
   - **Yelp**: A dataset containing reviews and ratings.
   - **ogbn-proteins**: A dataset for protein-protein interaction.
   - **BlogCat**: A dataset for blog categorization.
   - **snap-patents**: A dataset of patent citations.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The paper may not provide all citations directly, but I will look for the original sources or relevant papers that describe these datasets.

For example, I can find citations for:
- **Cora**:

- **Citeseer**:

- **ogbn-arxiv** and **ogbn-products**:

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its full citation. This structured approach will help in maintaining clarity and completeness in the dataset extraction process.
