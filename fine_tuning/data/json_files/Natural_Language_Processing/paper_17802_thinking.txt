To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Rule-Guided Joint Embedding Learning over Knowledge Graphs" by Qisong Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors validate their model performance on two established benchmark datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 3), particularly **subsection 3.1**, where the authors introduce the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they explicitly mention two datasets: **FB15K-237** and **WN18**. I will take note of the details provided about these datasets, including their statistics such as the number of relations, entities, training, validation, and test samples.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The paper cites the datasets as follows:

1. **FB15K-237**: The citation is:
   > Toutanova, K., & Chen, D. (2015). Observed Versus Latent Features for Knowledge Base and Text Inference. In Proceedings of the 3rd Workshop on Continuous Vector Space Models and Their Compositionality (pp. 57-66). Stroudsburg, PA: ACL.

2. **WN18**: The citation is:
   > Bordes, A., Usunier, N., Garcia-Duran, A., Weston, J., & Yakhnenko, O. (2013). Translating Embeddings for Modeling Multi-Relational Data. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS 2013) (pp. 2787-2795). Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

- **FB15K-237**: A knowledge graph dataset with 237 relations and 14,541 entities, containing 271,115 training samples, 17,535 validation samples, and 20,466 test samples.
- **WN18**: Another knowledge graph dataset with 18 relations and 40,943 entities, consisting of 141,442 training samples, 2,500 validation samples, and 2,500 test samples.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly presents each dataset along with its citation, ensuring that all details are accurately captured for future reference or processing.
