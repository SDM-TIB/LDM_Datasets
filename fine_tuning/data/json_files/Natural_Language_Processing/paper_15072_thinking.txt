To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Adversarial Training for Physics-Informed Neural Networks" by Yao Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the methods and results, which may include references to datasets used for validation.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. I will look for specific mentions of datasets, including their names, characteristics, and any relevant details that indicate how they were utilized in the research.

In this paper, the authors discuss several equations and problems they applied their method to, such as the elliptic equation, Poisson equation, Burgers’ equation, and the Allen-Cahn equation. However, they do not explicitly mention any publicly available datasets in the text. Instead, they describe the mathematical problems and their solutions, which suggests that the experiments were conducted on synthetic data generated based on these equations rather than on established datasets.

Since no specific datasets are cited, I will check the **References section** for any papers that might describe datasets related to the equations discussed. However, it appears that the focus is on the methodology rather than on using external datasets.

Given that the paper does not provide explicit datasets, I will summarize the findings as follows:

1. **Synthetic Data**: The experiments were conducted using synthetic data generated from the mathematical equations discussed (e.g., elliptic, Poisson, Burgers’, and Allen-Cahn equations). No external datasets were referenced.

2. **No Full Citations Available**: Since no specific datasets were mentioned, there are no citations to provide.

In conclusion, while the paper presents significant findings regarding the application of adversarial training to physics-informed neural networks, it does not reference any external datasets. Therefore, I will document this observation and prepare to summarize the findings without specific dataset citations.
