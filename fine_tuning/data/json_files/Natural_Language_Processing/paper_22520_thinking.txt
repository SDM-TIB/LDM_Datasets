To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-level Shared Knowledge Guided Learning for Knowledge Graph Completion" by Yongxue Shan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the proposed method is evaluated on three well-known datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section (Section 4)**, specifically **subsection 4.1 (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they mention:

1. **WN18RR**: A subset of WordNet containing about 41,000 entities and 11 semantic relations. This dataset is used for knowledge graph completion tasks.
2. **FB15k-237**: A subset of FreeBase consisting of approximately 15,000 entities and 237 relations, also utilized for knowledge graph completion.
3. **Wikidata5M**: A large dataset integrating the Wikidata knowledge graph and Wikipedia pages, comprising nearly 5 million entities and about 20 million triples.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide additional context about these datasets, including their statistics and the specific tasks they are used for, which reinforces their relevance to the study.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **WN18RR**, the citation is:
  > Tim Dettmers, Pasquale Minervini, Pontus Stenetorp, and Sebastian Riedel. *Convolutional 2D knowledge graph embeddings*. In Proceedings of the Thirty-Second AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Thirtieth Innovative Applications of Artificial Intelligence Conference and Eighth AAAI Symposium on Educational Advances in Artificial Intelligence, volume 32 of AAAI’18/IAAI’18/EAAI’18, pages 1811–1818, 2018.

- For **FB15k-237**, the citation is:
  > Kristina Toutanova and Danqi Chen. *Observed versus latent features for knowledge base and text inference*. In Proceedings of the 3rd Workshop on Continuous Vector Space Models and their Compositionality, pages 57–66, Beijing, China, 2015.

- For **Wikidata5M**, the citation is:
  > Liang Wang, Wei Zhao, Zhuoyu Wei, and Jingming Liu. *KEPLER: A unified model for knowledge embedding and pre-trained language representation*. Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics, 9:176–194, 2021.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
