To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Generative Topological Networks" by Alona Levy-Jurgenson and Zohar Yakhini, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any datasets mentioned. The authors state that they demonstrate the strengths of GTNs on several datasets, specifically mentioning **MNIST**, **CelebA**, and the **Hands and Palm Images dataset**. This indicates that these datasets are likely to be discussed in more detail later in the paper.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for any additional context or details about these datasets. The introduction provides a general overview of generative models and their applications, but it does not introduce new datasets.

I will then focus on the **experiments section** where the authors describe their methodology and the datasets used for training and evaluation. Here, they confirm the use of **MNIST**, **CelebA**, and the **Hands and Palm Images dataset**. I will look for specific details about each dataset, such as the number of samples, dimensions, and any preprocessing steps taken.

1. **MNIST Dataset**: The authors mention using the MNIST dataset, which is a well-known dataset of handwritten digits. The citation for this dataset is:
   > LeCun, Y.; Bottou, L.; Bengio, Y.; and Haffner, P. (1998). *Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition*. Proceedings of the IEEE, 86(11): 2278–2324.

2. **CelebA Dataset**: The paper discusses the CelebA dataset, which contains celebrity images with various attributes. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Liu, Z.; Luo, P.; Wang, X.; and Tang, X. (2015). *Deep learning face attributes in the wild*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision, 3730–3738.

3. **Hands and Palm Images Dataset**: The authors also utilize the Hands and Palm Images dataset, which is a smaller dataset containing images of hands. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Kaggle. (2024). *Hands and Palm Images Dataset*. Retrieved from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shyambhu/hands-and-palm-images-dataset.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described with its corresponding citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, which is essential for reproducibility and further research.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for easy reference and potential downstream processing.
