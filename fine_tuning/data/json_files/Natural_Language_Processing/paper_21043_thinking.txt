To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An image speaks a thousand words, but can everyone listen? On image transcreation for cultural relevance" by Simran Khanuja et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the creation of a "two-part evaluation dataset" which indicates that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Evaluation Dataset)**, where the authors describe the two parts of the dataset in detail:

1. **Concept Dataset**: This dataset consists of 600 images collected across seven countries (Brazil, India, Japan, Nigeria, Portugal, Turkey, and the United States). The images are organized around five culturally salient concepts per country, focusing on universal categories like food, beverages, and celebrations.

2. **Application Dataset**: This dataset includes 100 images curated from real-world applications, specifically educational worksheets and children's literature. The authors mention sourcing images from K5 Learning and Bloom Library, which are significant for educational purposes.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned:

- For the **Concept Dataset**, the authors reference the annotation protocol of MaRVL, which is cited as:
  > Liu, F., Chaudhary, A., & Neubig, G. (2021). *Crossing the threshold: Idiomatic machine translation through retrieval augmentation and loss weighting*. In Proceedings of the 2023 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 15095â€“15111, Singapore. Association for Computational Linguistics.

- For the **Application Dataset**, the authors mention:
  > Leong, C., Nemecek, J., Mansdorfer, J., Filighera, A., Owodunni, A., & Whitenack, D. (2022). *Bloom library: Multimodal datasets in 300+ languages for a variety of downstream tasks*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2210.14712.

Next, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ready for review or further processing.
