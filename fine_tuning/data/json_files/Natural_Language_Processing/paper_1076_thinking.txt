To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Natural Alpha Embeddings" by Riccardo Volpi and Luigi Malag√≤, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the work, which may include references to datasets used in the study.

Next, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. These sections typically detail the data used for training and evaluation, and they may provide specific names or descriptions of datasets.

In this paper, I will pay particular attention to any tables or figures that might summarize the datasets or their characteristics. For example, if there are tables showing results from experiments, they might reference the datasets used.

After identifying any datasets mentioned, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial, as proper citation is necessary for academic integrity and for readers who may want to access the datasets themselves.

For instance, if the paper mentions using the **English Wikipedia dump** as a dataset, I would look for the appropriate citation format in the references. If the paper does not provide a specific citation for the dataset, I will need to find the original source or documentation for the dataset to ensure accurate citation.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, including their names, descriptions, and citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset's details.

Finally, I will ensure that each dataset entry includes:
- The name of the dataset
- A brief description of the dataset
- The full citation for the dataset

This structured approach will help me systematically extract and document the datasets referenced in the paper while maintaining academic rigor in citation practices.
