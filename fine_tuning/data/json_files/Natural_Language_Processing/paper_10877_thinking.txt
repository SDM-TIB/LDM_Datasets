To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Writing user personas with Large Language Models" by Stefano De Paoli, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to gather initial insights about any datasets referenced. The abstract mentions a dataset of user interviews used for thematic analysis, which indicates that there is at least one dataset to look for.

Next, I will focus on the **research design and methodology sections** where the author describes the dataset in detail. In the research design section, the author specifies that they used the **farmers’ interviews dataset** from the EUREKA project, which consists of 14 interviews. This dataset is crucial as it serves as the basis for the thematic analysis and subsequent persona generation.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The paper cites the dataset as follows:

- **Farmers’ Interviews Dataset**:
  > Vágó, S., & Spanoghe, P. (2023). EUREKA WP2: Regional Interview Transcripts [Data set]. Zenodo. https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7571028

This citation provides the necessary details about the dataset, including the authors, title, type of resource, and where it can be accessed.

After identifying the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the key characteristics of the dataset, such as the number of interviews, the context of the data collection, and its relevance to the study.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly presents the dataset and its citation, ensuring that it is ready for any further processing or review.
