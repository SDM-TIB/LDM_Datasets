To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Comparing Traditional and LLM-based Search for Image Geolocation" by Stephen MacNeil, Albatool Wazzan, and Richard Souvenir, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on comparing traditional and LLM-based search for image geolocation, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any references to datasets used in the study. The introduction discusses the task of image geolocation and mentions various approaches, but it does not specify any datasets.

Moving on to the **methods section**, I will look for details about the experimental platform and the data used for the study. The authors mention using GeoGuess, an open-source image geolocation game, as the experimental platform. This indicates that the dataset for the study is derived from the gameplay of GeoGuess, but I need to confirm this in the text.

In the **results section**, I will check for any specific datasets referenced in the analysis of the participants' performance. The authors discuss the performance of participants using traditional search versus LLM-based search, but again, they do not mention specific datasets.

Since the paper does not provide explicit datasets or their citations, I will focus on the GeoGuess game as the primary dataset used for the study. I will need to find the full citation for GeoGuess to include it properly.

The citation for GeoGuess is:
> Simon Bilel Jegham, dim fort. 2021. GeoGuess. MIT Licensed. https://github.com/GeoGuess/GeoGuess Accessed: 2023.

Now, I will compile the information about the dataset into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for GeoGuess as the dataset used in this research.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will prepare the dataset entry for review or further processing.
