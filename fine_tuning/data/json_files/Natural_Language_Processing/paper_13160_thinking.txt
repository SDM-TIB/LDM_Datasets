To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Eva-KELLM: A New Benchmark for Evaluating Knowledge Editing of LLMs" by Suhang Wu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the paper introduces a new benchmark and dataset for evaluating knowledge editing in LLMs, which suggests that there may be specific datasets described later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly the parts where the authors discuss their evaluation framework and the datasets used. In this section, they mention constructing a dataset for their benchmark, which is crucial for my extraction.

I will also look for any references to existing datasets used for evaluation, such as **COUNTERFACT**, **FEVER**, and **zsRE**, as these are likely to be important for the context of their research.

In the **results and discussion sections**, I will check if the authors provide any additional details about the datasets, such as their size, structure, or specific use cases in their experiments. This information is essential for a comprehensive understanding of how these datasets contribute to their research.

Now, I will compile the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper:

1. **COUNTERFACT Dataset**: This dataset is referenced multiple times throughout the paper, particularly in the context of knowledge editing. The citation is:
   > Kevin Meng, David Bau, Alex Andonian, and Yonatan Belinkov. *Locating and editing factual associations in gpt*. Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 35:17359–17372, 2022.

2. **FEVER Dataset**: This dataset is mentioned as a commonly used dataset for fact-checking. The citation is:
   > James Thorne, Christos Christodoulopoulos, and Andreas Vlachos. *FEVER: a large-scale dataset for fact extraction and VERification*. In Proceedings of the 2018 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, Volume 1 (Long Papers), pages 809–819, 2018.

3. **zsRE Dataset**: This dataset is referenced in the context of question answering. The citation is:
   > Kevin Meng, Arnab Sen Sharma, Alex Andonian, Yonatan Belinkov, and David Bau. *Mass-editing memory in a transformer*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2210.07229, 2022.

After gathering this information, I will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations, ready for further processing or review. This structured approach will help maintain clarity and ensure that all relevant datasets are documented correctly.
