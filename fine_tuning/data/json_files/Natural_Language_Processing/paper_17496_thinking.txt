To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Knowledge Enhanced Conditional Imputation for Healthcare Time-series" by Linglong Qian et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions a novel approach to handling missing data in healthcare time-series, which suggests that datasets related to healthcare are likely to be discussed. The introduction will provide context and may explicitly mention the datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 5), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, the authors mention four datasets:

1. **eICU Collaborative Research Database**: This is a multi-center database with anonymized hospital patient records. The authors note that it is publicly available after registration and completion of a training course.

2. **MIMIC-III**: This is described as an extensive, freely-available database of over 40,000 critical care patients. The authors extracted different datasets from MIMIC-III for their experiments, specifically mentioning two subsets with 14,188 samples for 89 variables and 21,128 valid samples with 59 variables.

3. **PhysioNet Challenge 2012 dataset**: This dataset contains records of 4,000 48-hour ICU stays and is used for unbiased evaluations of different model performances.

4. **MIMIC-89f and MIMIC-59f**: These are specific subsets of the MIMIC-III dataset mentioned in the context of their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

- For the **eICU Collaborative Research Database**, the citation is:
  > Pollard, T.J., Johnson, A.E., Raffa, J.D., Celi, L.A., Mark, R.G., Badawi, O. (2018). *The eICU collaborative research database, a freely available multi-center database for critical care research*. Scientific Data, 5(1), 1–13.

- For the **MIMIC-III database**, the citation is:
  > Johnson, A., et al. (2016). *MIMIC-III, a freely accessible critical care database*. Scientific Data, 3(1), 1–9.

- For the **PhysioNet Challenge 2012 dataset**, the citation is:
  > Silva, I., Moody, G., Scott, D., Celi, L., Mark, R. (2012). *Predicting in-hospital mortality of ICU patients: The PhysioNet/computing in cardiology challenge 2012*. Computational Cardiology, 39, 245–248.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will facilitate further research and application in the field of healthcare analytics.
