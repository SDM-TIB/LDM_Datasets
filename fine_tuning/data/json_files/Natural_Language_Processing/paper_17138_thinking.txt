To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Single and Multi-Objective Optimization Benchmark Problems Focusing on Human-Powered Aircraft Design" by Nobuo Namura, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** sections to identify any mention of datasets. The abstract introduces benchmark problems but does not specify datasets directly. However, it hints at the availability of source codes, which may imply datasets or problem definitions.

Next, I will examine the **methodology and problem definition sections** (specifically section III) to see if the author describes any datasets used for the benchmark problems. Here, the author outlines the design variables and the construction of benchmark problems but does not explicitly mention any datasets.

I will then look into the **experiments section** to see if any datasets are referenced in the context of the experiments conducted. The author discusses the use of various algorithms for optimization but does not specify datasets.

Finally, I will check the **references section** for any cited datasets. The references primarily focus on previous works related to optimization algorithms and benchmark problems but do not provide specific datasets.

After thoroughly reviewing the paper, it appears that while the author discusses benchmark problems and their definitions, there are no explicit datasets mentioned that can be extracted with full citations. The paper focuses more on the formulation of problems rather than on datasets themselves.

In conclusion, I will note that this paper does not provide specific datasets with citations, but it does offer benchmark problems that can be utilized for optimization research. If I were to summarize the findings, I would state that the paper presents a novel set of benchmark problems for optimization in human-powered aircraft design, but it does not reference any external datasets or provide citations for them.
