To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Run-to-Run Control with Bayesian Optimization for Soft Landing of Short-Stroke Reluctance Actuators" by Eduardo Moya-Lasheras and Carlos Sagues, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or data sources.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any references to datasets used in the experiments or simulations. This section often outlines the context and significance of the research, which may include specific datasets.

I will then focus on the **methodology** section, particularly any subsections that discuss experimental setups or simulations. This is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for validation or testing their proposed methods. I will look for specific names of datasets, their characteristics, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

After that, I will check the **results** section to see if the authors mention any datasets again, especially in the context of the results obtained from their experiments. This can provide additional confirmation of the datasets used.

Finally, I will consult the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned in the paper. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

Based on the content of the paper, I will compile the identified datasets along with their full citations. If the authors refer to any datasets that are publicly available or widely recognized, I will ensure to include those citations as well.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will summarize the datasets in a clear format, ensuring that each dataset is accompanied by its full citation for proper documentation and future reference.
