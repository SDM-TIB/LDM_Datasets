To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Identification of Conversation Partners from Egocentric Video" by Tobias Dorszewski et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and dataset sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions a dataset comprising **69 hours of egocentric video** for identifying conversation partners, which indicates that a specific dataset is being introduced.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (The Dataset)**, where the authors provide detailed information about their dataset. They describe the dataset's characteristics, including the number of hours of video, the number of conversation clips, and the context in which the data was collected. This section is crucial as it outlines the dataset's purpose and structure.

The dataset is described as follows:
- **Egocentric Video Dataset**: This dataset consists of 69 hours of egocentric video collected from 48 subjects during conversations in various group sizes and settings. It includes 877 conversation clips, with an average length of 4.7 minutes per clip. The dataset is designed to facilitate the identification of conversation partners in multi-talker environments.

In addition to the egocentric video, the authors mention that **calibrated eye tracking data** was obtained for 74% of the clips, which adds another layer of information that can be useful for evaluating gaze estimation algorithms.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. The authors reference other datasets that are relevant to their work, including:

1. **EasyCom Dataset**:

2. **Ego4D Dataset**: 
   > Kristen Grauman et al. Ego4D: Around the World in 3,000 Hours of Egocentric Video. Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2022:18973–18990, 2022.

3. **SAAL Dataset**: 
   > Fiona Ryan et al. Egocentric Auditory Attention Localization in Conversations. Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 14663–14674, 2023.

These citations are important as they provide the necessary references for the datasets that the authors discuss in relation to their own work.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets relevant to the research conducted in this paper.
