To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Large Open Access Dataset of Brain Metastasis 3D Segmentations with Clinical and Imaging Feature Information" by Divya Ramakrishnan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant details, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the creation of a large, heterogeneous annotated brain metastasis dataset, which indicates that a dataset is indeed present. The introduction further emphasizes the need for large, diverse datasets to improve AI algorithms for brain metastasis diagnosis and treatment.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methods** or **data records** sections. In this paper, the authors describe their dataset in detail in the **data records** section. They mention that the dataset consists of 200 patients with various MRI sequences and 3D segmentations of brain metastases.

The dataset includes:
1. **MRI Images**: The dataset contains four standard MRI sequences (T1 pre-contrast, T1 post-contrast, T2, and FLAIR) for each patient.
2. **3D Segmentations**: It includes 3D segmentations of contrast-enhancing lesions, necrotic tumor portions, and whole tumors (including peritumoral edema).

The authors also state that the dataset will be made publicly available on The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA), which is crucial for accessibility.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The authors refer to two publicly available brain metastasis datasets, which are relevant for context but not the primary dataset they created. However, they do not provide specific citations for their own dataset since it is newly created and will be published.

For the existing datasets mentioned in the paper, I will note the following citations:
- For the dataset by Ocaña-Tienda et al.:
  > Ocaña-Tienda B, Pérez-Beteta J, Villanueva-García JD, et al. *A comprehensive dataset of annotated brain metastasis MR images with clinical and radiomic data*. Sci Data. 2023;10(1):208.

- For the BrainMetShare dataset:
  > BrainMetShare | Center for Artificial Intelligence in Medicine & Imaging. Accessed May 7, 2023. https://aimi.stanford.edu/brainmetshare

Since the authors are in the process of publishing their dataset, I will note that the full citation for their dataset will be available once it is officially published on TCIA.

In summary, I will compile the dataset information and citations into a structured format for further processing, ensuring that I have accurately captured all relevant details and citations.
