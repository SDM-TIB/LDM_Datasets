To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Translate Meanings, Not Just Words: IdiomKBâ€™s Role in Optimizing Idiomatic Translation with Language Models" by Shuang Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract introduces the concept of a multilingual idiom knowledge base (IDIOMKB) and hints at the use of various datasets for constructing this knowledge base.

Next, I will focus on the **section discussing IDIOMKB construction**. Here, the authors detail the source data collection process for constructing the idiom knowledge base. They mention several datasets from which idioms are sourced:

1. **MAGPIE**: A dataset containing potentially idiomatic expressions in context.
2. **IMIL**: A dataset that includes idiom translations in several Indian languages.
3. **EPIE**: A dataset that categorizes idioms based on lexical changes and includes their English meanings.
4. **PIE**: A dataset that provides parallel idiomatic and literal sentences.

The authors also mention datasets for Chinese and Japanese idioms:

- **PETCI**: A dataset that includes idiom English translations from dictionaries.
- **CCT**: A cloze test dataset that includes prevalent Chinese idioms.
- **ChID**: Another cloze-style dataset for Chinese idioms.
- **OpenMWE**: A dataset designed for idiom identification in Japanese.
- **ID10M**: A dataset that collects idioms from several languages.

In the **experiments section**, the authors discuss the application of IDIOMKB and how it improves idiomatic translation, which further confirms the datasets used in their methodology.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper from the **References section**:

- For **MAGPIE**, the citation is:

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations for further processing or review.
