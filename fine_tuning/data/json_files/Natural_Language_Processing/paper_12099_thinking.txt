To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Conformalization of Sparse Generalized Linear Models" by Etash Kumar Guha et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the research, which may include references to datasets used.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as this is typically where authors describe the datasets they used for their analyses. In this paper, the authors mention using four datasets to illustrate the performance of their algorithm. I will look for specific names and descriptions of these datasets.

Upon reviewing the experiments section, I find the following datasets mentioned:

1. **Diabetes Dataset**: A regression dataset with 20 features and 442 samples, sourced from the Scikit-learn library.
2. **Friedman1 Dataset**: A well-known regression dataset with 10 features and 100 samples, originally introduced by H. in 1991.
3. **Friedman2 Dataset**: Another regression dataset with 100 samples and 4 features, sourced from Breiman's work in 1996.
4. **Synthetic Datasets**: Two synthetic datasets generated for the experiments, one with 100 samples and 100 features, and another larger dataset with 1000 features and 20 samples.

Next, I will consult the **References section** to gather the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

- For the **Diabetes Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Pedregosa, F., Varoquaux, G., Gramfort, A., Michel, V., Thirion, B., Grisel, O., Blondel, M., Prettenhofer, P., Weiss, R., Dubourg, V., Vanderplas, J., Passos, A., Cournapeau, D., Brucher, M., Perrot, M., and Duchesnay, E. *Scikit-learn: Machine learning in Python*. Journal of Machine Learning Research, 12:2825–2830, 2011.

- For the **Friedman1 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > H., F. J. *Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines*. The Annals of Statistics, 1991.

- For the **Friedman2 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Breiman, L. *Bagging predictors*. Machine Learning, 24(2):123–140, 1996.

The synthetic datasets do not have specific citations as they were generated for the purpose of the experiments.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This structured approach allows me to accurately extract and document the datasets used in the research paper.
