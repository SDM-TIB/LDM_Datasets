To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Region-aware Distribution Contrast: A Novel Approach to Multi-Task Partially Supervised Learning" by Meixuan Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors conducted extensive experiments on two widely used benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they refer to two standard dense prediction multi-task datasets:

1. **NYU-V2 Dataset**: This dataset is described as an indoor dataset of natural scenes that includes three dense prediction tasks: semantic segmentation, depth estimation, and surface normal estimation. The authors mention that the semantic segmentation task contains 13 categories, and depth estimation is provided by Microsoft Kinect.

2. **Cityscapes Dataset**: This dataset is well-known for autonomous driving and consists of outdoor street scenes with two tasks: semantic segmentation and depth estimation. The authors note that they used 7-class semantic segmentation annotations for evaluation.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **NYU-V2 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Silberman, N., Hoiem, D., Kohli, P., & Fergus, R. (2012). *Indoor segmentation and support inference from RGBD images*. In Proceedings of the European Conference on Computer Vision (pp. 746–760). Springer.

- For **Cityscapes Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Cordts, M., Omran, M., Ramos, S., Rehfeld, T., Enzweiler, M., Benenson, R., Franke, U., Roth, S., & Schiele, B. (2016). *The Cityscapes dataset for semantic urban scene understanding*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (pp. 3213–3223).

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and full citation for each dataset. This will ensure that the extracted datasets are well-documented and ready for further use or analysis.
