To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CASE STUDIES ON X-RAY IMAGING, MRI AND NUCLEAR IMAGING" by Shuvra Sarker et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the text, ensuring to include full citations for each.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a general overview of the study, but I will focus on sections where datasets are likely to be detailed.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of medical imaging and mention various imaging modalities, but they do not specify datasets here. I will move on to the **materials and methodology section**, where datasets are more likely to be listed.

In **section 3.1 (X-ray)**, the authors mention two specific datasets used for COVID-19 detection from X-ray images:

1. **Cohen JP’s dataset (covid-chest x-ray-dataset)**: This dataset is frequently used for collecting X-ray images of COVID-19 patients and is updated periodically from various free sources.

2. **ChestX-ray8**: This dataset contains 108,948 anterior-view X-ray images of 32,717 distinct patients, annotated with eight illness descriptors to assist in detecting thoracic diseases.

Next, I will check the **MRI section (3.2)** for any datasets mentioned. The authors refer to several datasets used for brain tumor detection:

1. **BRATS (Brain Tumor Segmentation Challenge)**: A well-known dataset for brain tumor segmentation and classification.

2. **OASIS (Open Access Series of Imaging Studies)**: A dataset that provides MRI data for various studies.

3. **IBSR (Internet Brain Segmentation Repository)**: Another dataset used for brain imaging studies.

4. **Kaggle**: The authors mention that datasets from Kaggle are utilized, but they do not specify which ones.

5. **The Whole Brain Atlas (WBA)**: A dataset that includes various brain imaging studies.

In the **nuclear imaging section (3.3)**, the authors do not specify any datasets directly but mention that datasets were prepared by the Nuclear Diagnostic Department for diagnosing diseases from SPECT images.

Now, I will compile the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

- For **Cohen JP’s dataset**, the citation is:
  > ieee8023 IEEE8023/covid-chestxray-dataset: We are building an open database of COVID-19 cases with chest X-ray or CT images. In: GitHub. https://github.com/ieee8023/covid-chestxray-dataset. Accessed 30 Jan 2023.

- For **ChestX-ray8**, the citation is:

- For **BRATS**, the citation is:

- For **OASIS**, the citation is:
  > OASIS Brains. In: OASIS Brains - Open Access Series of Imaging Studies. https://www.oasis-brains.org/. Accessed 30 Jan 2023.

- For **IBSR**, the citation is:
  > NITRC: IBSR: Tool/Resource Info. In: N I T R C. https://www.nitrc.org/projects/ibsr. Accessed 30 Jan 2023.

- For **Kaggle**, the citation is:
  > Find open datasets and Machine Learning Projects. In: Kaggle. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets. Accessed 30 Jan 2023.

- For **The Whole Brain Atlas (WBA)**, the citation is:
  > The Whole Brain Atlas. In: The Whole Brain Atlas. https://portal.brain-map.org/explor/overview. Accessed 30 Jan 2023.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for further processing or review.
