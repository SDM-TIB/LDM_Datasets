To extract datasets from the research paper titled "How more data can hurt: Instability and regularization in next-generation reservoir computing" by Yuanzhao Zhang and Sean P. Cornelius, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, results, and discussion sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any references to datasets or data sources used in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **results section**, as it often contains detailed descriptions of the datasets used for experiments. I will look for any specific datasets mentioned, including their names, characteristics, and how they were utilized in the study.

In this paper, the authors discuss the use of **next-generation reservoir computing (NGRC)** and its application to a classical nonlinear system, the **magnetic pendulum**. However, they do not explicitly mention any publicly available datasets in the text. Instead, they describe the experimental setup and the nature of the data generated for their experiments.

Since the paper does not provide specific dataset names or citations, I will need to look for any references to datasets in the **References section**. I will check if any cited works describe datasets that could be relevant to the experiments conducted in this study.

After reviewing the references, I will compile the information about any datasets identified, including their full citations. If no specific datasets are mentioned, I will note that the authors generated their own data for the experiments and provide a summary of the experimental setup instead.

Finally, I will ensure that I have accurately captured the necessary details for each dataset, including the citation format, and prepare to present this information in a structured manner.
