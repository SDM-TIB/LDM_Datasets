To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DeMamba: AI-Generated Video Detection on Million-Scale Benchmark" by Haoxing Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract introduces the **GenVideo** dataset, which is described as the first AI-generated video detection dataset, indicating that this is a primary dataset of interest.

Next, I will examine **section 3 (GenVideo)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset. Here, they mention that **GenVideo** contains 1,078,838 AI-generated videos and 1,223,511 real videos. The real videos are sourced from existing datasets, specifically:

1. **Youku-mPLUG Dataset**: This dataset is referenced as a source of real videos.
2. **Kinetics-400 Dataset**: Another source for real videos, which is widely recognized in the field.
3. **MSR-VTT Dataset**: This dataset is also mentioned as a source for real videos.

In **section 3.3**, the authors elaborate on how the real videos were collected, confirming the datasets used for sourcing real video content.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

- For the **Youku-mPLUG Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Haiyang Xu, Qinghao Ye, Xuan Wu, Ming Yan, Yuan Miao, Jiabo Ye, Guohai Xu, Anwen Hu, Yaya Shi, Guangwei Xu, et al. *Youku-mPLUG: A 10 million large-scale Chinese video-language dataset for pre-training and benchmarks*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2306.04362, 2023.

- For the **Kinetics-400 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Will Kay, João Carreira, Karen Simonyan, Brian Zhang, Chloe Hillier, Sudheendra Vijayanarasimhan, Fabio Viola, Tim Green, Trevor Back, Paul Natsev, Mustafa Suleyman, and Andrew Zisserman. *The Kinetics human action video dataset*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1705.06950, 2017.

- For the **MSR-VTT Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Jun Xu, Tao Mei, Ting Yao, and Yong Rui. *MSR-VTT: A large video description dataset for bridging video and language*. In CVPR, pages 5288–5296, 2016.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets referenced in the paper, ready for further processing or review.
