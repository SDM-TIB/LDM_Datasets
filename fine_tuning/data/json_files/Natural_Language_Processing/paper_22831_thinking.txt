To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Survey on Vision-Language-Action Models for Embodied AI" by Yueen Ma et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections of the paper. These sections often provide a high-level overview of the research and may mention key datasets used in the study. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or references to experiments that involve datasets.

Next, I will examine **section IV (Datasets, Simulators, and Benchmarks)**, as this section is likely dedicated to discussing the datasets used in the research. I will carefully read through this section to identify any datasets that are listed, along with their descriptions, types, and any relevant details about their usage in the context of the paper.

In this section, I will specifically look for tables or lists that summarize the datasets, as they often provide concise information about each dataset, including its name, type, and the tasks it is associated with. For example, I will note any datasets mentioned in Table V, which summarizes robot datasets collected by recent VLAs.

Once I have identified the datasets, I will then refer to the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial as it provides the necessary bibliographic information for proper attribution. I will ensure to capture the authors, title, publication venue, and year for each dataset.

For instance, if I find a dataset like "RoboNet," I will look for its citation in the references, which might look something like this:
> S. Dasari et al., "RoboNet: Large-scale multi-robot learning," in Proceedings of the 3rd Annual Conference on Robot Learning, CoRL 2019, Osaka, Japan, 2019.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the datasets into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset entry includes its name, description, type, and full citation.

Finally, I will double-check my entries for accuracy and completeness before finalizing the dataset extraction process. This systematic approach will help ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations from the paper effectively.
