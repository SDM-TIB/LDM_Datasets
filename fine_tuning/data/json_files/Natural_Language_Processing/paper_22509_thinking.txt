To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fair Graph Representation Learning via Sensitive Attribute Disentanglement" by Yuchang Zhu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for experiments. The introduction typically elaborates on the context and significance of the research, which may include references to specific datasets.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors discuss the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they explicitly list the datasets and provide details about each one. The paper mentions five datasets: **German**, **Bail**, **Credit**, **Pokec-z**, and **Pokec-n**. I will extract the relevant information about each dataset, including the number of nodes, edges, attributes, and the sensitive attribute associated with each dataset.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

Here are the datasets I will extract:

1. **German Dataset**: 
   - Description: Contains clientsâ€™ data from a German bank, focusing on credit risk classification.
   - Citation: 
     > D. Asuncion and D. Newman. 2007. UCI machine learning repository.

2. **Bail Dataset**: 
   - Description: Includes data on defendants released on bail in the U.S., used for predicting recidivism.
   - Citation: 
     > Yushun Dong et al. 2022. Edits: Modeling and mitigating data bias for graph neural networks. In Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2022.

3. **Credit Dataset**: 
   - Description: Represents credit card users and their payment patterns, used for predicting defaults.
   - Citation: 
     > I-Cheng Yeh and Che-hui Lien. 2009. The comparisons of data mining techniques for the predictive accuracy of probability of default of credit card clients. Expert systems with applications.

4. **Pokec-z Dataset**: 
   - Description: Social network data from Slovakia, focusing on user demographics and interests.
   - Citation: 
     > Lubos Takac and Michal Zabovsky. 2012. Data analysis in public social networks. In International scientific conference and international workshop present day trends of innovations.

5. **Pokec-n Dataset**: 
   - Description: Similar to Pokec-z, but from a different province in Slovakia.
   - Citation: 
     > Lubos Takac and Michal Zabovsky. 2012. Data analysis in public social networks. In International scientific conference and international workshop present day trends of innovations.

Finally, I will compile the extracted dataset information along with their citations into a structured format for clarity and ease of use in future references or applications.
