To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Quantifying Language Models’ Sensitivity to Spurious Features in Prompt Design" by Yejin Choi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of language models and mentions "a suite of analyses," which suggests that datasets may be involved, but I need to confirm this in the main body of the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental setup section** (Section 4.1) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, I will look for specific names of datasets, their characteristics, and any relevant details about how they were used in the experiments.

Upon reviewing Section 4.1, I find that the authors mention using a subset of **53 tasks from Super-NaturalInstructions**. This dataset is described as containing diverse human-written formats and instructions, which is crucial for understanding the context of their experiments.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Super-NaturalInstructions dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Yao Lu, Max Bartolo, Alastair Moore, Sebastian Riedel, and Pontus Stenetorp. *Fantastically ordered prompts and where to find them: Overcoming few-shot prompt order sensitivity*. In Proceedings of the 2022 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 8086–8098, 2022.

Additionally, I will look for any other datasets mentioned throughout the paper, especially in the sections discussing results or analyses. If the authors refer to any other datasets, I will document those as well, ensuring to capture their full citations.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, into a structured format for easy reference.

In summary, my steps will be:
1. Read the abstract, introduction, and methodology sections for mentions of datasets.
2. Focus on Section 4.1 for detailed descriptions of datasets used in experiments.
3. Retrieve full citations from the References section for any identified datasets.
4. Document all findings systematically for clarity and completeness.
