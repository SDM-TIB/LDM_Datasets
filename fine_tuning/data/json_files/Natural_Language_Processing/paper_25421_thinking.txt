To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Conversational Query Reformulation with the Guidance of Retrieved Documents" by Jeonghyun Park and Hwanhee Lee, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. In **section 4.1 (Datasets and Metrics)**, the authors mention three specific datasets:

1. **TREC CAsT-19**: This dataset consists of 50 conversations and 479 questions, with a document collection of 38 million documents. It is designed for conversational information seeking.

2. **TREC CAsT-20**: This dataset is similar to CAsT-19 but consists of 25 conversations and 216 questions, also with a document collection of 38 million documents. It is noted for being more realistic and complex.

3. **QReCC Dataset**: This dataset includes a training set and a test set, with approximately 54 million documents. It is specifically designed for open-domain question answering in a conversational context.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **TREC CAsT-19**, the citation is:
  > Jeffrey Dalton, Chenyan Xiong, and Jamie Callan. *Cast-19: A dataset for conversational information seeking*. In Proceedings of the 43rd International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval, pages 1985–1988, 2020.

- For **TREC CAsT-20**, the citation is:
  > Jeffrey Dalton, Chenyan Xiong, and Jamie Callan. *Cast 2020: The conversational assistance track overview*. In Proceedings of the 2021 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, pages 520–534, 2021.

- For **QReCC Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Raviteja Anantha, Svitlana Vakulenko, Zhucheng Tu, Shayne Longpre, Stephen Pulman, and Srinivas Chappidi. *Open-domain question answering goes conversational via question rewriting*. In Proceedings of the 2021 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, pages 520–534, 2021.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations into a structured format for further processing. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their sources as required.
