To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Provable Accelerated Convergence of Nesterovâ€™s Momentum for Deep ReLU Neural Networks" by Fangshuo Liao and Anastasios Kyrillidis, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction typically outlines the context and significance of the work, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will look for specific sections that discuss experiments or evaluations, such as **section 4 (Realization of Assumption 1-6)**, where the authors might describe the datasets used for their experiments. I will pay close attention to any mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

In this paper, the authors mention two realizations of the problem class: an **additive model** and **deep ReLU networks**. I will check if they provide any datasets related to these models. If they do, I will note down the details.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily.

For example, if the authors mention a dataset like the **CIFAR-10 dataset**, I would look for its citation, which typically includes the authors, title, conference or journal name, year, and any relevant page numbers.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that I maintain clarity and accuracy in the representation of each dataset.

Finally, I will summarize the findings in a structured format, ready for further processing or review.
