To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Part-Guided 3D RL for Sim2Real Articulated Object Manipulation" by Pengwei Xie et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to gather initial insights about any datasets referenced. The abstract mentions a novel framework for manipulating articulated objects, which suggests that datasets may be involved, especially for training and evaluation purposes.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this paper, the authors mention that they conducted experiments on three articulated object manipulation tasks and refer to the **Partnet Mobility dataset** as a source for synthetic data generation. This indicates that there is at least one dataset to document.

In the **experimental setup section**, the authors specify that they collected synthetic data from various categories of articulated objects, including doors, drawers, and faucets. They mention using the **Partnet Mobility dataset** to collect synthetic data, which is crucial for understanding the context of their experiments.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the **Partnet Mobility dataset**. The citation is as follows:
> Mo, K., Guibas, L. J., Mukadam, M., Gupta, A., et al. "Where2act: From pixels to actions for articulated 3D objects." In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2021, pp. 6813–6823.

Additionally, the authors mention using **SUNRGBD** and **SceneNetRGBD** datasets for background variations during data generation. I will also retrieve their citations from the references section:

- For **SUNRGBD**:
> Song, S., Lichtenberg, S. P., & Xiao, J. "SUN RGB-D: A RGB-D Scene Understanding Benchmark Suite." In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2015, pp. 567–576.

- For **SceneNetRGBD**:
> McCormac, J., Handa, A., Leutenegger, S., & Davison, A. J. "SceneNet RGB-D: Can 5M Synthetic Images Beat Generic ImageNet Pre-Training on Indoor Segmentation?" In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2017, pp. 2678–2687.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and that the full citations are included for reference. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
