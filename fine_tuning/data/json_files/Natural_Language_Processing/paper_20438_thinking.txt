To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Two-sided Acoustic Metascreen for Broadband and Individual Reflection and Transmission Control" by Ao Chen and Xin Zhang, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, results, and methods sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study and may mention any datasets used for validation or experimentation. The introduction often discusses the context and significance of the research, which might include references to existing datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **results section**, as this is where the authors typically describe the experiments conducted and the datasets utilized. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, characteristics, and how they were used in the experiments.

In this paper, the authors do not explicitly mention any datasets in the results section. However, they describe the experimental setup and the methodologies used, which may imply the use of standard datasets or experimental conditions. I will also check the **methods section** for any references to datasets or data collection methods that could indicate the datasets used.

After gathering information from these sections, I will consult the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. If the authors refer to established datasets, I will ensure to include the original sources for those datasets.

Since the paper does not specify any datasets directly, I will note that the authors conducted experiments using their proposed two-sided acoustic metascreen design, but no external datasets were cited. Therefore, I will summarize the findings without specific dataset citations.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include any relevant details about the datasets, even if they are not explicitly named in the paper. If no datasets are found, I will document that as well.

In conclusion, I will ensure that I have thoroughly reviewed the paper for any datasets, their descriptions, and citations, and I will present my findings clearly and accurately.
