To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Analysis of Seismocardiographic Signals Using Polynomial Chirplet Transform and Smoothed Pseudo Wigner-Ville Distribution" by Amirtaha Taebi and Hansen A. Mansy, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, results, and conclusion sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any references to datasets or data sources.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, where the authors describe the data acquisition process. Here, they mention that actual SCG signals from **8 healthy subjects** were analyzed. This indicates that there is a dataset related to these SCG signals.

In the **results section**, the authors present findings based on the analysis of these SCG signals, which further confirms the existence of a dataset. They also mention the use of **synthetic test signals** for evaluating the accuracy of different time-frequency distribution methods. I will need to clarify if these synthetic signals are part of a dataset or if they were generated for the study.

I will also check the **acknowledgments and references sections** for any citations related to the datasets used. The acknowledgment mentions support from NIH R44HL099053, which may relate to the funding for the dataset acquisition.

Now, I will compile the information I have gathered:

1. **SCG Signals Dataset**: This dataset consists of actual seismocardiographic signals collected from 8 healthy subjects. The authors used a lightweight accelerometer to measure these signals, which were digitized and processed.

2. **Synthetic Test Signals**: The authors generated synthetic SCG signals with known time-frequency properties for evaluating the accuracy of the TFD methods. While these are not traditional datasets, they are important for the study's methodology.

Next, I will look for full citations for these datasets. The SCG signals dataset does not have a specific citation since it is original data collected by the authors. However, I will note the methodology used for data acquisition:

- For the SCG signals, the authors used:
  > Taebi, A., & Mansy, H. A. (Year). *Analysis of Seismocardiographic Signals Using Polynomial Chirplet Transform and Smoothed Pseudo Wigner-Ville Distribution*. Biomedical Acoustics Research Laboratory, University of Central Florida.

- For the synthetic signals, since they are generated by the authors, I will note:
  > Taebi, A., & Mansy, H. A. (Year). *Synthetic Test Signals for Time-Frequency Analysis*. Biomedical Acoustics Research Laboratory, University of Central Florida.

Finally, I will summarize the datasets and their citations in a structured format for clarity and future reference.
