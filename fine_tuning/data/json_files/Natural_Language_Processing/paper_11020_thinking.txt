To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Edge-guided Representation Learning for Underwater Object Detection" by Linhui Dai et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on three challenging underwater datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically the subsection labeled **IV. A. Datasets**. Here, the authors explicitly list the datasets used in their experiments:

1. **UTDAC2020**: This dataset is described as part of the Underwater Target Detection Algorithm Competition 2020, containing 5,168 training images and 1,293 validation images across four classes: echinus, holothurian, starfish, and scallop. The images have various resolutions.

2. **Brackish Dataset**: This dataset is noted as the first annotated underwater image dataset captured in temperate brackish waters, containing 14,518 frames with 25,613 annotations across six classes: bigfish, crab, jellyfish, shrimp, small fish, and starfish. The dataset is split into training, validation, and test sets.

3. **TrashCan Dataset**: This dataset is sourced from the J-EDI deep-sea image electronic library and includes 1,000 video data of varying lengths. It is labeled with two versions, and the authors used the TrashCan-Material version, which contains 6,008 training images and 1,204 validation images across 16 object categories.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

- For **UTDAC2020**, the citation is:
  > Flyai. *Underwater Object Detection Dataset*. https://www.flyai.com/d/underwaterdetection, accessed November 4, 2020.

- For **Brackish Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Pedersen, M., Bruslund Haurum, J., Gade, R., & Moeslund, T. B. (2019). *Detection of marine animals in a new underwater dataset with varying visibility*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops (pp. 18â€“26).

- For **TrashCan Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Hong, J., Fulton, M., & Sattar, J. (2020). *TrashCan: A semantically-segmented dataset towards visual detection of marine debris*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2007.08097.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented and properly cited.
