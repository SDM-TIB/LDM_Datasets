To extract datasets from the research paper titled "BEYOND ACCURACY-FAIRNESS: STOP EVALUATING BIAS MITIGATION METHODS SOLELY ON BETWEEN-GROUP METRICS" by Sofie Goethals et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a general overview, but the materials section is likely to contain specific dataset names and descriptions.

In the **materials section (3.1)**, the authors list several datasets used in their study:

1. **Adult Income Dataset**: This dataset contains information extracted from the 1994 census data, with the target variable indicating whether a person's income exceeds $50,000 a year.

2. **Compas Dataset**: This dataset includes demographic information and criminal histories of defendants from Broward County, used to predict whether a defendant will re-offend within two years.

3. **Dutch Census Dataset**: This dataset represents aggregated groups of people in the Netherlands for the year 2001 and can be used to predict whether a person's occupation can be categorized as high-level (prestigious) or low-level.

4. **Law Admission Dataset**: This dataset is based on a survey conducted across 163 law schools in the United States in 1991, predicting whether a student will pass the bar exam.

5. **Student Performance Dataset**: This dataset describes the achievements of students in two Portuguese schools, with the classification task being to predict whether they score above average in mathematics.

Next, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

- For the **Adult Income Dataset**, the citation is:
  > D. J. Hand, et al. *Measuring classifier performance: a coherent alternative to the area under the roc curve*. Machine learning, 77(1):103–123, 2009.

- For the **Compas Dataset**, the citation is:
  > ProPublica. *Machine Bias*. 2016. [Link to the dataset].

- For the **Dutch Census Dataset**, the citation is:
  > P. Van der Laan. *The 2001 census in the Netherlands*. In Conference the Census of Population, 2000.

- For the **Law Admission Dataset**, the citation is:
  > L. F. Wightman. *LSAC National Longitudinal Bar Passage Study*. LSAC research report series, 1998.

- For the **Student Performance Dataset**, the citation is:
  > P. Cortez and A. M. G. Silva. *Using data mining to predict secondary school student performance*. EUROSIS-ETI, pages 5–12, 2008.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that all datasets are accurately represented and properly cited, which is essential for academic integrity and reproducibility in research.
