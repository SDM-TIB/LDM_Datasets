To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Physically Consistent Modelling of Wireless Links with Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces Using Multiport Network Analysis" by Josef A. Nossek et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, but I will need to delve deeper into the body of the paper for specific dataset information.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the context and significance of reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) in wireless communication, but they do not mention any datasets directly. I will continue to the methodology and results sections for more detailed information.

Next, I will examine the **numerical results section** (Section III), where the authors present simulations and experiments. Here, they describe scenarios involving single and multiple RIS elements, but they do not explicitly mention any datasets used for these simulations. Instead, they focus on theoretical models and numerical results derived from their analysis.

Since there are no datasets explicitly mentioned in the paper, I will check the **references section** to see if any datasets are cited indirectly through the referenced works. The references include several papers that may contain datasets relevant to the study of RISs, but I need to verify if they are indeed datasets.

Upon reviewing the references, I find that some of the cited works may have associated datasets, but the paper itself does not provide specific datasets used in the experiments or simulations. Therefore, I will note that while the paper discusses theoretical models and numerical results, it does not provide any datasets for direct citation.

In conclusion, I will summarize my findings as follows:

- The paper does not explicitly mention any datasets used for the research.
- The authors focus on theoretical modeling and numerical results rather than empirical data.
- Relevant datasets may be found in the cited references, but they are not directly provided in this paper.

Since no datasets are available for extraction, I will not create any dataset entries or citations. Instead, I will document the absence of datasets in my final output.
