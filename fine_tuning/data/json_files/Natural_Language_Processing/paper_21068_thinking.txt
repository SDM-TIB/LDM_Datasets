To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Decentralized Collaborative Learning Framework with External Privacy Leakage Analysis" by Tsuyoshi Id√©, Dzung T. Phan, and Rudy Raymond, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions, but it may not specify datasets. The introduction often discusses the context and relevance of the research, which might include references to datasets used in prior work or in the current study.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly any subsections that explicitly mention datasets. In this paper, the authors discuss a collaborative learning framework and may reference datasets used for training or evaluation. I will look for any specific names or descriptions of datasets.

If the paper includes a **results or experiments section**, I will examine it closely, as this is where datasets are typically detailed in terms of their characteristics, size, and how they were utilized in the experiments. 

After identifying any datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. This is crucial, as I need to provide complete citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. I will ensure that I capture all necessary details, such as authors, title, publication venue, and year.

For instance, if the paper mentions a dataset like "Penn Action Dataset," I would look for its citation in the references. If it is not directly cited, I may need to search for the original source of the dataset to provide an accurate citation.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, I will compile the details, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will include the dataset name, a brief description, and the citation formatted correctly.

Finally, I will organize this information in a structured manner, ready for presentation or further processing, ensuring that all dataset citations are complete and accurate.
