To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Let’s Go Shopping (LGS) – Web-Scale Image-Text Dataset for Visual Concept Understanding" by Yatong Bai et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract introduces the **Let’s Go Shopping (LGS)** dataset, which consists of 15 million image-caption pairs collected from e-commerce websites. This indicates that the LGS dataset is a primary focus of the paper.

Next, I will examine the **section 3 (The Let’s Go Shopping (LGS) Dataset)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset. Here, I will find specific characteristics, such as the number of instances (14,847,764 image-text pairs) and the nature of the data (e-commerce focused, with clear backgrounds and descriptive captions).

In addition to LGS, I will look for any other datasets mentioned throughout the paper, particularly in the **related work** and **experiments** sections. The authors reference several other datasets, including:

1. **ImageNet**: A well-known dataset used for image classification tasks.
2. **COCO (Common Objects in Context)**: Another popular dataset for image captioning and object detection.
3. **Fashion MNIST**: A dataset for benchmarking machine learning algorithms in the fashion domain.
4. **Clothing1M**: A dataset that includes noisy labels for clothing items.

I will also check the **References section** to gather full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with sources for further exploration.

The full citations I will extract are:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that highlights each dataset's name, description, and citation. This will ensure that the datasets are clearly documented and easily accessible for future reference or use in research.
