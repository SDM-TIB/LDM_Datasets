To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Knowledge-Guided Additive Modeling For Supervised Regression" by Yann Claes et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a general overview of the research focus, but I will need to look deeper into the body of the paper for specific datasets.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the context of their research and may reference datasets used in previous studies. I will look for any mentions of datasets or references to standard regression problems that might indicate the datasets used.

Next, I will examine the **methods section**, particularly any subsections that discuss experiments or datasets. This section often contains detailed descriptions of the datasets used for training and testing the models. I will look for specific names of datasets, their characteristics, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

In the **experiments section**, the authors typically provide a summary of the datasets used for their experiments. I will pay close attention to any tables or figures that summarize the datasets, as they often contain crucial information such as dataset names, sizes, and relevant features.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is critical for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

From my reading, I have identified the following datasets:

1. **Combined Cycle Power Plant (CCPP) Dataset**: This dataset contains 9,568 measurements of net hourly electrical energy output for a combined cycle power plant, along with four hourly average input variables.
   - Citation: Tfekci, P., Kaya, H. (2014). *Combined Cycle Power Plant*. UCI Machine Learning Repository. DOI: https://doi.org/10.24432/C5002N.

2. **Concrete Compressive Strength (CCS) Dataset**: This dataset consists of 1,030 samples relating amounts of concrete components with the resulting compressive strength.
   - Citation: Yeh, I.C. (2007). *Concrete Compressive Strength*. UCI Machine Learning Repository. DOI: https://doi.org/10.24432/C5PK67.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
