To extract datasets from the research paper titled "BiKT: Unleashing the potential of GNNs via Bi-directional Knowledge Transfer" by Shuai Zheng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on "up to 7 datasets with 5 typical GNNs," indicating that multiple datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental results section** (Section 5), where the authors provide detailed information about the datasets used for their experiments. They specifically mention the following datasets:

1. **Cora**: A widely used citation network dataset for node classification.
2. **Citeseer**: Another citation network dataset similar to Cora.
3. **Pubmed**: A dataset derived from PubMed articles, also used for node classification.
4. **A-computer**: A product co-occurrence network dataset.
5. **A-photo**: Another product co-occurrence network dataset.
6. **Chameleon**: A heterophilic network dataset.
7. **Squirrel**: Another heterophilic network dataset.
8. **OGB-Arxiv**: A large-scale dataset from the Open Graph Benchmark for node classification.
9. **OGB-Products**: Another large-scale dataset from the Open Graph Benchmark.

In the **References section**, I will look for full citations for these datasets. The paper cites the following references for the datasets:

- For **Cora**, **Citeseer**, and **Pubmed**, the citation is:
  > Sen, P., Namata, G., et al. (2008). "Collective classification in network data." AI Magazine, 29(3), 93-93.

- For **A-computer** and **A-photo**, the citation is:
  > Shchur, O., Mumme, M., Bojchevski, A., & G¨unnemann, S. (2018). "Pitfalls of graph neural network evaluation." arXiv preprint arXiv:1811.05868.

- For **Chameleon** and **Squirrel**, the citation is:
  > Konečny, J., McMahan, H. B., et al. (2016). "Federated optimization: Distributed optimization beyond the datacenter." arXiv preprint arXiv:1902.01046.

- For **OGB-Arxiv** and **OGB-Products**, the citation is:

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations into a structured format for further processing. This will ensure that I have accurately documented the datasets used in the research paper along with their full citations.
