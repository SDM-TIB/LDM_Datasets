To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning joint and individual structure in network data with covariates" by Carson James et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** sections to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the application of the methodology to a food trade network, which suggests that there may be a dataset related to this network.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors describe their application to a food trade network and mention using economic, developmental, and geographical indicators as covariates. This indicates that there are at least two datasets involved: one for the network and one for the covariates.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find the following datasets:

1. **Food Trade Network Dataset**: This dataset represents the total food trade from one country to another for various food products during a specific year (2010). The authors mention that the data was collected by De Domenico et al. (2015).

2. **Country-Level Economic and Development Indicators Dataset**: This dataset includes economic and developmental indicators from the World Bank open data database, which could explain variations in the trade data. The authors reference the work of Piburn (2020) for this dataset.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the **References section** of the paper:

- For the **Food Trade Network Dataset**, the citation is:
  > De Domenico, M., Nicosia, V., Arenas, A., & Latora, V. (2015). Structural reducibility of multilayer networks. *Nature Communications*, 6(1), 6864.

- For the **Country-Level Economic and Development Indicators Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Piburn, J. (2020). wbstats: Programmatic Access to the World Bank API. Oak Ridge, Tennessee: Oak Ridge National Laboratory.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly identifies each dataset along with its citation. This will ensure that the datasets are accurately represented and can be referenced appropriately in future work.
