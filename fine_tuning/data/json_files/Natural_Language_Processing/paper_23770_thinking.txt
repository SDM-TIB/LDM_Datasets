To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "LISD: An Efficient Multi-Task Learning Framework for Lidar Segmentation and Detection" by Jiahua Xu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the proposed method is evaluated on the **nuScenes dataset** and **Waymo Open Dataset**, which suggests that these datasets are crucial for the research.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (specifically section 3) where the authors describe the datasets used. Here, they explicitly mention:

1. **nuScenes Dataset**: This dataset includes 1000 scenarios captured using a 32-beam lidar sensor, with point-wise semantic labels for 16 categories and bounding box annotations for object detection.

2. **Waymo Open Dataset (WOD)**: This dataset contains 2000 scenarios captured by a 64-beam lidar sensor, with semantic labels for 23 classes and bounding box annotations for 3 categories.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations provided in the paper are:

- For the **nuScenes dataset**:

"nuScenes: A multi-modal dataset for autonomous driving." In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2020, pp. 11621–11631.

- For the **Waymo Open Dataset**:
  > Pei Sun, Henrik Kretzschmar, Xerxes Dotiwalla, Aurelien Chouard, Vijaysai Patnaik, Paul Tsui, James Guo, Yin Zhou, Yuning Chai, Benjamin Caine, et al. "Scalability in perception for autonomous driving: Waymo Open Dataset." In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2020, pp. 2446–2454.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their full citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their respective citations.
