To extract datasets from the research paper titled "No Length Left Behind: Enhancing Knowledge Tracing for Modeling Sequences of Excessive or Insufficient Lengths" by Moyu Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for evaluation. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets in relation to the research problem.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, the authors explicitly mention three datasets: **ASSIST2009, ASSIST2012, and Algebra2005**. I will take note of the details provided for each dataset, including the number of samples, students, questions, and concepts.

The paper provides the following details about the datasets:

1. **ASSIST2009**: This dataset contains 282,668 samples, 3,883 students, 17,737 questions, and 109 concepts. It is sourced from the ASSISTments platform.

2. **ASSIST2012**: This dataset has 2,710,820 records, 28,325 students, and each question is related to one knowledge concept.

3. **Algebra2005**: This dataset includes 606,359 observed responses from 567 students and 172,994 questions, with each question related to one to seven knowledge concepts.

Now, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and further exploration of the datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **ASSIST2009**, the citation is:
  > Feng, M., Heffernan, N. T., & Koedinger, K. R. (2009). Addressing the assessment challenge with an online system that tutors as it assesses. *User Modeling and User-Adapted Interaction*, 19(3), 243-266.

- For **ASSIST2012**, the citation is:
  > Feng, M., Heffernan, N. T., & Koedinger, K. R. (2012). The ASSISTments platform: A tool for educational data mining. *User Modeling and User-Adapted Interaction*, 22(4), 335-364.

- For **Algebra2005**, the citation is:
  > Stamper, J., Niculescu-Mizil, A., Ritter, S., Gordon, G., & Koedinger, K. (2010). Algebra I 2005-2006 and Bridge to Algebra 2006-2007. Development data sets from KDD Cup 2010 Educational Data Mining Challenge. Retrieved from http://pslcdatashop.web.cmu.edu/KDDCup/downloads.jsp

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This structured approach will help in creating a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
