To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Modelling Uncertain Volatility Using Quantum Stochastic Calculus: Unitary vs Non-Unitary Time Evolution" by Will Hicks, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly referenced. The abstract discusses Monte-Carlo simulations but does not mention specific datasets. I will need to look deeper into the methodology and results sections for any datasets used in the simulations.

Next, I will examine **section 4 (Unitary Evolution: Monte-Carlo Simulation)**, where the author describes running a Monte-Carlo simulation with 1 million paths and various volatility parameters. However, it does not specify a dataset but rather describes the simulation setup. I will continue to look for any references to actual datasets used for validation or comparison.

In **section 6 (Modelling with Uncertain Volatility Case II)**, the author discusses a Monte-Carlo simulation with 100,000 paths and various time-steps, but again, there is no mention of a specific dataset. The focus is on the simulation process rather than on empirical datasets.

Finally, I will check the **References section** to see if any datasets are cited indirectly through the works referenced. The references include various papers on quantum stochastic calculus and financial modeling, but they do not appear to provide specific datasets.

After reviewing the entire paper, it seems that there are no explicit datasets mentioned that can be extracted with full citations. The paper primarily discusses theoretical models and simulation results rather than empirical datasets.

In conclusion, I will document that no specific datasets were found in the paper, and I will note the focus on theoretical modeling and simulation rather than on empirical data collection. If any datasets were mentioned, I would ensure to provide full citations for each, but in this case, there are none to report.
