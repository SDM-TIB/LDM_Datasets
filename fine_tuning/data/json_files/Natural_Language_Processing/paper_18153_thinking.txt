To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Source-Free and Image-Only Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for Category Level Object Pose Estimation" by Prakhar Kaushik et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and it may mention key datasets used for evaluation. 

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of 3D pose estimation and may reference datasets that have been previously used in related works. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or benchmarks.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly where the authors describe their evaluation setup. This section often contains detailed information about the datasets used, including their names, sizes, and characteristics. 

From the text, I note that the authors mention evaluating their model on the **OOD-CV** dataset and the **Corrupted-Pascal3D+** dataset. I will extract details about these datasets:

1. **OOD-CV Dataset**: This dataset is referenced as a benchmark for evaluating robustness in out-of-distribution scenarios. It includes various categories and nuisances, but I need to confirm the specific details from the text.

2. **Corrupted-Pascal3D+ Dataset**: This dataset is mentioned as containing objects from 12 man-made categories, annotated with 3D pose, 2D centroid, and object distance. I will ensure to capture the specifics of this dataset as well.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. This is crucial for proper attribution. The citations for the datasets are likely to be found in the references of the papers that introduced them.

For the **OOD-CV dataset**, I will look for the citation:
- Zhao, B., Wang, J., Ma, W., Jesslen, A., Yang, S., Yu, S., Theobalt, C., Yuille, A., & Kortylewski, A. (2023). OOD-CV: An extended benchmark for robustness to out-of-distribution shifts of individual nuisances in natural images.

For the **Corrupted-Pascal3D+ dataset**, I will find the citation:
- Xiang, Y., Mottaghi, R., & Savarese, S. (2014). Beyond Pascal: A benchmark for 3D object detection in the wild. In IEEE Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that I maintain clarity and accuracy in the details provided. This structured approach will help in effectively extracting and documenting the datasets used in the research paper.
