To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Distribution-Independent Regression for Generalized Linear Models with Oblivious Corruptions" by Ilias Diakonikolas et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a high-level overview, but the introduction often contains more detailed references to datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (if available) or any section that discusses the methodology in detail. This is typically where authors describe the datasets they used for their experiments. I will look for specific names of datasets, descriptions of their contents, and any relevant statistics (e.g., number of samples, features, etc.).

If the paper includes a **datasets section**, I will examine it closely, as it will likely contain the most comprehensive information about the datasets used. I will note down the names of the datasets, their purposes, and any relevant details provided by the authors.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets easily. I will ensure that I capture the authors, title, publication venue, and year for each dataset.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like "Penn Action Dataset," I will look for its citation in the references. If it is not directly cited, I will search for the original paper that introduced the dataset to provide an accurate citation.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each entry is clear and informative.

Finally, I will format the extracted information in a structured manner, ready for further processing or review.
