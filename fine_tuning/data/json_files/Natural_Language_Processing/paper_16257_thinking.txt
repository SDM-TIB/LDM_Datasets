To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A study on Satellite-to-Ground Propagation in Urban Environment" by N. Cenni et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, results, and conclusion sections** to look for any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on satellite-to-ground propagation, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any mentions of datasets or data sources. The introduction discusses the importance of characterizing the satellite-to-ground channel but does not specify any datasets used in the research.

Moving on to the **methodology section**, I will look for any details about simulations or data collection methods. The authors mention using a 3D ray-tracing simulator to analyze propagation mechanisms, but they do not refer to any specific datasets. Instead, they describe the parameters and settings for their simulations.

In the **results section**, I will check for any data presented in tables or figures that might indicate the use of datasets. The authors discuss the K-factor and various propagation mechanisms, but again, there are no explicit datasets mentioned.

Finally, I will review the **references section** to see if any cited works include datasets. The references primarily consist of studies and reports related to radio propagation and modeling, but they do not appear to reference specific datasets.

After thoroughly reviewing the paper, it seems that the authors did not utilize any publicly available datasets or specific data collections for their analysis. Instead, their work is based on simulations and theoretical models.

Since no datasets were identified in the paper, I will not be able to provide full citations for datasets as there are none to report. I will summarize my findings and conclude that the research relies on simulation data rather than external datasets.
