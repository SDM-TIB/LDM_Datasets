To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Modeling the Label Distributions for Weakly-Supervised Semantic Segmentation" by Linshan Wu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments on several datasets, which indicates that there are datasets to extract.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of weakly-supervised semantic segmentation and reference various datasets. I will look for specific names of datasets mentioned in this section.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used. The authors explicitly mention four datasets: **PASCAL**, **COCO**, **Cityscapes**, and **ADE20K**. I will note down the context in which each dataset is used, including any specific configurations or splits mentioned.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution. 

1. **PASCAL Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Everingham, M., Van Gool, L., Williams, C. K., Winn, J., & Zisserman, A. (2010). *The PASCAL Visual Object Classes (VOC) Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 88(2), 303-338.

2. **COCO Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Lin, T. Y., Maire, M., Belongie, S., Hays, J., Perona, P., Ramanan, D., Dollar, P., & Zitnick, C. L. (2014). *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. In European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV) (pp. 740-755).

3. **Cityscapes Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Cordts, M., Omran, M., Ramos, S., Rehfeld, T., Enzweiler, M., Benenson, R., Franke, U., Roth, S., & Schiele, B. (2016). *The Cityscapes Dataset for Semantic Urban Scene Understanding*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR) (pp. 3213-3223).

4. **ADE20K Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Zhou, B., Zhao, H., Puig, X., Fidler, S., Barriuso, A., & Torralba, A. (2017). *Scene Parsing through ADE20K Dataset*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR) (pp. 633-641).

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their proper citations.
