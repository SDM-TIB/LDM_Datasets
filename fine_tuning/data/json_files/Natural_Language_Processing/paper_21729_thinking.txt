To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Point-Based Approach to Efficient LiDAR Multi-Task Perception" by Christopher Lang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental evaluation sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method on the **nuScenes** and **KITTI** benchmarks, which suggests that these datasets are important for their research.

Next, I will look specifically at the **A. Datasets** section, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used for their evaluations. Here, I will find the following datasets:

1. **nuScenes**: The paper describes the nuScenes dataset as consisting of 1000 driving sequences, with annotations for 10 classes. It mentions the dataset's structure, including the recording frequency and the challenges posed by class imbalance.

2. **SemanticKITTI**: This dataset is described as containing 23k training samples and 20k testing samples, with panoptic segmentation annotations for various classes. The authors also mention the use of the KITTI dataset for additional evaluation metrics.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **nuScenes**, the citation is:
  > H. Caesar, V. Bankiti, A. H. Lang, S. Vora, V. E. Liong, Q. Xu, A. Krishnan, Y. Pan, G. Baldan, and O. Beijbom. *nuscenes: A multimodal dataset for autonomous driving*. In IEEE Conf. Comput. Vis. Pattern Recog., 2020, pp. 11 621–11 631.

- For **SemanticKITTI**, the citation is:
  > J. Behley, M. Garbade, A. Milioto, J. Quenzel, S. Behnke, C. Stachniss, and J. Gall. *Semantickitti: A dataset for semantic scene understanding of lidar sequences*. In Int. Conf. Comput. Vis., 2019, pp. 9297–9307.

Now that I have the dataset names and their corresponding citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that highlights each dataset's details and citations.

This systematic approach ensures that I accurately capture all relevant datasets and their citations from the paper, which is crucial for proper attribution and further research.
