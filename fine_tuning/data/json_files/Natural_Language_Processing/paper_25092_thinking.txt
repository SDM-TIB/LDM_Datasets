To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Tracing Back the Malicious Clients in Poisoning Attacks to Federated Learning" by Yuqi Jia et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract states that the authors evaluate their method on **five benchmark datasets**, which indicates that there are multiple datasets to look for.

Next, I will focus on **section 6 (Experiments)**, where the authors provide a detailed overview of the datasets used. In this section, they list the following datasets:

1. **CIFAR-10**: This dataset is commonly used for image classification tasks and consists of 50,000 training examples and 10,000 testing examples, with 10 classes.
   
2. **Fashion-MNIST**: This dataset contains 60,000 training examples and 10,000 testing examples of fashion items, also with 10 classes.

3. **MNIST**: Similar to Fashion-MNIST, this dataset includes 60,000 training examples and 10,000 testing examples of handwritten digits, with 10 classes.

4. **Sentiment140**: This is a text classification dataset for sentiment analysis, comprising 72,491 training tweets and 358 testing tweets, with 2 classes.

5. **ImageNet-Fruits**: This dataset is a subset of the ImageNet dataset, containing images of fruits, with 13,000 training examples and 500 testing examples across 10 classes.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009.

- For **Fashion-MNIST**, the citation is:
  > Han Xiao, Kashif Rasul, and Roland Vollgraf. *Fashion-MNIST: A Novel Image Dataset for Benchmarking Machine Learning Algorithms*. 2017.

- For **MNIST**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J. Burges. *MNIST Handwritten Digit Database*. 1998.

- For **Sentiment140**, the citation is:
  > Alec Go, Richa Bhayani, and Lei Huang. *Twitter Sentiment Classification Using Distant Supervision*. CS224N Project Report, Stanford, 2009.

- For **ImageNet-Fruits**, the citation is:
  > G. Cazenavette, T. Wang, A. Torralba, A. A. Efros, and J.-Y. Zhu. *Dataset Distillation by Matching Training Trajectories*. In CVPR, 2022.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant information regarding the datasets used in the research paper.
