To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "A Deep Learning Approach Towards Student Performance Prediction in Online Courses: Challenges Based on a Global Perspective" by Abdallah Moubayed et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors used three distinct datasets collected from different regions of the world to evaluate their deep learning models for predicting student performance. This suggests that there are specific datasets to look for.

Next, I will focus on **section IV (Datasetsâ€™ Description)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention three datasets:

1. **Dataset 1**: Collected from a first-year engineering course at a European University, consisting of tasks completed by 52 students who finished the course. This dataset is crucial for understanding the performance of students in a European context.

2. **Dataset 2**: Collected from a third-year engineering course at a North American University, containing records for 162 students. This dataset includes various evaluation tasks, such as assignments and exams, which are essential for performance prediction.

3. **Dataset 3**: Collected from a first-year IT course at a Middle Eastern University, involving 222 students. This dataset also includes performance records from assignments and exams, providing a diverse perspective on student performance across different educational contexts.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations related to these datasets. The paper does not provide specific citations for the datasets themselves, but it does reference other works that may have used similar datasets or methodologies. 

Since the datasets are described in detail but not cited from external sources, I will note that the authors have not provided formal citations for these datasets. However, I will still document the datasets based on the information provided in the paper.

Finally, I will compile the dataset descriptions, including the context and characteristics of each dataset, ensuring that I clearly articulate their relevance to the study's objectives. This will help in understanding how these datasets contribute to the research findings.

In summary, I will extract the datasets by focusing on the relevant sections of the paper, documenting their characteristics, and noting the absence of formal citations while ensuring clarity in the descriptions.
