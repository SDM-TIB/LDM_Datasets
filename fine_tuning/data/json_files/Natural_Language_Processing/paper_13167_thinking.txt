To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CoNe: Contrast Your Neighbours for Supervised Image Classification" by Mingkai Zheng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance across different benchmark datasets, which indicates that datasets are likely discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In **section 4.1**, the authors explicitly mention two datasets:

1. **CIFAR-10 Dataset**: This dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images across 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. It is divided into 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images.

2. **CIFAR-100 Dataset**: Similar to CIFAR-10, this dataset contains 60,000 images but is divided into 100 classes, with 600 images per class. It has 500 training images and 100 testing images per class.

The authors provide a brief description of each dataset, which confirms their relevance to the experiments conducted in the paper.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **CIFAR-10 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Krizhevsky, A. (2009). *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. 

- For **CIFAR-100 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Krizhevsky, A. (2009). *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*.

Both datasets are referenced from the same source, which is a common practice in the literature.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations as required. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
