To extract datasets from the research paper titled "FuLG: 150B Romanian Corpus for Language Model Pretraining" by Vlad-Andrei Bădoiu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are introduced or referenced. The abstract mentions the release of **FuLG**, a Romanian corpus derived from CommonCrawl, which indicates that this is a primary dataset of interest.

Next, I will look for specific sections that detail the datasets used, particularly the **Data Acquisition and Filtering** section. Here, the authors describe the process of creating the **FuLG** dataset, which is a 156B-token corpus filtered from CommonCrawl. This section provides insights into the methodology but does not mention additional datasets explicitly.

I will also check the **References section** to find citations for any datasets mentioned. The authors reference several datasets in the context of their work, including:

1. **CommonCrawl**: This is a foundational dataset used for extracting the Romanian corpus. The citation for CommonCrawl is:
   > CommonCrawl. *CommonCrawl: A Public Repository of Crawled Web Pages*. https://commoncrawl.org.

2. **Dolma**: Mentioned as a large dataset in the related work section. The citation is:
   > Luca Soldaini et al. 2024. *Dolma: An open corpus of three trillion tokens for language model pretraining research*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2402.00159.

3. **OSCAR**: Another dataset referenced in the context of training models. The citation is:
   > Pedro Javier Ortiz Suárez et al. 2019. *Asynchronous pipelines for processing huge corpora on medium to low resource infrastructures*. Proceedings of the Workshop on Challenges in the Management of Large Corpora (CMLC-7), 2019. https://doi.org/10.14618/ids-pub-9021.

4. **mC4**: This dataset is also mentioned in the context of model training. The citation is:
   > Colin Raffel et al. 2019. *Exploring the Limits of Transfer Learning with a Unified Text-to-Text Transformer*. arXiv e-prints, arXiv:1910.10683.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets referenced in the paper, along with their respective citations for further reference.
