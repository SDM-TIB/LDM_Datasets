To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Interference Management for Full-Duplex ISAC in B5G/6G Networks" by Aimin Tang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets or experimental data. The abstract provides a high-level overview, but it may not contain specific dataset names. The introduction may provide context or references to datasets used in the research.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **experiments** within the paper. This section is likely to contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used, including their names, sizes, and any relevant characteristics. If such a section is not explicitly labeled, I will check the **methodology** or **results** sections, as they often discuss the datasets employed in the experiments.

As I read through these sections, I will take note of any datasets mentioned, including their names and descriptions. If the authors refer to specific datasets without providing full citations, I will need to look for these citations in the **References section** of the paper.

Once I identify the datasets, I will locate their full citations in the **References section**. This is crucial, as proper citation is essential for academic integrity and allows others to find the original sources of the datasets.

For example, if the authors mention a dataset like "XYZ Dataset" in the experiments section, I will look for its citation in the References. If the citation is not directly provided, I may need to search for the dataset online or in academic databases to find the correct citation.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations. This will ensure that I have a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.

Finally, I will organize this information clearly, making it easy to understand and reference for future use or analysis.
