To extract datasets from the research paper titled "aTrain: Introducing an Interface for the Accessible Transcription of Interviews" by Armin Haberla et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly referenced. The abstract discusses the tool aTrain and its capabilities but does not mention specific datasets. Therefore, I will proceed to the introduction.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of transcribing interviews and mention the use of OpenAI's Whisper model for transcription. However, they do not specify any datasets at this point. I will continue to the **main features section** and **technology and programming sections** to look for any datasets used for training or evaluation.

In the **main features section**, the authors describe the capabilities of aTrain, including automated transcription and speaker detection, but again do not mention specific datasets. 

Next, I will check the **experiments section** where they might provide details about the datasets used for benchmarking the transcription tool. Here, they mention using the **Librispeech corpus** for testing the transcription capabilities of aTrain. This is a significant dataset in the field of speech recognition.

Now, I will look for the full citation of the **Librispeech corpus** in the **references section**. The citation is as follows:
> Panayotov, V., Chen, G., Povey, D., Khudanpur, S. (2015). *Librispeech: An ASR corpus based on public domain audio books*. In Proceedings of the 2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP), IEEE, pp. 5206–5210. doi:10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178964.

Additionally, the authors mention the use of the **Whisper model** developed by OpenAI, which is referenced in the paper. The citation for this model is:
> Radford, A., Kim, J.W., Xu, T., Brockman, G., McLeavey, C., Sutskever, I. (2023). *Robust speech recognition via large-scale weak supervision*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Machine Learning, PMLR, pp. 28492–28518.

Now that I have identified the relevant datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. The key dataset extracted is the **Librispeech corpus**, and I will ensure to include the full citation for it as well as the Whisper model reference.
