To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Semi-Supervised Approach for Power System Event Identification" by Nima Taghipourbazargani et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors developed a comprehensive Event Identification package, which suggests that they may have generated or utilized specific datasets.

Next, I will focus on **Section II (Generation of the Synthetic Eventful Time-Series PMU Data)**, where the authors describe the process of generating synthetic PMU data. They mention creating eventful data for a specific system, the **South Carolina 500-Bus synthetic network**. This is a key dataset that I need to document.

In this section, the authors detail the types of events they generated, including load loss, generation loss, line trip, and bus fault events. They state that they simulated a total of **1827 events**, which includes 500 load loss events, 500 generation loss events, 500 line trip events, and 327 bus fault events. This information is crucial for describing the dataset.

I will also check the **References section** to find any citations related to the datasets mentioned. The authors refer to their previous work for methodologies used in feature extraction, which may also provide context for the dataset.

The full citation for the dataset generated in this study is as follows:
- **South Carolina 500-Bus synthetic network**:

Now, I will compile the dataset information, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and full citation in a structured format for further processing. This will ensure that all relevant details are captured accurately for future reference or analysis.
