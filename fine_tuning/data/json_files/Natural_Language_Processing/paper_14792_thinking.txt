To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ProbTS: Benchmarking Point and Distributional Forecasting across Diverse Prediction Horizons" by Jiawen Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions and may highlight key datasets used in the study. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets, which can help in understanding their relevance.

Next, I will focus on the **Datasets section** (likely found in the methodology or results sections) where the authors typically describe the datasets in detail. This section should provide specific names, characteristics, and any relevant statistics about the datasets used in their experiments.

In this paper, I will look for mentions of datasets such as:

1. **ETTh1 and ETTh2**: These datasets are likely used for long-term forecasting and may include details about their structure and the number of variables.
2. **ETTm1 and ETTm2**: Similar to the ETTh datasets, these may also be used for long-term forecasting.
3. **Electricity**: This dataset is often used in time-series forecasting and may have specific characteristics related to energy consumption.
4. **Traffic**: This dataset may include data on traffic flow or occupancy rates.
5. **Exchange**: This dataset likely contains exchange rate data, which is common in financial forecasting.
6. **ILI (Influenza-like Illness)**: This dataset may track health-related metrics.
7. **Weather**: This dataset may include climatological data.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. Each dataset should have a corresponding citation that provides the original source or publication where the dataset was introduced or described. This is crucial for proper attribution and for readers who may want to access the datasets themselves.

For example, I might find citations like:

- For **ETTh1 and ETTh2**:
  > "ETTh1 and ETTh2 datasets are described in the work by [Author et al., Year]."

- For **Electricity**:
  > "Electricity dataset is sourced from [Author et al., Year]."

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset names, their descriptions, and the full citations into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset's details and references.

Finally, I will ensure that all entries are accurate and complete, ready for any further processing or review.
