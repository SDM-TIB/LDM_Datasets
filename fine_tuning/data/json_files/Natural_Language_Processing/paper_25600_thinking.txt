To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Robust personalized pricing under uncertainty of purchase probabilities" by Shunnosuke Ikeda et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on personalized pricing and mentions the use of both synthetic and real-world datasets, which indicates that I should look for specific names or descriptions of these datasets.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section, where the authors discuss the context of personalized pricing and the importance of accurate demand forecasting. They mention conducting numerical experiments using both synthetic and real-world datasets, which suggests that these datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

In the **experimental results section**, the authors describe their experiments with synthetic datasets and a real-world dataset. They specifically mention six synthetic datasets generated from various purchase probability models, which are detailed in a table. I will extract the names and descriptions of these datasets:

1. **Dataset1**: Linear probit model with no confounding (n = 1).
2. **Dataset2**: Higher dimension probit model with sparse linear interaction (n = 20).
3. **Dataset3**: Probit model with step interaction (n = 1).
4. **Dataset4**: Probit model with multi-dimensional step interaction (n = 2).
5. **Dataset5**: Linear probit model with observed confounding (n = 1).
6. **Dataset6**: Probit model with non-linear interaction (n = 2).

Additionally, the authors mention using a real-world dataset from Dunnhumby titled "The complete journey," which includes transactional grocery purchase data from 2,500 households.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. However, since the synthetic datasets are generated models and may not have formal citations, I will focus on the real-world dataset citation:

- For the **Dunnhumby dataset**, the citation is:
  > Dunnhumby. *The complete journey*. Available at: https://www.dunnhumby.com/source-files/

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and citations where applicable. This will ensure that I have a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
