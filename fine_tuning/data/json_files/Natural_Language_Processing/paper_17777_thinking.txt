To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Quantifying Stability of Non-Power-Seeking in Artificial Agents" by Evan Ryan Gunter et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to look for any references to datasets. The abstract provides a concise overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments and results sections**. These sections typically contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used for evaluation, including their characteristics, size, and any specific configurations or splits that were applied. I will pay close attention to any tables or figures that may summarize the datasets.

If the paper mentions any datasets, I will note their names and descriptions. For example, if the authors refer to a specific dataset used for training or testing their models, I will extract that information.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial, as proper citation allows others to locate the datasets easily. I will ensure to capture all relevant details such as authors, title, publication venue, and year.

For instance, if the paper mentions a dataset like "OpenAI Gym," I would look for its citation in the references, which might look something like this:
> Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L., Schneider, J., & Schulman, J. (2016). *OpenAI Gym*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01583.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation.

Finally, I will format the extracted information in a clear and organized manner, ready for any further processing or review.
