To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Applying Intrinsic Debiasing on Downstream Tasks: Challenges and Considerations for Machine Translation" by Bar Iluz et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract discusses the impact of intrinsic debiasing on neural machine translation models, which suggests that datasets are likely involved in the experiments. The introduction further elaborates on the challenges of gender bias in machine translation, indicating that specific datasets may have been used to evaluate the proposed methods.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments or evaluation sections**. In this paper, I find a table (Table 1) that lists datasets used for evaluating different target languages, which is crucial for my extraction process. The table specifies the dataset names, sizes, and target languages.

The datasets mentioned in the paper are:

1. **newstest2019**: This dataset contains 1997 sentences and is used for evaluating the German language.
2. **newstest2012**: This dataset contains 3003 sentences and is used for evaluating the Russian language.
3. **TED dev**: This dataset contains 1000 sentences and is used for evaluating the Hebrew language.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The paper mentions that the Russian and German datasets are described in Choshen and Abend (2021), and the Hebrew dataset is based on the Opus TED talks dataset, which is cited as follows:

- For the **Russian and German datasets**:
  > Leshem Choshen and Omri Abend. 2021. Transition based graph decoder for neural machine translation. ArXiv preprint, abs/2101.12640.

- For the **Hebrew dataset**:
  > Nils Reimers and Iryna Gurevych. 2020. Making monolingual sentence embeddings multilingual using knowledge distillation. In Proceedings of the 2020 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), pages 4512â€“4525, Online. Association for Computational Linguistics.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. This will ensure that I have a clear record of the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
