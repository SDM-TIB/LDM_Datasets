To extract datasets from the research paper titled "RenderNet: Visual Relocalization Using Virtual Viewpoints in Large-Scale Indoor Environments" by Jiahui Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the **InLoc dataset**, which is used for evaluating the proposed method. This indicates that there is at least one dataset to extract.

Next, I will look for specific details about the datasets in the **experiments section**. In this section, the authors describe the **InLoc dataset** in detail, stating that it contains 4680 RGB database images and 356 RGB query images with ground truth poses. This dataset is crucial for their evaluation and is explicitly mentioned.

Additionally, I will check the **training data section**, where the authors mention using the **ScanNet dataset** to train their model. The ScanNet dataset consists of RGB-D video data with camera poses and dense depth maps, which is relevant for their training process.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to gather the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **InLoc dataset**, the citation is:
   > Hajime Taira, Masatoshi Okutomi, Torsten Sattler, Mircea Cimpoi, Marc Pollefeys, Josef Sivic, Tomas Pajdla, and Akihiko Torii. *InLoc: Indoor visual localization with dense matching and view synthesis*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 7199–7209, 2018.

2. For the **ScanNet dataset**, the citation is:
   > Angela Dai, Angel X Chang, Manolis Savva, Maciej Halber, Thomas Funkhouser, and Matthias Nießner. *ScanNet: Richly-annotated 3D reconstructions of indoor scenes*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 5828–5839, 2017.

With these citations in hand, I will now prepare to create structured entries for each dataset, ensuring that I include all relevant details and citations as required.
