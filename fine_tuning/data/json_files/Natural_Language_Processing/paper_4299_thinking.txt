To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Advancing CTC-CRF Based End-to-End Speech Recognition with Wordpieces and Conformers" by Huahuan Zheng et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that experiments were conducted on **two English datasets (Switchboard, Librispeech)** and a **German dataset from CommonVoice**. This gives me a clear starting point for the datasets I need to extract.

Next, I will look into **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the datasets used. They mention:

1. **Switchboard Dataset**: This dataset consists of 260 hours of conversational speech data. It is commonly used for training and evaluating automatic speech recognition systems.

2. **Librispeech Dataset**: This dataset includes 1000 hours of English speech data derived from audiobooks, which is also widely used in ASR research.

3. **CommonVoice German Dataset**: This dataset is part of Mozilla's CommonVoice project and contains around 700 hours of German speech data.

To ensure I have the correct details, I will also check the **References section** for full citations of these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For the **Switchboard Dataset**:

- For the **Librispeech Dataset**:
  > Vassil Panayotov, Guoguo Chen, Daniel Povey, and Sanjeev Khudanpur. "Librispeech: An ASR corpus based on public domain audio books." In 2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP), pp. 5206–5210, 2015.

- For the **CommonVoice German Dataset**:

"Common Voice: A massively-multilingual speech corpus." In Proceedings of the 12th Language Resources and Evaluation Conference, pp. 4218–4222, 2019.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their full citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their respective references.
