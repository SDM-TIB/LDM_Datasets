To extract datasets from the research paper titled "VERSE: Virtual-Gradient Aware Streaming Lifelong Learning with Anytime Inference" by Soumya Banerjee et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on "diverse datasets with temporally correlated observations," which indicates that datasets are indeed used, but I need to find their specific names.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (Section IV) where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they list three datasets:

1. **iCub1.0**: This dataset involves object recognition from video frame sequences, with each frame containing a single object instance.
2. **iCub28**: Similar to iCub1.0, this dataset spans across four days and also involves object recognition from video frame sequences.
3. **CoRe50**: This dataset includes temporally ordered images divided into 11 sessions with varying backgrounds and lighting.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **iCub1.0**, the citation is:
  > S. Fanello, C. Ciliberto, M. Santoro, L. Natale, G. Metta, L. Rosasco, and F. Odone. *iCub World: Friendly Robots Help Building Good Vision Data-sets*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops, pages 700–705, 2013.

- For **iCub28**, the citation is:
  > G. Pasquale, C. Ciliberto, F. Odone, L. Rosasco, and L. Natale. *Teaching iCub to Recognize Objects Using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks*. In Machine Learning for Interactive Systems, PMLR, pages 21–25, 2015.

- For **CoRe50**, the citation is:
  > V. Lomonaco and D. Maltoni. *Core50: A New Dataset and Benchmark for Continuous Object Recognition*. In Conference on Robot Learning, PMLR, pages 17–26, 2017.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. Each dataset will be documented with its name, description, and full citation to ensure clarity and proper attribution.
