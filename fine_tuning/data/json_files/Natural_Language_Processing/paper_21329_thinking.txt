To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Order-Based Pre-training Strategies for Procedural Text Understanding" by Abhilash Nandy et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluated their methods on two downstream Entity-Tracking datasets: **NPN-Cooking dataset** and **ProPara dataset**. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for the study.

Next, I will examine the **introduction section** for more context about these datasets. The authors state that their methods show improvements on the NPN-Cooking dataset (Bosselut et al., 2017) and the ProPara dataset (Mishra et al., 2018). This confirms the datasets' relevance and provides initial citations.

In the **experiments section**, specifically section 4, the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used. They mention:

1. **NPN-Cooking dataset**: This dataset consists of 65,816 training, 175 development, and 700 evaluation recipes. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Antoine Bosselut, Omer Levy, Ari Holtzman, Corin Ennis, Dieter Fox, and Yejin Choi. *Simulating action dynamics with neural process networks*. In Proceedings of the 31st Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS), 2017.

2. **ProPara dataset**: This dataset contains 488 human-authored procedures with 81k annotations regarding changing states of entities. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Bhavana Dalvi Mishra, Lifu Huang, Niket Tandon, Wen-tau Yih, and Peter Clark. *Tracking state changes in procedural text: A challenge dataset and models for process paragraph comprehension*. In Proceedings of the 2018 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), 2018.

Now, I will ensure that I have the full citations for both datasets, as they are essential for proper documentation.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This structured approach will help in accurately documenting the datasets used in the research paper.
