To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Calibration in Machine Learning Uncertainty Quantification: beyond consistency to target adaptivity" by Pascal Pernot, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on uncertainty quantification (UQ) in machine learning, but it may not specify datasets directly. The introduction may provide context or references to datasets used in the study.

Next, I will look for specific sections that discuss datasets, such as **section II (Validation of Variance-Based UQ Metrics)** and **section IV (Conclusions)**. In these sections, the author discusses the QM9 dataset as a representative example for validating UQ metrics. 

In section II, the author mentions the QM9 dataset, which consists of 13,885 atomization energies (V, uV), reference values (R), and molecular formulas. This is a clear indication of a dataset being used in the study.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the QM9 dataset. The citation is typically provided in the references, and I will ensure to format it correctly. The QM9 dataset is referenced in the context of a study by Busk et al., which is crucial for proper citation.

The citation for the QM9 dataset is:
> J. Busk, P. B. JÃ¸rgensen, A. Bhowmik, M. N. Schmidt, O. Winther, and T. Vegge. *Calibrated uncertainty for molecular property prediction using ensembles of message passing neural networks*. Mach. Learn.: Sci. Technol., 3:015012, 2022.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring to include the dataset name, description, and full citation in the required format. 

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for review or further processing, ensuring that all details are accurate and complete.
