To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Sparse Graph Sequences, Generalized Graphons and Signal Processing" by Feng Ji, Xingchao Jian, and Wee Peng Tay, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections that discuss experiments or applications** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract provides a general overview, but I will focus on sections that are likely to contain specific dataset information.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any mentions of datasets used in the research. If the authors reference any datasets or benchmarks, I will note their names and any relevant details provided.

I will then look for a dedicated **section on datasets or experiments**. This section typically contains detailed descriptions of the datasets used, including their characteristics, sizes, and any specific configurations relevant to the study. If such a section exists, I will extract the names and descriptions of the datasets mentioned.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily. I will ensure to note the authors, title, publication venue, and year for each dataset.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like "ogbn-arXiv," I will look for its citation in the references, which might look something like this:
> "ogbn-arXiv: A Large-Scale Citation Network Dataset for Graph Neural Networks." In Proceedings of the 2020 International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR), 2020.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation as found in the references.

Finally, I will organize this information clearly, ready for any further processing or presentation as needed.
