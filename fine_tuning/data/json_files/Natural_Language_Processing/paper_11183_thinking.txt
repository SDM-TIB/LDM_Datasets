To extract datasets from the research paper titled "AutoExp: A multidisciplinary, multi-sensor framework to evaluate human activities in self-driving cars" by Carlos Crispim-Junior et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the paper proposes a framework for studying in-cabin human activities and mentions the creation of a dataset for this purpose, which is a good starting point.

Next, I will focus on **section IV (AutoBehave Experiment)**, where the authors describe the experimentation conducted using the AutoExp framework. Here, they mention the **AutoBehave dataset**, which is specifically created to capture non-driving related activities of occupants in self-driving cars. The dataset is characterized as a multi-sensor, multidisciplinary dataset, which is crucial for my extraction.

In this section, the authors provide details about the dataset, including the number of participants (29), the types of activities recorded, and the conditions under which the data was collected. This information is essential for a comprehensive description of the dataset.

I will also check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned in the paper. The authors reference several datasets that are relevant to their work, including:

1. **DriPE dataset**:

3. **DMD dataset**:

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets referenced in the paper, ready for further processing or review.
