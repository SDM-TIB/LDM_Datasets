To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Prompting Multilingual Large Language Models to Generate Code-Mixed Texts: The Case of South East Asian Languages" by Zheng-Xin Yong et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the challenges of collecting code-mixed data and hints at the use of multilingual LLMs, which suggests that datasets may be involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention the scarcity of publicly available code-mixed datasets relevant to South East Asian (SEA) languages. This indicates that they might reference specific datasets later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, where the authors describe their approach to generating code-mixed data using various LLMs. They mention prompting models like ChatGPT, InstructGPT, BLOOMZ, and Flan-T5-XXL, but I need to look for specific datasets used for evaluation or training.

In the **results section**, the authors analyze the performance of these models in generating code-mixed data. They may reference specific datasets used for evaluation, which I need to capture.

After identifying any datasets mentioned, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for these datasets. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for the datasets used in the research.

For example, if the authors mention a dataset like "Nusacrowd" or "NusaX," I will look for the corresponding citations in the references to ensure I have the complete information.

Once I have gathered all the relevant datasets and their citations, I will compile them into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets referenced in the paper, which is essential for transparency and reproducibility in research.
