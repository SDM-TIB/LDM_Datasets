To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "Computer-Assisted Creation of Boolean Search Rules for Text Classification in the Legal Domain" by Hannes Westermann et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and datasets sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their classifiers on **four datasets**, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they provide detailed descriptions of each dataset, which is crucial for my extraction process.

The datasets mentioned in the paper are:

1. **Veterans Claims Dataset**: This dataset consists of 50 fact-finding decisions from the U.S. Board of Veterans’ Appeals related to PTSD claims. The sentences are tagged with rhetorical roles.

2. **Court Decisions Segmentation Dataset**: This dataset includes 316 court decisions, annotated for high-level functional parts. The authors used cases in the area of cyber crime for their tests.

3. **The Trade Secrets Factors Dataset**: This dataset comprises 172 trade secret misappropriation cases, labeled by applicable factors. The authors focused on the existence of security measures for their experiments.

4. **The Statutory Interpretation Dataset**: This dataset contains sentences from court opinions that elaborate on vague statutory terms. The authors manually classified sentences into four categories based on their usefulness for interpretation.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are essential for proper attribution and to provide context for the datasets used in the research.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
