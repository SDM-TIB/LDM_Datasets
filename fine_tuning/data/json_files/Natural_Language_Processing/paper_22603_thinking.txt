To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A unified cross-attention model for predicting antigen binding specificity to both HLA and TCR molecules" by Chenpeng Yu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on predicting antigen binding specificity, which suggests that datasets related to antigen-HLA and antigen-TCR interactions may be present.

Next, I will examine **section 4 (Methods)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, the authors mention the creation of a benchmark dataset of HLA-peptide bindings derived from over ten previous studies. They specify that this dataset contains **423,843 pHLA binders**, which is a significant dataset for the study.

Additionally, I will look for any other datasets mentioned in the **results section**. The authors discuss performance evaluations on various datasets, including:

1. **HPV Antigen Dataset**: This dataset includes **278 experimentally verified pHLA bindings** derived from HPV16 proteins E6 and E7.
2. **Neoantigen Validation Dataset**: This dataset consists of **221 experimentally verified pHLA bindings** collected from various cancer studies.
3. **TCR-Peptide Binding Dataset**: The authors created a dataset with **109,554 pairs** of TCR and peptide bindings.
4. **Independent Test Set**: This set includes **63,324 HLA-antigen-TCR triplet pairs**.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **HLA-peptide binding dataset**:
  > The dataset is compiled from over ten previous studies, but specific citations are not provided in the text. I will note that it is a compilation and may require further investigation to find the original studies.

- For the **HPV Antigen Dataset**:
  > Bonsack, M. et al. *Performance evaluation of MHC class-I binding prediction tools based on an experimentally validated MHC–peptide binding data set*. Cancer Immunology Research, 7, 719–736 (2019).

- For the **Neoantigen Validation Dataset**:
  > Wells, D. K. et al. *Key parameters of tumor epitope immunogenicity revealed through a consortium approach improve neoantigen prediction*. Cell, 183, 818–834 (2020).

- For the **TCR-Peptide Binding Dataset**:
  > The dataset is created by the authors, so no external citation is available.

- For the **Independent Test Set**:
  > The dataset is also created by the authors, so no external citation is available.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and citations. This will ensure that all relevant information is documented clearly and accurately for future reference or analysis.
