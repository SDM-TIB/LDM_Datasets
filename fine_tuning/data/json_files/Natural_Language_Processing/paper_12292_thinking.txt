To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A reinforcement learning approach for VQA validation: an application to diabetic macular edema grading" by Tatiana Fountoukidou and Raphael Sznitman, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study focuses on evaluating algorithms related to diabetic macular edema (DME) grading, which suggests that relevant datasets may be discussed.

Next, I will specifically look for sections that detail the datasets used in the experiments. In the **experimental setup section**, the authors mention two datasets:

1. **Indian Diabetic Retinopathy Image Dataset (IDRiD)**: This dataset consists of 148 color fundus images from both healthy and diabetic retinopathy subjects, with segmentation masks for the optic disc and hard exudates. The dataset is split into training, validation, and test sets in a 60%-10%-30% ratio.

2. **e-Ophtha Dataset**: This dataset includes 62 color fundus images from healthy and diabetic retinopathy subjects, also with segmentation masks for hard exudates and optic disc localization. Similar to IDRiD, it is split into training, validation, and test sets in a 60%-10%-30% ratio.

I will confirm the use of these datasets in the **results section**, where the authors discuss their findings based on these datasets, ensuring that they are indeed the datasets utilized for the experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **IDRiD dataset**, the citation is:
  > Prasanna, P., Samiksha, P., Ravi, K., Manesh, K., Girish, D., Vivek, S., Meriaudeau, F. (2018). *Indian diabetic retinopathy image dataset (IDRiD)*.

- For the **e-Ophtha dataset**, the citation is:
  > Decencière, E., Cazuguel, G., Zhang, X., Thibault, G., Klein, J.C., Meyer, F., Marcotegui, B., Quellec, G., Lamard, M., Danno, R., et al. (2013). *Teleophta: Machine learning and image processing methods for teleophthalmology*. Irbm, 34, 196–203.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
