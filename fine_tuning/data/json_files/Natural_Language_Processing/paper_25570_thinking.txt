To extract datasets from the research paper titled "When Do Universal Image Jailbreaks Transfer Between Vision-Language Models?" by Rylan Schaeffer et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any references to datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly where the authors discuss the datasets used for optimizing image jailbreaks. In this section, they mention three specific datasets:

1. **AdvBench**: This dataset is described as containing highly formulaic responses to harmful prompts, with a total of 416 training and 104 test prompt-response pairs.

2. **Anthropic HHH**: This dataset consists of human preference comparisons and was modified to create a subset of harmful-yet-helpful responses, also containing 416 training and 104 test pairs.

3. **Generated Data**: This dataset was created by generating harmful prompts and responses across 51 topics, resulting in 48,000 training and 12,000 test pairs.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For **AdvBench**, the citation is:

For **Anthropic HHH**, the citation is:
> Ganguli, D., Lovitt, L., Kernion, J., Askell, A., Bai, Y., Kadavath, S., Mann, B., Perez, E., Schiefer, N., Ndousse, K., Jones, A., Bowman, S., Chen, A., Conerly, T., DasSarma, N., Drain, D., Elhage, N., El-Showk, S., Fort, Z., Hatfield-Dodds, T., Henighan, D., Hernandez, D., Hume, T., Jacobson, J., Johnston, S., Kravec, S., Olsson, C., Ringer, E., Tran-Johnson, D., Amodei, D. (2022). Red teaming language models to reduce harms: Methods, scaling behaviors, and lessons learned. *arXiv preprint arXiv:2209.00796*.

For the **Generated Data**, since it is a dataset created by the authors themselves, I will note that it does not have a separate citation but is described in detail in the methodology section.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant information regarding the datasets used in the research paper.
