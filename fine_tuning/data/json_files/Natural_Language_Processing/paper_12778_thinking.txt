To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Generative Adversarial Networks for Stain Normalisation in Histopathology" by Jack Breen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the study, which may include references to specific datasets used for experiments or evaluations.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methods** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors discuss various stain normalisation methods and their evaluations, which may involve specific datasets. I will pay close attention to any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

As I read through the paper, I will note any datasets that are referenced, particularly those used for training or testing the models. For instance, if the authors mention using datasets from specific challenges or studies, I will highlight those.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets themselves.

For example, if the authors mention using the **MIDOG 2021 Challenge training set**, I will look for the corresponding citation in the references. Similarly, if they refer to datasets like **Lymph Node Metastasis** or any other specific datasets, I will ensure to find their full citations.

Once I have gathered all the relevant information about the datasets, including their names, descriptions, and citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly presents each dataset's details.

Finally, I will ensure that each dataset entry includes the full citation, as this is essential for academic integrity and allows others to reference the original sources effectively. This process will ensure that I have accurately extracted and documented the datasets used in the research paper.
