To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Simple yet Effective Code-Switching Language Identification with Multitask Pre-Training and Transfer Learning" by Shuyue Stella Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors focus on an English-Mandarin child-directed speech dataset, which suggests that there are specific datasets used in their experiments.

Next, I will examine **section 4.1 (Dataset & Metric)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention several datasets:

1. **LibriSpeech**: This dataset is described as containing 100 hours of English speech. It is a well-known corpus for automatic speech recognition tasks.
   
2. **National Speech Corpus of Singapore (NSC)**: This dataset consists of 100 hours of English speech collected in Singapore, which is relevant for their study on language identification in a multilingual context.

3. **AISHELL**: This dataset includes 200 hours of Mandarin speech and is also widely used for speech recognition tasks.

4. **SEAME**: This dataset is a Mandarin-English code-switching speech corpus, containing 100 hours of data, which is crucial for their code-switching language identification task.

5. **MERLIon**: This dataset is specifically mentioned as containing both English and Mandarin speech, with a total of approximately 30 hours of data. It is used for training and evaluation in their experiments.

After identifying these datasets, I will proceed to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are essential for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

The full citations I will extract are:

- **LibriSpeech**:
  > Viorica Marian and Anthony Shook. *The cognitive benefits of being bilingual*. In Cerebrum: the Dana forum on brain science, volume 2012. Dana Foundation.

- **National Speech Corpus of Singapore (NSC)**:

- **AISHELL**:
  > Hui Bu, Jiayu Du, Xingyu Na, Bengu Wu, and Hao Zheng. *AISHELL-1: An open-source Mandarin speech corpus and a speech recognition baseline*. In 2017 20th COCOSDA, pages 1–5. IEEE.

- **SEAME**:
  > Dau-Cheng Lyu, Tien Ping Tan, Chng Eng Siong, and Haizhou Li. *SEAME: A Mandarin-English code-switching speech corpus in South-East Asia*. In Inter-speech, 2010.

- **MERLIon**:
  > Y. H. Victoria Chua, Leibny Paola Garcia Perera, Sanjeev Khudanpur, Andy W. H. Khong, Justin Dauwels, Fei Ting Woon, and Suzy J Styles. *Development and evaluation data for multilingual everyday recordings - language identification on code-switched child-directed speech (MERLIon CCS) challenge*. In DR-NTU (Data), 2023.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
