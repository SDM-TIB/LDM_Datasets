To extract datasets from the research paper titled "UniOcc: Unifying Vision-Centric 3D Occupancy Prediction with Geometric and Semantic Rendering" by Mingjie Pan et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors participated in the **nuScenes Open Dataset Challenge**, which suggests that the nuScenes dataset is relevant.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors provide details about the datasets used. In **section 3.1**, they mention the **3D Occupancy Prediction Challenge Dataset**, which contains 700 training sequences, 150 validation sequences, and 150 testing sequences. They also provide specifics about the image data and voxel sizes, confirming that this dataset is central to their experiments.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the datasets mentioned. The authors reference the **nuScenes dataset** and the **3D Occupancy Prediction Challenge Dataset**. 

For the **3D Occupancy Prediction Challenge Dataset**, the citation is:
> Xiaoyu Tian, Tao Jiang, Longfei Yun, Yue Wang, Yilun Wang, and Hang Zhao. *Occ3d: A large-scale 3d occupancy prediction benchmark for autonomous driving*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2023.

For the **nuScenes dataset**, the citation is:
> Holger Caesar, Jasper Uijlings, and Vittorio Ferrari. *nuScenes: A multimodal dataset for autonomous driving*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2020.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
