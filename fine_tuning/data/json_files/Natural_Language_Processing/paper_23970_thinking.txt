To extract datasets from the research paper titled "TGB 2.0: A Benchmark for Learning on Temporal Knowledge Graphs and Heterogeneous Graphs" by Julia Gastinger et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and datasets section** of the paper. The abstract mentions the introduction of a novel benchmarking framework called TGB 2.0, which indicates that multiple datasets are likely discussed.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Datasets)**, where the authors describe the eight novel datasets introduced in TGB 2.0. This section is crucial as it provides detailed information about each dataset, including their names, characteristics, and intended tasks.

The datasets mentioned in this section are:

1. **tkgl-smallpedia**: A Temporal Knowledge Graph dataset constructed from the Wikidata Knowledge Graph, containing temporal relations and static relations. The task is to predict future facts.

2. **tkgl-polecat**: Based on the POLitical Event Classification dataset, this TKG dataset records interactions between socio-political actors and aims to predict future political events.

3. **tkgl-icews**: Extracted from the ICEWS Coded Event Data, this dataset spans political events from 1995 to 2022 and is classified based on the CAMEO taxonomy.

4. **tkgl-wikidata**: A superset of tkgl-smallpedia, this dataset includes temporal relations between Wikidata entities and aims to forecast future properties.

5. **thgl-software**: A Temporal Heterogeneous Graph dataset based on GitHub data, focusing on predicting the next activity of entities.

6. **thgl-forum**: This dataset is based on user and subreddit interactions on Reddit, aiming to predict future interactions.

7. **thgl-myket**: Based on the Myket Android App market, this dataset includes user interactions and aims to predict installation or update actions.

8. **thgl-github**: Another dataset based on GitHub data, tracking user activities and aiming to predict future actions.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are essential for proper attribution and to provide context for the datasets used in the research.

The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- **tkgl-smallpedia**: 
  > Denny Vrandečić and Markus Krötzsch. *Wikidata: A free collaborative knowledge base*. Communications of the ACM, 57(10):78–85, 2014.

- **thgl-github**:

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations into a structured format for further processing or review.
