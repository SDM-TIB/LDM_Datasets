To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Exploring Gene Regulatory Interaction Networks and predicting therapeutic molecules for Hypopharyngeal Cancer and EGFR-mutated lung adenocarcinoma" by Md Manowarul Islam et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors collected **Microarray datasets from GEO (Gene Expression Omnibus)**, which suggests that specific datasets are used in their research.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly the subsection titled **Dataset Selection**. Here, the authors explicitly mention two datasets:

1. **GSE212398**: This dataset is related to Hypopharyngeal Cancer and contains 8 samples, including 4 control and 4 knockout samples. The authors note that this dataset is a subseries of GSE212399.

2. **GSE198672**: This dataset pertains to EGFR-mutated lung adenocarcinoma and also contains 8 samples.

The authors clarify that both datasets were sourced from the NCBI GEO database, which is crucial for proper citation.

Now, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. Since the datasets are from GEO, I will reference the GEO database itself, which typically does not have a traditional citation format but can be cited as follows:

- For **GSE212398**, the citation is:
  > NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus. *GSE212398: RELA is dependent on CD271 expression and stem-like features in Hypopharyngeal cancer*. Available at: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE212398.

- For **GSE198672**, the citation is:
  > NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus. *GSE198672: EGFR-mutated lung adenocarcinomas develop from pre-existing tumor cells*. Available at: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE198672.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for clarity and future reference. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their respective citations.
