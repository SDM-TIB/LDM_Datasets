To extract datasets from the research paper titled "LLMC: Benchmarking Large Language Model Quantization with a Versatile Compression Toolkit" by Shiqiao Gu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used in the research.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of large language models (LLMs) and mention the need for effective benchmarking, which implies the use of datasets for evaluation. I will look for specific names of datasets in this section.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. The authors categorize the evaluation datasets into **upstream and downstream datasets**. They explicitly mention:

1. **WikiText2**: This dataset is used for evaluating perplexity metrics.
2. **C4**: Another dataset mentioned for perplexity evaluation.
3. **MMLU**: A benchmark for measuring multitask language understanding.
4. **ARC-e**: A dataset for evaluating reasoning capabilities.
5. **BoolQ**: A dataset for yes/no question answering.
6. **HellaSwag**: A dataset for commonsense reasoning.
7. **PIQA**: A dataset for physical commonsense reasoning.
8. **GPQA**: A graduate-level question answering benchmark.
9. **MBPP**: A dataset for program synthesis tasks.
10. **Human-Eval**: A dataset for evaluating code generation.
11. **LongBench**: A dataset for long context evaluation.
12. **MME**: A multimodal evaluation benchmark.

The authors also mention the use of **Pile (val)** as calibration data, which is crucial for their experiments.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

Now that I have gathered the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
