To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Textual Inversion and Self-supervised Refinement for Radiology Report Generation" by Yuanjiang Luo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on "two widely-used public datasets," which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experiment)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. They state that they conducted experiments on:

1. **IU X-ray Dataset**: This dataset contains 7,470 chest X-ray images and 3,955 corresponding reports. The authors mention that they followed specific data processing methods and divided the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets.

2. **MIMIC-CXR Dataset**: This larger dataset includes 377,110 images and 227,835 corresponding reports. The authors note that they used the official splits for this dataset.

To ensure I have the correct citations, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **IU X-ray Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Demner-Fushman, D., Kohli, M.D., Rosenman, M.B., Shooshan, S.E., Rodriguez, L., Antani, S., Thoma, G.R., McDonald, C.J. (2016). Preparing a collection of radiology examinations for distribution and retrieval. *Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association*, 23(2), 304â€“310.

- For the **MIMIC-CXR Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Johnson, A.E.W., Pollard, T.J., Greenbaum, N.R., Lungren, M.P., Deng, C.Y., Peng, Y., Lu, Z., Mark, R.G., Berkowitz, S.J., Horng, S. (2019). MIMIC-CXR-JPG, a large publicly available database of labeled chest radiographs. *arXiv preprint arXiv:1901.07042*.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations.
