To extract datasets from the research paper titled "NExT: Teaching Large Language Models to Reason about Code Execution" by Ansong Ni et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to find any references to datasets. In the abstract, the authors mention evaluating their method on two Python program repair benchmarks, which indicates that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors describe their evaluation methodology. They specifically mention two datasets:

1. **Mbp p - R**: This dataset is created from the original Mbpp dataset and consists of 10,047 repair tasks for training and 1,468 tasks for evaluation. The authors provide a brief description of how this dataset was constructed, indicating that it is a new repair benchmark.

2. **HumanEval Fix-Plus (HeFix+)**: This dataset is derived from the HumanEval dataset and consists of 164 buggy programs. The authors explain that they augmented this dataset with more rigorous test suites to create HeFix+.

I will now check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Mbp p - R**, the citation is:
  > Austin, J., Odena, A., Nye, M., Bosma, M., Michalewski, H., Dohan, D., Jiang, E., Cai, C., Terry, M., Le, Q., et al. *Program synthesis with large language models*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2108.07732, 2021.

- For **HumanEval Fix-Plus (HeFix+)**, the citation is:
  > Muennighoff, N., Liu, Q., Zebaze, A., Zheng, Q., Hui, B., Zhuo, T. Y., Singh, S., Tang, X., Von Werra, L., and Longpre, S. *OctoPack: Instruction tuning code large language models*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2308.07124, 2023.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
