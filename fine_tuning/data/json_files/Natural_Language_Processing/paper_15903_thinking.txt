To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-agent Attacks for Black-box Social Recommendations" by Shijie Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions "comprehensive experiments on various real-world datasets," which indicates that datasets are used, but I need to find their specific names.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experimental Settings)**, where the authors explicitly state the datasets used for evaluation. They mention three datasets:

1. **LastFM**: This dataset contains user-musician listening interactions from the Last.FM online music system.
2. **Ciao**: This dataset records user-item interactions in the context of product recommendations within its online community.
3. **Epinions**: This dataset also records user-item interactions in a social context.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **LastFM**, the citation is:
  > "LastFM dataset." Available at: http://millionsongdataset.com/lastfm/

- For **Ciao**, the citation is:
  > "Ciao dataset." Available at: https://www.cse.msu.edu/âˆ¼tangjili/datasetcode/ciao

- For **Epinions**, the citation is:
  > "Epinions dataset." Available at: http://www.trustlet.org/epinions.html

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use.

In summary, the datasets extracted from the paper are:
1. LastFM
2. Ciao
3. Epinions

Each dataset has been documented with its respective citation, ensuring that all necessary details are captured for future reference.
