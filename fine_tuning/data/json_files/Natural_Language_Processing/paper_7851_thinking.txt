To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Comparative Analysis of the Time and Energy Demand of Versatile Video Coding and High Efficiency Video Coding Reference Decoders" by Matthias Kränzler, Christian Herglotz, and André Kaup, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus, which may include mentions of datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **introduction**. The authors may describe the context of their research and reference any datasets that are relevant to their analysis of video codecs.

In the **methodology section**, I will pay close attention to any descriptions of the experimental setup, including the specific datasets used for testing the video codecs. This section often contains detailed information about the datasets, such as their characteristics, sizes, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

I will also check the **results section** for any tables or figures that summarize the findings related to the datasets. This may include performance metrics or comparisons that rely on the datasets.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets.

For example, if the authors reference a dataset like the "HM-16.20" or "VTM-7.0," I will ensure to include the full citation for these software references as they are essential for understanding the context of the experiments.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and ease of use.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets referenced in the paper, providing complete citations for each to maintain academic integrity.
