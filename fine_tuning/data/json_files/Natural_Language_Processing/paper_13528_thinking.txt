To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Separate and Locate: Rethink the Text in Text-based Visual Question Answering" by Chengyang Fang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on two benchmarks: **TextVQA** and **ST-VQA**. This indicates that these datasets are central to the research and should be included in my extraction.

Next, I will look into **section 4.1 (Datasets and Evaluation Metrics)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they describe:

1. **TextVQA**: This dataset is a subset of Open Images, annotated with 10 ground-truth answers for each scene-text-related question. It includes 28,408 images with 45,336 questions, and the authors mention the specific splits for training, validation, and testing.

2. **ST-VQA**: This dataset is similar to TextVQA and contains 23,038 images with 31,791 questions. The authors also detail the splits for this dataset, which are used for training, validation, and testing.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For **TextVQA**, the citation is:
> Amanpreet Singh, Vivek Natarajan, Meet Shah, Yu Jiang, Xinlei Chen, Dhruv Batra, Devi Parikh, and Marcus Rohrbach. *Towards VQA Models That Can Read*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 8317–8326, 2019.

For **ST-VQA**, the citation is:
> Ali Furkan Biten, Ruben Tito, Andres Mafla, Lluis Gomez, Marçal Rusinol, Ernest Valveny, CV Jawahar, and Dimosthenis Karatzas. *Scene Text Visual Question Answering*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 4291–4301, 2019.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or processing. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets referenced in the paper along with their proper citations.
