To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Evaluating the Utility of Model Explanations for Model Development" by Shawn Im et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiment setup sections** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's goals and methods, which may include references to datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experiment Setup)**, where the authors describe their methodology in detail. This section is likely to contain explicit mentions of the datasets used in their experiments. Here, I find that the authors mention using the **Visual Genome dataset** to curate custom datasets for their model training.

In **subsection 3.1 (Datasets)**, the authors detail the creation of two specific datasets:

1. **Baseline Dataset**: This dataset consists of 3,400 images with balanced positive and negative labels, where the positive class includes images of buses or trains, and the negative class contains images without these vehicles.

2. **Mislabeled Dataset**: This dataset also contains 3,400 images, but the positive class is entirely mislabeled, containing images of cars, vans, or trucks instead of buses or trains. The negative class includes images that contain no vehicles at all.

The authors provide a clear description of the datasets, including their sizes and the nature of the labels, which is crucial for understanding their experimental setup.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The Visual Genome dataset is cited as follows:

- For **Visual Genome Dataset**:
  > Ranjay Krishna, Yuke Zhu, Oliver Groth, Justin Johnson, Kenji Hata, Joshua Kravitz, Stephanie Chen, Yannis Kalantidis, Li-Jia Li, David A Shamma, et al. *Visual Genome: Connecting language and vision using crowdsourced dense image annotations*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 123:32â€“73, 2017.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use.

In summary, I have extracted the following datasets from the paper:

1. **Baseline Dataset**: 3,400 images with balanced labels (positive: buses/trains, negative: no vehicles).
2. **Mislabeled Dataset**: 3,400 images with mislabeled positive class (cars/vans/trucks) and negative class (no vehicles).

The full citation for the Visual Genome dataset is also noted for completeness. This structured approach ensures that I have accurately captured all relevant dataset information from the paper.
