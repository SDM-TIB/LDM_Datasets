To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Bilingual Adaptation of Monolingual Foundation Models" by Gurpreet Gosal et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on adapting monolingual models to other languages, which suggests that datasets are likely involved in the adaptation process.

Next, I will pay close attention to **section 2 (Pre-training Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for pre-training their models. Here, they mention two key datasets:

1. **AraV5 Arabic Dataset**: This dataset includes documents from various sources such as web pages, Wikipedia, Arabic news outlets, books, and social media. It also contains high-quality English corpora translated into Arabic. The dataset is curated by Sengupta et al. (2023b).

2. **Pile Corpus**: This dataset comprises data from 22 diverse sources, including ArXiv, Wikipedia, PubmedCentral, CommonCrawl, OpenWebText, and GitHub. The citation for this dataset is provided by Gao et al. (2020).

In the **results and methodology sections**, the authors discuss how they utilized these datasets for continual pre-training and the specific token counts used for different model adaptations. This reinforces the importance of the datasets mentioned.

Now, I will check the **References section** to retrieve the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **AraV5 Arabic Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Sengupta, N., Sahu, S. K., Jia, B., Katipomu, S., Li, H., Koto, F., Marshall, W., Gosal, G., Liu, C., Chen, Z., Afzal, O. M., Kamboj, S., Pandit, O., Pal, R., Pradhan, L., Mujahid, Z. M., Baali, M., Han, X., Bsharat, S. M., Aji, A. F., Shen, Z., Liu, Z., Vassilieva, N., Hestness, J., Hock, A., Feldman, A., Lee, J., Jackson, A., Ren, H. X., Nakov, P., Baldwin, T., and Xing, E. Jais and jais-chat: Arabic-centric foundation and instruction-tuned open generative large language models. 2023b.

- For the **Pile Corpus**, the citation is:
  > Gao, L., Biderman, S., Black, S., Golding, L., Hoppe, T., Foster, C., Phang, J., He, H., Thite, A., Nabeshima, N., Presser, S., and Leahy, C. The pile: An 800gb dataset of diverse text for language modeling. 2020.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will allow for a structured output that can be used for further analysis or integration into other systems.
