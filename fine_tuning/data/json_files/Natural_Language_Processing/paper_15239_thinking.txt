To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Interatomic Potentials at Multiple Scales" by Xiang Fu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for experiments. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets, which can help in identifying them.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors describe their experiments involving an **ab initio water system**. This is a clear indication that a dataset is being used, and I need to gather more details about it.

In the **experiments section**, the authors specify that the dataset consists of **1593 reference calculations of bulk liquid water** at the revPBE0-D3 level of accuracy. They also mention that each structure contains **192 atoms (64 water molecules)** and that they randomly sampled **1000 structures for training, 100 for validation, and the rest for testing**. This information is crucial for understanding the dataset's composition and usage.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The paper cites a reference for the ab initio water system, which is:

- **Ab initio water system**: 
  > Bingqing Cheng, Edgar A Engel, Jörg Behler, Christoph Dellago, and Michele Ceriotti. *Ab initio thermodynamics of liquid and solid water*. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 116(4):1110–1115, 2019.

With this information, I have successfully identified the dataset used in the paper and its full citation. 

Now, I will summarize the findings for the dataset:

1. **Dataset Name**: Ab initio water system
   - **Description**: Contains 1593 reference calculations of bulk liquid water at the revPBE0-D3 level of accuracy. Each structure consists of 192 atoms (64 water molecules). The authors randomly sampled 1000 structures for training, 100 for validation, and the rest for testing.
   - **Full Citation**: Bingqing Cheng, Edgar A Engel, Jörg Behler, Christoph Dellago, and Michele Ceriotti. *Ab initio thermodynamics of liquid and solid water*. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 116(4):1110–1115, 2019.

After compiling this information, I will prepare the dataset entry for further processing or review.
