To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Minimax Optimal Q Learning with Nearest Neighbors" by Puning Zhao and Lifeng Lai, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** of the paper. The abstract often provides a concise overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used in the study. In this case, the abstract does not explicitly mention any datasets, so I will proceed to the introduction.

In the **introduction**, I will look for any references to datasets that are used to validate the proposed methods. If the authors mention any datasets, I will note their names and any relevant details provided.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly any subsections that discuss experimental setup or datasets. This section is likely to contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used for training and evaluation. I will look for specific names, sizes, and characteristics of the datasets.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **experiments section** to confirm that the datasets mentioned in the methodology are indeed used in the experiments. This will help ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets relevant to the research.

Once I have identified the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily.

For example, if I find that the paper uses the "OpenAI Gym" dataset, I would look for the following citation:
> Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L., Schneider, J., & Schulman, J. (2016). *OpenAI Gym*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01583.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset entry includes its name, description, and full citation. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
