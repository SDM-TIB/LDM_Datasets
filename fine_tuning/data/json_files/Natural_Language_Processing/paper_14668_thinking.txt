To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Imitator Learning: Achieve Out-of-the-Box Imitation Ability in Variable Environments" by Xiong-Hui Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the development of a new navigation benchmark and a robot environment for imitator learning, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors describe their methodology and the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they mention a **demo-navigation benchmark** for ItorL, which is a navigation task under different complex mazes. This indicates that there is a specific dataset created for this purpose.

I will also look for any references to datasets in the **methodology** or **results sections**. The authors mention that they collected demonstrations for various tasks, including robot manipulation tasks, which implies that there are datasets associated with these tasks.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. The paper may reference other works that describe the datasets used, such as the navigation benchmark or robot manipulation environments.

1. **Demo-Navigation Benchmark**: This is a newly developed dataset for testing the imitator learning algorithm. The authors describe it as a navigation task under different complex mazes without global map information. However, the paper does not provide a specific citation for this dataset, as it is likely a novel contribution of the authors.

2. **Robot Manipulation Tasks**: The authors mention that they collected demonstrations for tasks such as object grasping, stacking, and collecting. While they describe the tasks in detail, they do not provide a specific dataset citation, indicating that these tasks may also be part of their original research.

Since the paper does not provide explicit citations for the datasets, I will summarize the datasets based on the information provided in the text:

- **Demo-Navigation Benchmark**: A dataset created for testing the imitator learning algorithm in navigation tasks within complex mazes.
- **Robot Manipulation Datasets**: Datasets created for tasks involving object grasping, stacking, and collecting, which are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed method.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for clarity and future reference. Since the paper does not provide full citations for the datasets, I will note that these datasets are original contributions of the authors and may not have formal citations yet.
