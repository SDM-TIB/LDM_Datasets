To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Non-contrastive sentence representations via self-supervision" by Marco Farina and Duccio Pappadopulo, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets along with their full citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions comparing self-supervised methods for learning text embeddings, which suggests that datasets may be involved in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors discuss various techniques and reference datasets like SNLI and MNLI. This indicates that these datasets are likely used in their experiments.

In the **methods section**, I will look for any explicit mention of datasets used for training or evaluation. The authors mention using the set of entailment pairs from SNLI and MNLI, as well as WikiAuto, which is a set of sentences from English Wikipedia aligned to their simplified English version. This confirms that these datasets are part of their methodology.

In the **results section**, I will verify if these datasets are referenced again, particularly in the context of performance metrics or comparisons. The authors discuss the performance of their models on various tasks, which may include results from the mentioned datasets.

Now, I will consult the **references section** to gather the full citations for each dataset:

1. **SNLI (Stanford Natural Language Inference)**:
   > Samuel R. Bowman, Gabor Angeli, Christopher Potts, and Christopher D. Manning. *A large annotated corpus for learning natural language inference*. In Proceedings of the 2015 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 632–642, Lisbon, Portugal. Association for Computational Linguistics.

2. **MNLI (Multi-Genre Natural Language Inference)**:
   > Nisan Stiennon, Long Ouyang, Jeffrey Wu, et al. *Learning to summarize with human feedback*. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 2020.

3. **WikiAuto**:
   > Chao Jiang, Mounica Maddela, Wuwei Lan, Yang Zhong, and Wei Xu. *Neural CRF model for sentence alignment in text simplification*. In Proceedings of the 58th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, pages 7943–7960, Online. Association for Computational Linguistics.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and includes its full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details or datasets mentioned in the paper.
