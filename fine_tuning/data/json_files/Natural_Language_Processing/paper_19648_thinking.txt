To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Substrate Scope Contrastive Learning: Repurposing Human Bias to Learn Atomic Representations" by Wenhao Gao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions a focus on **20,798 aryl halides in the CAS Content Collection**, which indicates a dataset is being utilized.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any additional context or details about the datasets. The introduction discusses the challenges of molecular representation learning and highlights the use of substrate scope tables, which suggests that these tables are a key component of the dataset.

In the **methods section**, I will look for specific details about how the dataset was constructed. The authors mention that they curated substrate scope tables from the CAS Content Collection, focusing on aryl halides and excluding those with fewer than five reactions. This leads to a total of **6,919 scopes with 64,192 reactions**. This information is crucial for understanding the dataset's composition.

I will also check the **results section** for any validation or application of the dataset. The authors discuss how the learned embeddings from the dataset can be applied to various tasks, reinforcing the importance of the dataset in their research.

Now, I will compile the full citations for the datasets mentioned in the paper. The primary dataset referenced is:

1. **CAS Content Collection**: This dataset includes **20,798 distinct aryl halides** and **64,192 reactions** across **6,919 substrate scopes**. The citation for this dataset is not explicitly provided in the paper, but it is referenced as a significant source of data for the study.

Since the CAS Content Collection is a well-known database, I will provide a general citation format for it:
> CAS Content Collection. *Chemical Abstracts Service*. Available at: https://www.cas.org/products/cas-content-collection.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets in a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly identified along with its citation. This will allow for easy reference and validation of the datasets used in the research.
