To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Theoretical Foundations of Deep Selective State-Space Models" by Nicola Muca Cirone et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract provides a high-level overview, and the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the datasets used in the research.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments or results sections**. This is where authors typically describe the datasets they used for training and evaluation, including details such as the number of samples, types of data, and any specific characteristics relevant to the study.

In this paper, I will specifically look for mentions of datasets like "toy datasets" or any specific datasets used for empirical validation. If the authors refer to any datasets, I will note their names and any relevant details provided.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

For example, if the authors mention a dataset like "the toy dataset introduced in Walker et al. (2024)," I will look up the full citation for that paper in the references to ensure I have the complete information.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset information in a structured format, ready for further processing or review.
