To extract datasets from the research paper titled "AI incidents and ‘networked trouble’: The case for a research agenda" by Tommy Shaffer Shane, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and main body of the paper** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract discusses AI incidents and their implications but does not explicitly mention any datasets. However, it does reference the AI Incident Database, which may be relevant.

Next, I will examine the **sections discussing examples of AI incidents**. The paper mentions various AI incidents, including a specific incident involving Twitter's cropping algorithm. I will look for any datasets that may have been used to analyze these incidents or that are referenced as part of the discussion.

In the **References section**, I will check for any citations that might indicate datasets or databases used in the research. The paper cites the AI Incident Database (2023), which is an important resource for understanding AI incidents. I will ensure to extract the full citation for this database.

The citation for the AI Incident Database is:
> AI Incident Database (2023). Available at: https://incidentdatabase.ai/.

Additionally, I will look for any other datasets mentioned throughout the paper, particularly in the context of analyzing AI incidents or algorithmic biases. However, the paper primarily focuses on theoretical discussions and does not provide specific datasets beyond the AI Incident Database.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets referenced in the paper.
