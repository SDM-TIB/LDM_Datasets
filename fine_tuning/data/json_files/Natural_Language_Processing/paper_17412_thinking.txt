To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Meta Transfer of Self-Supervised Knowledge: Foundation Model in Action for Post-Traumatic Epilepsy Prediction" by Wenhui Cui et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and datasets sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of foundation models and the challenges posed by the scarcity of clinical data, which suggests that datasets are likely discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used for building the foundation model. Here, I will look for specific names, descriptions, and any relevant details about the datasets.

The paper mentions several datasets:

1. **HCP dataset**: This dataset is derived from the Human Connectome Project and includes resting-state fMRI data from 1,096 young adults. The authors provide details about the preprocessing steps and the number of time points.

2. **ADHD-Peking dataset**: This dataset consists of data from the ADHD-200 consortium, specifically from the Peking site, which includes 245 subjects (102 ADHD and 143 Typically Developed Controls). The authors describe the preprocessing steps taken for this dataset.

3. **ABIDE-UM dataset**: This dataset is part of the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange and includes resting-state fMRI data from 66 subjects with Autism Spectrum Disorder and 74 Typically Developed Controls. The authors provide a link to where the data can be accessed.

4. **Maryland TBI MagNeTs dataset**: This dataset is used for downstream performance evaluation and includes fMRI data from subjects who suffered traumatic brain injuries. The authors mention the number of subjects and the context of data collection.

After identifying these datasets, I will then refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations I will extract are:

- For the **HCP dataset**:
  > Van Essen, D.C., Smith, S.M., Barch, D.M., Behrens, T.E., Yacoub, E., Ugurbil, K., Consortium, W.M.H. (2013). The Wu-Minn Human Connectome Project: An Overview. *Neuroimage*, 80, 62-79.

- For the **ADHD-Peking dataset**:
  > Bellec, P., Chu, C., Chouinard-Decorte, F., Benhajali, Y., Margulies, D.S., Craddock, R.C. (2017). The Neuro Bureau ADHD-200 Preprocessed Repository. *Neuroimage*, 144, 275-286.

- For the **ABIDE-UM dataset**:
  > Craddock, C., Benhajali, Y., Chu, C., Chouinard, F., Evans, A., Jakab, A., Khundrakpam, B.S., Lewis, J.D., Li, Q., Milham, M. (2013). The Neuro Bureau Preprocessing Initiative: Open Sharing of Preprocessed Neuroimaging Data and Derivatives. *Frontiers in Neuroinformatics*, 7, 5.

- For the **Maryland TBI MagNeTs dataset**:
  > Gullapalli, R.P. (2011). Investigation of Prognostic Ability of Novel Imaging Markers for Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI). Technical Report. Baltimore: University of Maryland.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
