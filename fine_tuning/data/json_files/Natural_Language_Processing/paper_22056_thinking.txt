To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Explainability of machine learning approaches in forensic linguistics: a case study in geolinguistic authorship profiling" by Dana Roemling et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on geolinguistic profiling using social media data, which suggests that a dataset is involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the use of social media data for forensic authorship profiling, specifically mentioning a corpus of German social media data from the platform Jodel. This indicates that the Jodel dataset is likely a key dataset for their analysis.

Next, I will examine the **data section** (section 3) where the authors describe the corpus in detail. They mention that the corpus consists of approximately 240 million tokens from about 8500 locations, collected by Hovy and Purschke (2018) and Purschke and Hovy (2019). This confirms that the Jodel dataset is indeed the primary dataset used in their research.

Now, I will look for the **full citation** of the dataset in the **references section**. The authors reference the original studies that collected the data:

- For the Jodel dataset, the citation is:
  > Dirk Hovy and Christoph Purschke. *Capturing regional variation with distributed place representations and geographic retrofitting*. In Proceedings of the 2018 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 4383–4394, Brussels, Belgium. Association for Computational Linguistics.

Additionally, they also reference another paper that utilized the dataset:
- For the work by Purschke and Hovy, the citation is:
  > Christoph Purschke and Dirk Hovy. *Lörres, möppes, and the swiss. (re)discovering regional patterns in anonymous social media data*. Journal of Linguistic Geography, 7(22):113–134.

Having identified the dataset and its citations, I will summarize the findings:

1. **Jodel Dataset**: A corpus of German social media data collected from the Jodel platform, consisting of approximately 240 million tokens from 8500 locations, used for geolinguistic profiling.

Now, I will compile the dataset entry with the full citation for the Jodel dataset, ensuring that it is ready for any structured output or further processing.
