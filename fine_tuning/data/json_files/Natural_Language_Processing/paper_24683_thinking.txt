To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Scalable Nested Optimization for Deep Learning" by Jonathan Peter Lorraine, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the text.

1. **Read the Abstract and Introduction**: I will start by examining the abstract and introduction sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract often summarizes the key contributions and may reference datasets used in the experiments.

2. **Identify Sections Related to Datasets**: I will look for sections that explicitly mention datasets, such as "Datasets," "Experiments," or "Methodology." These sections typically provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the research.

3. **Extract Dataset Information**: In the relevant sections, I will extract the names of the datasets, their descriptions, and any specific details provided by the authors, such as the number of samples, features, or any unique characteristics.

4. **Check for References**: After identifying the datasets, I will look at the references section of the paper to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets.

5. **Document Each Dataset**: For each dataset identified, I will compile the following information:
   - **Name of the Dataset**: The official name as mentioned in the paper.
   - **Description**: A brief overview of what the dataset contains and its purpose.
   - **Full Citation**: The complete reference for the dataset, including authors, title, publication venue, and year.

6. **Review for Completeness**: Finally, I will ensure that I have captured all datasets mentioned throughout the paper, including any that may have been referenced in the methodology or results sections.

By following these steps, I will create a comprehensive list of datasets used in the research, complete with necessary citations for each.
