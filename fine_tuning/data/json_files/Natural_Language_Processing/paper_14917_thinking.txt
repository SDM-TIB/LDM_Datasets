To extract datasets from the research paper titled "PAGE: Equilibrate Personalization and Generalization in Federated Learning" by Qian Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted extensive experiments on four widespread datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors mention using four datasets for their experiments: **Synthetic**, **Cifar-100**, **Tiny-ImageNet**, and **Shakespeare**. I will note down these names and look for descriptions or details about each dataset.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide a brief description of each dataset:

1. **Synthetic**: A multi-class logistic classification model with cross-entropy loss, where each client holds a specific number of training and testing samples.
2. **Cifar-100**: A dataset used with the ResNet-18 model, divided into 100 parts with a Dirichlet distribution for class ratios.
3. **Tiny-ImageNet**: Similar to Cifar-100, also used with ResNet-18, with the dataset divided into parts for local training and testing.
4. **Shakespeare**: A dataset where the role with more than 8000 sentences is selected as the client, with specific training and testing data allocations.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for these datasets. The paper does not provide explicit citations for the datasets, but I can infer the following based on common knowledge in the field:

- **Synthetic Dataset**: This is typically a custom dataset created for specific experiments, so it may not have a formal citation.
- **Cifar-100**: The citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky. 2009. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. 
- **Tiny-ImageNet**: The citation is:
  > Ya Le and Xuan Yang. 2015. *Tiny imagenet visual recognition challenge*. CS 231N Technical Report.
- **Shakespeare Dataset**: This dataset is often derived from the works of Shakespeare and may not have a formal citation, but it is commonly referenced in literature.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations where applicable. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
