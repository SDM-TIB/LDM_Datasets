To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Gaining More Insight into Neural Semantic Parsing with Challenging Benchmarks" by Xiao Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors discuss the Parallel Meaning Bank (PMB) and introduce new challenge sets, which suggests that datasets are central to their research.

In the **introduction**, the authors describe the PMB as a semantically annotated parallel corpus for multiple languages. They also mention the creation of two challenge sets, which indicates that these are new datasets introduced in the paper. I will note down the names and descriptions of these datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. The authors detail their systematic splitting approach and the creation of challenge sets, which include:

1. **Standard Test Set**: A systematic split of the PMB designed to improve the reliability of the evaluation.
2. **Long-Text Challenge Set**: This set includes 138 data samples with longer texts, aimed at assessing the parser's performance on more complex sentences.
3. **Compositional Challenge Set**: This set is created using Combinatory Categorical Grammar (CCG) to test compositional generalization.

I will also check the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The PMB is cited multiple times, and I will ensure to capture the most relevant citation for it. The citation for the PMB is:

- For the Parallel Meaning Bank (PMB):
  > Lasha Abzianidze, Rik van Noord, Chunliu Wang, and Johan Bos. *The Parallel Meaning Bank: A framework for semantically annotating multiple languages*. Applied Mathematics and Informatics, 25(2):45â€“60, 2020.

Additionally, I will note that the challenge sets are derived from the PMB, so they do not have separate citations but are part of the PMB's framework.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and that the full citations are included for reference. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research.
