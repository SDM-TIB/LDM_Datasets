To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Lifting Multi-View Detection and Tracking to the Bird’s Eye View" by Torben Teepe et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method on three public datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors typically provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used. Here, the authors mention three datasets:

1. **Wildtrack**: This dataset consists of real-world footage captured from seven synchronized and calibrated cameras in a public area. The authors provide specific details about the dataset, including the number of cameras, the area covered, the resolution, and the frame rate.

2. **MultiviewX**: This is a synthetic dataset modeled closely after Wildtrack, created using a game engine. The authors describe the number of cameras, the area covered, and the annotation details, which are crucial for understanding the dataset's structure.

3. **Synthehicle**: This dataset is synthetic and focuses on vehicle tracking in urban environments. The authors mention the conditions under which the data was collected and the types of vehicles included, which is important for contextualizing the dataset.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:

- For **Wildtrack**, the citation is:
  > Tatjana Chavdarova et al. *Wildtrack: A multi-camera HD dataset for dense unscripted pedestrian detection*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 5030–5039, 2018.

- For **MultiviewX**, the citation is:
  > Yunzhong Hou et al. *Multiview detection with feature perspective transformation*. In Proceedings of the European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), pages 1–18, 2020.

- For **Synthehicle**, the citation is:
  > Fabian Herzog et al. *Synthehicle: Multi-vehicle multi-camera tracking in virtual cities*. In Proceedings of the WACV Workshop, pages 1–11, 2023.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
