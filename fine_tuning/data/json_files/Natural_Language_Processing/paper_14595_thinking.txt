To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Federated Fine-Tuning of LLMs on the Very Edge: The Good, the Bad, the Ugly" by Herbert Woisetschläger et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a high-level overview, but I will need to look deeper into the methodology and experimental sections for specific dataset details.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) and the importance of data access. However, they do not mention specific datasets here.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors describe their methodology. Here, they mention that all FLAN-T5 models are fine-tuned on the **Samsum dataset**. This dataset is crucial for their experiments, and I will need to gather more details about it.

The **Samsum dataset** is described as a human-annotated dialogue dataset for abstractive summarization. The authors specify that they use this dataset to train their models with the objective of summarizing texts. 

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Samsum dataset. The relevant citation is:

- For the **Samsum dataset**:
  > Bogdan Gliwa, Iwona Mochol, Maciej Biesek, and Aleksander Wawer. *SAMSum corpus: A human-annotated dialogue dataset for abstractive summarization*. In Lu Wang, Jackie Chi Kit Cheung, Giuseppe Carenini, and Fei Liu, editors, Proceedings of the 2nd Workshop on New Frontiers in Summarization, pages 70–79, Hong Kong, China, November 2019. Association for Computational Linguistics. doi: 10.18653/v1/D19-5409. URL: https://aclanthology.org/D19-5409.

Having identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the findings:

1. **Samsum Dataset**: A human-annotated dialogue dataset used for summarization tasks, crucial for the experiments conducted in the paper.

Now, I will compile this information into a structured format that highlights the dataset and its citation, ensuring clarity and completeness for future reference or processing.
