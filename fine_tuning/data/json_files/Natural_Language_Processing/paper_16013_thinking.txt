To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MAP’s not dead yet: Uncovering true language model modes by conditioning away degeneracy" by Davis Yoshida et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses empirical verification of MAP decoding and mentions "exact modal sequences from these models," which suggests that datasets may be involved in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this paper, the authors mention using various models and datasets, including:

1. **WMT’17 Zh-En newsdev dataset**: This dataset is used for machine translation experiments. The authors state that they used source sentences from this dataset as inputs for their models.

2. **databricks-dolly-15k dataset**: This dataset is mentioned in the context of instruction-following experiments with the LLaMA model. The authors filtered this dataset to include instructions that are less than 256 tokens long.

3. **ROC Stories dataset**: This dataset is used for finetuning the GPT-2 model, which is mentioned in the context of story completion experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **WMT’17 Zh-En newsdev dataset**, the citation is:
  > Ondřej Bojar, Yvette Graham, and Amir Kamran. *Results of the WMT17 metrics shared task*. In Proceedings of the Second Conference on Machine Translation, pages 489–513, Copenhagen, Denmark, 2017.

- For the **databricks-dolly-15k dataset**, the citation is:
  > Mike Conover, Matt Hayes, Ankit Mathur, Jianwei Xie, Jun Wan, Sam Shah, Ali Ghodsi, Patrick Wendell, Matei Zaharia, and Reynold Xin. *Free dolly: Introducing the world’s first truly open instruction-tuned llm*. 2023.

- For the **ROC Stories dataset**, the citation is:
  > Nasrin Mostafazadeh, Nathanael Chambers, Xiaodong He, Devi Parikh, Dhruv Batra, Lucy Vanderwende, Pushmeet Kohli, and James Allen. *A corpus and cloze evaluation for deeper understanding of commonsense stories*. In Proceedings of the 2016 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, pages 839–849, 2016.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
