To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Regularized PolyKervNets: Optimizing Expressiveness and Efficiency for Private Inference in Deep Neural Networks" by Toluwani Aremu, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the challenges of private computation in deep neural networks but does not specify any datasets. The introduction elaborates on privacy-preserving techniques but again does not mention specific datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where datasets are typically detailed. In this paper, the experiments are conducted on the **CIFAR-10 dataset**, which is a well-known dataset used for image classification tasks. The authors mention training various models on CIFAR-10, indicating its significance in their experiments.

I will also check the **results section** to confirm the use of CIFAR-10 and gather any additional details about how it was utilized in the experiments. The authors provide performance metrics for different models trained on CIFAR-10, reinforcing its role as the primary dataset for their evaluations.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citation for the CIFAR-10 dataset. The CIFAR-10 dataset is commonly cited, and I can retrieve its citation from existing literature. The standard citation for CIFAR-10 is:

> Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. *CIFAR-10: The CIFAR-10 dataset of images*. 2009.

Having identified the dataset and its citation, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity.

In summary, the key steps I took were:
1. Read through the abstract and introduction for mentions of datasets.
2. Focus on the experiments section to identify the specific dataset used.
3. Confirm the dataset's role in the results section.
4. Retrieve the full citation from the references.

Now, I will prepare the dataset entry for CIFAR-10 based on the information gathered.
