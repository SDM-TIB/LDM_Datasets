To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Reinforcement Learning of Adaptive Acquisition Policies for Inverse Problems" by Gianluigi Silvestri et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors evaluate their approach on multiple datasets, which indicates that there are specific datasets to look for.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section. Here, the authors discuss the context of their work and may mention specific datasets used in their experiments. I will look for any explicit names or descriptions of datasets.

Then, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets and Sensing Operations)**, as this section is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets used in the experiments. The authors mention two datasets:

1. **MNIST Dataset**: This dataset is widely known and consists of handwritten digit images. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Deng, L. (2012). The MNIST database of handwritten digit images for machine learning research. *IEEE Signal Processing Magazine*, 29(6), 141-142.

2. **Low Dose CT Image and Projection Data (MAYO) Dataset**: This dataset is used for medical imaging and is referenced in the paper. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Moen, T. R., Chen, B., Holmes III, D. R., Duan, X., Yu, Z., Yu, L., Leng, S., Fletcher, J. G., & McCollough, C. H. (2021). Low-dose CT image and projection dataset. *Medical Physics*, 48(2), 902-911.

After identifying these datasets, I will verify their usage in the **experiments section** to confirm that they were indeed utilized in the authors' evaluations.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information along with their citations to ensure that I have a complete and accurate record of the datasets referenced in the paper. This structured approach will help me extract the necessary information effectively and ensure that I provide the correct citations for each dataset.
