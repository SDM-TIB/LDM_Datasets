To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Prominent Roles of Conditionally Invariant Components in Domain Adaptation: Theory and Algorithms" by Keru Wu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

1. **Read the Abstract and Introduction**: I will start by examining the abstract and introduction sections to get an overview of the research focus and any datasets that may be mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors support their findings with numerical experiments on various datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

2. **Identify Sections on Datasets**: I will look for sections explicitly discussing datasets, typically labeled as "Datasets," "Experiments," or similar. In this paper, I will focus on sections that detail the experiments conducted, as they often include the datasets used.

3. **Locate Dataset Descriptions**: In the relevant sections, I will look for specific mentions of datasets. The authors may describe datasets like MNIST, CelebA, Camelyon17, and DomainNet, as indicated in the paper. I will note the context in which each dataset is used, including any specific characteristics or modifications made for the experiments.

4. **Extract Dataset Information**: For each identified dataset, I will extract the following information:
   - **Name of the Dataset**: The official name of the dataset as mentioned in the paper.
   - **Description**: A brief description of the dataset, including its purpose, size, and any relevant details about the data collection process.
   - **Citation**: I will check the references section of the paper to find the full citation for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

5. **Compile the Information**: After gathering the necessary information for each dataset, I will compile it into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and citation.

6. **Review for Completeness**: Finally, I will review the extracted information to ensure that all relevant datasets mentioned in the paper are included and that the citations are accurate.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets used in the research paper, providing a clear reference for future readers and researchers.
