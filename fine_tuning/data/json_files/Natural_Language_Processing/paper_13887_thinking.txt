To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Data-Driven Goal Recognition in Transhumeral Prostheses Using Process Mining Techniques" by Zihang Su et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study involves data collected from ten subjects in a virtual reality setting, which suggests that a dataset is indeed present.

Next, I will focus on the **Methods of Data Collection section**. Here, the authors describe the dataset in detail, mentioning that it includes data from ten healthy subjects performing forward-reaching tasks. They specify that the dataset contains **35 surface electromyography (sEMG) features and 12 joint kinematic movement features**, which are crucial for understanding the dataset's structure.

In this section, the authors also mention that the data was collected at a rate of **10 Hz** and that the subjects performed tasks involving three different elbow poses (goals). This information is essential for describing the dataset's characteristics.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The authors refer to their previous work for the data collection methods, which is likely where the dataset is originally described. The relevant citation is:

- For the dataset used in this study, the citation is:

Now, I will summarize the dataset details:

1. **Dataset Name**: Transhumeral Prosthesis Dataset
   - **Description**: This dataset includes time series data from surface electromyography electrodes and kinematic sensors collected from ten healthy subjects performing forward-reaching tasks. It contains 35 sEMG features and 12 joint kinematic movement features, sampled at a rate of 10 Hz.
   - **Usage**: The dataset is used to train and evaluate a goal recognition system for transhumeral prostheses.

With this information, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring that I include the full citation as required. This structured approach will help ensure that I accurately capture all necessary details about the dataset from the research paper.
