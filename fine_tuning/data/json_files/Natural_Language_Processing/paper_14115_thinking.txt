To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Quasi-Monte Carlo for 3D Sliced Wasserstein" by Khai Nguyen, Nicola Bariletto, and Nhat Ho, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for experiments. In this case, the authors discuss experiments on various 3D tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4) to identify specific datasets used in the evaluations. The authors mention using point-clouds from the **ShapeNet Core-55 dataset** for their experiments on point-cloud comparison, interpolation, and training deep point-cloud autoencoders. This is a clear indication of a dataset being utilized.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the ShapeNet dataset. The citation for the ShapeNet dataset is as follows:
> Panos Achlioptas, Olga Diamanti, Ioannis Mitliagkas, and Leonidas Guibas. *Learning representations and generative models for 3D point clouds*. In International conference on machine learning, pp. 40â€“49. PMLR, 2018.

Additionally, I will look for any other datasets mentioned throughout the paper. However, the primary dataset referenced for the experiments appears to be the ShapeNet dataset.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring to include the full citation for the ShapeNet dataset, as it is crucial for proper documentation.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry in the required format, ready for further processing or review.
