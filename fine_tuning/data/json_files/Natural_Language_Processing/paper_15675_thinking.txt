To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Statistics of C. elegans turning behavior reveals optimality under biasing constraints" by W. Mathijs Rozemuller et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the research, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will examine the **methods** section, as it typically contains detailed descriptions of the experimental setup, including any datasets used for analysis. In this case, the authors describe their behavioral experiments with C. elegans, including the tracking of worm movements and the conditions under which the data were collected.

I will also look for a dedicated **results** or **datasets** section, where the authors may summarize the datasets used in their analyses. This section often provides specific details about the datasets, such as the number of samples, types of measurements, and any relevant statistical analyses performed.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references** section to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and for readers who may want to access the original sources of the datasets.

For this paper, I anticipate that the following datasets will be relevant:

1. **C. elegans turning behavior dataset**: This dataset includes the recorded trajectories of C. elegans during exploration and escape behaviors, detailing the sharp and gradual turns made by the worms.

2. **Escape response dataset**: This dataset captures the specific turning behaviors of C. elegans when encountering a repellent boundary, including the types of turns (ventral omega, ventral delta, dorsal omega) and their probabilities based on the angle of approach.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the full citations for each dataset, ensuring that they are formatted correctly according to the citation style used in the paper.

Finally, I will summarize the findings in a structured format, highlighting the key characteristics of each dataset, including the context of its use, the types of measurements taken, and any relevant statistical findings. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research.
