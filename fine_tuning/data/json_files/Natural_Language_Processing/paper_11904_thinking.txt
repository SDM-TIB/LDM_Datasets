To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Obvious Manipulations in Matching with and without Contracts" by R. Pablo Arribillaga and Eliana Pepa Risma, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract does not explicitly mention any datasets, but it does discuss the context of matching models, which may imply the use of data for simulations or experiments.

Next, I will examine the **main results** and **experiments** sections of the paper. However, this paper appears to be more theoretical in nature, focusing on proofs and theorems rather than empirical results based on specific datasets. Therefore, I will look for any references to datasets used in previous works cited in the paper.

I will check the **References section** for any papers that might have utilized datasets relevant to the matching models discussed. The references include works by authors like Troyan and Morrill, Hatfield and Milgrom, and Roth, which may have associated datasets.

After reviewing the references, I will note any datasets mentioned in those papers. For instance, if a referenced paper discusses a specific dataset used for matching experiments, I will extract that information.

If I find any datasets, I will ensure to write down their full citations as they appear in the references. This is crucial for proper attribution and for anyone who may want to access the datasets for their own research.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, into a structured format for clarity and ease of use.

In summary, my steps will be:
1. Read the abstract and introduction for any dataset mentions.
2. Review the main results and experiments sections for empirical data.
3. Check the references for any datasets used in cited works.
4. Note down the full citations for any identified datasets.
5. Compile the information in a clear format for future reference.
