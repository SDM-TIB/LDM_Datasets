To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Using Holographically Compressed Embeddings in Question Answering" by Salvador E. Barbosa, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. In the abstract, the author discusses the use of embeddings in question answering, but I need to look for specific datasets.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the author describes the experimental setup. Here, the author mentions the use of the **SQuAD 1.1 dataset** for training and validation. This dataset is crucial for the experiments conducted in the paper.

In section 4.1, the author provides details about the **SQuAD 1.1 dataset**, stating that it consists of over 87,000 questions and 10,000 validation questions, with answers extractable from the passages. This confirms that the SQuAD dataset is indeed used in the experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the SQuAD dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Rajpurkar, P., Zhang, J., Lopyrev, K., and Liang, P. (2016). "SQuAD: 100,000+ questions for machine comprehension of text." arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.05250.

Since the paper primarily focuses on the SQuAD dataset for its experiments, I will document this dataset accordingly.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring that I include the full citation as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive reference for the dataset used in the research.
