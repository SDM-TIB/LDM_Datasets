To extract datasets from the research paper titled "COSA: Concatenated Sample Pretrained Vision-Language Foundation Model" by Sihan Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that COSA improves performance across various downstream tasks, which suggests that multiple datasets may be involved in the evaluation of the model.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for training and evaluation. In this paper, the authors mention several benchmarks in the context of their experiments, specifically in **section 4 (Experiments)**. 

I will identify the datasets mentioned in the following subsections:

1. **4.1 Implementation Details**: Here, the authors provide details about the datasets used for training and evaluation. They mention datasets like **MSRVTT**, **MSVD**, **LSMDC**, **DiDeMo**, **VATEX**, **YouCook2**, **ActivityNet Caption**, **TVC**, **MSCOCO**, and **Flickr30K**.

2. **4.2 Comparison to State-of-the-Art**: This section discusses the performance of COSA on various benchmarks, confirming the use of the aforementioned datasets.

3. **Appendix B (Downstream Dataset Descriptions)**: This section provides detailed descriptions of each dataset, including the number of videos, captions, and specific tasks associated with each dataset.

Now, I will compile the datasets along with their full citations from the references section of the paper. Here are the datasets identified:

After gathering this information, I will ensure that the dataset entries are formatted correctly for any required output or further processing.
