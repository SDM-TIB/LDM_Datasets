To extract the datasets mentioned in the paper titled "SEQ2SEQ-SC: End-to-End Semantic Communication Systems with Pre-Trained Language Model" by Ju-Hyung Lee et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a high-level overview, but the experiments section is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets used.

In the **experiments section (IV)**, the authors mention three datasets:

1. **European Parliament Dataset**: This dataset consists of 2 million sentences and is used for model training. The authors state that they let the input and output be the same for each sentence (i.e., s → s).

2. **Natural Language Inference Data**: This dataset contains 270,000 pairs of entailment relationships, where the output is different from the input but retains the same semantic meaning (i.e., s → s′).

3. **Flickr Dataset**: The authors use a random sample of 1,000 sentences from this dataset to evaluate the model's generalizability and superiority. 

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **European Parliament Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Philipp Koehn, “Europarl: A parallel corpus for statistical machine translation,” in Proc. Machine Translation Summit X: Papers, Phuket, Thailand, Sept. 13-15 2005, pp. 79–86.

- For the **Natural Language Inference Data**, the citation is:
  > Samuel R. Bowman, Gabor Angeli, Christopher Potts, and Christopher D. Manning, “A large annotated corpus for learning natural language inference,” in Proc. the Conf. on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), 2015.

- For the **Flickr Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Peter Young, Alice Lai, Micah Hodosh, and Julia Hockenmaier, “From image descriptions to visual denotations: New similarity metrics for semantic inference over event descriptions,” Trans. of the Association for Computational Linguistics, vol. 2, pp. 67–78, 2014.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
