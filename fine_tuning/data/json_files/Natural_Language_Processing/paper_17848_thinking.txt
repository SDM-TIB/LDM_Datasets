To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DCR: Divide-and-Conquer Reasoning for Multi-choice Question Answering with LLMs" by Zijie Meng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the datasets referenced. The abstract mentions that the experiments were conducted across **nine datasets**, which indicates that multiple datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 3) where the authors detail the datasets used for evaluation. In **Section 3.1 (Datasets and evaluation metrics)**, the authors explicitly list the datasets used in their experiments:

1. **AQuA (AQ.)**: This dataset is used for arithmetic tasks and consists of 254 test items.
2. **Abstract Algebra (Alg.)**: Another arithmetic dataset with 100 test items.
3. **High School Mathematics (Math.)**: This dataset also focuses on arithmetic and contains 270 test items.
4. **CMSQA (CMS.)**: A commonsense reasoning dataset with 1221 test items.
5. **OpenBookQA (OB.)**: This commonsense dataset has 500 test items.
6. **ARC Challenge (ARC.)**: Another commonsense dataset with 1165 test items.
7. **RiddleSense (Rid.)**: A logic reasoning dataset containing 1021 test items.
8. **Logical Deduction (Logi.)**: This dataset is used for logic tasks and has 300 validation items.
9. **Reclor (Rec.)**: Another logic reasoning dataset with 500 test items.
10. **GSM8K**: A cloze-style dataset of grade school math questions, which was adapted into a multiple-choice format for the experiments.
11. **SVAMP**: Another arithmetic dataset used in the experiments.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. Here are the citations I will include:

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented and properly cited for future reference.
