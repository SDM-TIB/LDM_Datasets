To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Reverse Kron Reduction of Multi-phase Radial Network" by Steven H. Low, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the work, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will examine the **methodology** and **experiments** sections, as these typically contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used for analysis. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics. If the authors refer to datasets in the context of their experiments or results, I will take note of those references.

I will also check the **references section** of the paper for any citations that may correspond to datasets. This section often contains full citations for datasets that are used or referenced in the research. If a dataset is mentioned in the text but not fully cited, I will look for the original source in the references.

As I identify datasets, I will ensure to document the following information for each dataset:
1. **Name of the dataset**: The title or commonly used name of the dataset.
2. **Description**: A brief description of the dataset, including its purpose and any relevant details (e.g., number of samples, features).
3. **Full citation**: The complete reference for the dataset, including authors, title, publication venue, and year.

For example, if I find a dataset named "XYZ Dataset" used in the experiments, I will note:
- **Name**: XYZ Dataset
- **Description**: A dataset containing 1,000 samples of three-phase power measurements for network identification.
- **Full citation**: Author(s). *Title of the dataset*. Publisher/Journal, Year.

After gathering all relevant datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly presents each dataset along with its details and citations.

Finally, I will ensure that all extracted information is accurate and properly formatted, ready for inclusion in any subsequent analysis or reporting.
