To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "FMamba: Mamba based on Fast-attention for Multivariate Time-series Forecasting" by Shusen Ma et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on **eight public datasets**, which suggests that I should look for a detailed list of these datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental results section**, where the authors provide a table (Table 1) that lists the datasets used in their experiments. The table includes the following datasets:

1. **PEMS03**: Contains California's public traffic network data, collected in 5-minute intervals.
2. **PEMS04**: Another dataset from California's public traffic network, also collected in 5-minute intervals.
3. **PEMS07**: Similar to the previous datasets, this one also contains traffic data collected in 5-minute intervals.
4. **PEMS08**: Yet another dataset from California's traffic network, collected in 5-minute intervals.
5. **Electricity**: This dataset includes hourly data on electricity consumption from 321 clients.
6. **SML2010**: Data collected from 22 sensors in a room over about 40 days, with an average sampling time of 15 minutes.
7. **Weather**: This dataset includes 21 meteorological variables recorded every 10 minutes at a weather station.
8. **Solar-Energy**: Records solar power production from 137 photovoltaic plants in 2006, sampled every 10 minutes.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. However, the paper does not provide specific citations for these datasets, as they are commonly used public datasets in the field of time-series forecasting. Therefore, I will provide general references for these datasets based on common knowledge:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their general references, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
