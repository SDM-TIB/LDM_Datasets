To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Development and Deployment of a Big Data Pipeline for Field-based High-throughput Cotton Phenotyping Data" by Amanda Issac et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the evaluation of a pipeline using a dataset of **9,000 images** for cotton bloom detection. This indicates that a dataset is present, but I need to find more details about it.

Next, I will look into **section 2 (Dataset)**, where the authors describe the dataset in detail. Here, they mention that the dataset consists of images collected from a cotton research farm using a stereo camera mounted on an autonomous rover. They specify that a total of **9,018 images** were collected over several days in 2021, which is crucial information for the dataset entry.

In **subsection 2.1 (Cotton Research Farm)**, the authors provide context about the data collection site, which is the University of Georgia’s Tifton campus. This information is relevant for understanding the dataset's origin.

In **subsection 2.2 (Cotton Field Data Collection)**, they describe the equipment used for data collection, including the specifications of the stereo camera and the rover. This technical detail adds depth to the dataset description.

In **subsection 2.3 (Dataset Creation)**, the authors explain how the images were processed and labeled, resulting in a total of **1,530 frames** from the original video streams. This information is essential for understanding the dataset's structure.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The authors do not provide a specific citation for the dataset itself, as it appears to be their own collection. However, I can note that the dataset is part of their research and can be referenced as follows:

- **Cotton Field Dataset**: This dataset consists of 9,018 images collected from a cotton research farm at the University of Georgia’s Tifton campus, captured using a stereo camera mounted on an autonomous rover.

Since the dataset is not published in a separate paper, I will create a citation entry that reflects its origin within the context of this research paper.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the dataset as part of the description. This will allow for proper attribution and clarity in future references to this dataset.
