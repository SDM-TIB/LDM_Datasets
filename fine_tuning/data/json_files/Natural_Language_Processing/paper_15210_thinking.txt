To extract datasets from the research paper titled "F2AT: Feature-Focusing Adversarial Training via Disentanglement of Natural and Perturbed Patterns" by Yaguan Qian et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the effectiveness of the proposed method, but it does not specify any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section V) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention that they conducted experiments on **CIFAR-10** and **CIFAR-100** datasets. This is a clear indication that these datasets are relevant to the research.

I will also check the **related works section** and **conclusion** to see if there are any additional datasets mentioned or referenced. However, it appears that CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 are the primary datasets used throughout the paper.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets are well-known datasets in the machine learning community, and their citations are as follows:

- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009.

- For **CIFAR-100**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009.

Since both datasets are from the same source, I will ensure to note that in the dataset entries.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
