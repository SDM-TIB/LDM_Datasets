To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Media Forensics and Deepfake - Systematic Survey" by Nadeem Jabbar et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract discusses the use of Deepfake datasets for training and testing models, which indicates that datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **Public Datasets section (Section 4)**, as it is likely to contain the specific datasets used in the research. In this section, the authors provide a comprehensive list of both real and fake datasets used for Deepfake detection. I will carefully note each dataset mentioned, along with any relevant details provided.

The datasets identified in the paper include:

1. **CelebA**: This dataset consists of labeled images of celebrity faces, totaling 200,000 images across 10,000 celebrities, with annotations for facial attributes.
