To extract datasets from the research paper titled "RAG-based Explainable Prediction of Road Users' Behaviors for Automated Driving using Knowledge Graphs and Large Language Models" by Mohamed Manzour Hussien et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors implemented two use cases: pedestrian crossing actions and lane change maneuvers, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **Section II (Modeling Road User’s Behaviors Using Knowledge Graphs)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. They mention two datasets for the pedestrian use case:

1. **Joint Attention for Autonomous Driving (JAAD)**: This dataset consists of 348 short video clips, each annotated with various road actors and scenarios across different driving conditions. The annotations include spatial, behavioral, contextual, and pedestrian information.

2. **Pedestrian Situated Intent (PSI)**: This dataset includes 104 training videos, 34 validation videos, and 48 testing videos, covering 196 scenes. It contains bounding box annotations for traffic objects and agents, along with text descriptions and reasoning explanations.

For the lane change prediction use case, the authors refer to the **HighD dataset**, which is a collection of naturalistic vehicle trajectories recorded using a drone on German highways.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **JAAD dataset**, the citation is:

- For the **PSI dataset**, the citation is:

- For the **HighD dataset**, the citation is:

Eckstein. *The HighD Dataset: A Drone Dataset of Naturalistic Vehicle Trajectories on German Highways for Validation of Highly Automated Driving Systems*.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
