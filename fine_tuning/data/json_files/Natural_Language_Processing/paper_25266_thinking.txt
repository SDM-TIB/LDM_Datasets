To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Scale-Aware Full Surround Monodepth with Transformers" by Yuchen Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. In the abstract, the authors mention that their experiments are conducted on two public datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed present. I will note this down as a starting point.

Next, I will look into **section 4.1 (Experimental Settings)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention:

1. **DDAD Dataset**: This dataset is described as containing 12,650 training samples and 3,950 validation samples, each with frames from 6 camera views. It is collected in urban settings across cities in the US and Japan.

2. **nuScenes Dataset**: This dataset consists of 1,000 sequences of videos, with 700 for training, 150 for validation, and 150 for testing. It is collected in Boston and Singapore.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For the **DDAD Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Vitor Guizilini, Rares Ambrus, Sudeep Pillai, Allan Raventos, and Adrien Gaidon. *3D Packing for Self-Supervised Monocular Depth Estimation*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 2485–2494, 2020.

- For the **nuScenes Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Holger Caesar, Varun Bankiti, Alex H Lang, Sourabh Vora, Venice Erin Liong, Qiang Xu, Anush Krishnan, Yu Pan, Giancarlo Baldan, and Oscar Beijbom. *nuScenes: A Multimodal Dataset for Autonomous Driving*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 11621–11631, 2020.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations.
