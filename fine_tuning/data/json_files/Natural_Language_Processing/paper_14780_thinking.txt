To extract datasets from the research paper titled "OpsEval: A Comprehensive Benchmark Suite for Evaluating Large Language Models’ Capability in IT Operations Domain" by Yuhe Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the paper introduces a benchmark suite called **OpsEval**, which includes an evaluation dataset. This suggests that there is a dataset to extract.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **methodology section**. The authors describe the dataset as containing **7,184 multiple-choice questions and 1,736 QA questions**. They also mention that **20% of the dataset has been released under a CC-BY-NC-4.0 license**, which is crucial information for citation.

In the **results and discussion sections**, the authors elaborate on the dataset's structure and its purpose in evaluating large language models (LLMs) in the IT operations domain. They emphasize that the dataset is designed to assist researchers in preliminary evaluations of their LLMs tailored for Ops.

Now, I will check the **References section** for full citations related to the dataset. The paper does not provide a separate citation for the dataset itself, but it does mention that the dataset is available on GitHub, which can be cited as follows:

- For the **OpsEval dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yuhe Liu, Changhua Pei, Longlong Xu, Bohan Chen, Mingze Sun, Zhirui Zhang, Yongqian Sun, Shenglin Zhang, Kun Wang, Haiming Zhang, Jianhui Li, Gaogang Xie, Xidao Wen, Xiaohui Nie, Minghua Ma, Dan Pei. *OpsEval: A Comprehensive Benchmark Suite for Evaluating Large Language Models’ Capability in IT Operations Domain*. Available at: https://github.com/NetManAIOps/OpsEval-Datasets.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This includes ensuring that the dataset's name, description, and citation are clearly presented.
