To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Challenges and Opportunities for Second-life Batteries: A Review of Key Technologies and Economy" by Xubo Gu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections that discuss methodologies and experiments** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a general overview, but I will focus on the introduction and subsequent sections for specific references to datasets.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the increasing volume of electric vehicles (EVs) and the implications for retired lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). They mention the need for data-driven approaches to assess the performance and economic viability of second-life batteries, which suggests that datasets may be referenced later in the paper.

Next, I will examine **section 2 (Degradation Model)**, where the authors discuss various degradation models and may reference datasets used for their analyses. I will look for any specific datasets mentioned in the context of battery degradation studies.

In **section 4 (Economic Analysis)**, the authors review the economic benefits of second-life batteries and may reference datasets related to economic assessments or case studies. This section is likely to contain valuable information about datasets used in their analyses.

After identifying potential datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. The authors may refer to existing datasets from other studies, and I will ensure to capture the complete citation format.

For example, if the authors mention datasets such as the NASA battery datasets or CALCE datasets, I will locate the full citations for these datasets in the references. 

Once I have gathered all the relevant datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset, its description, and the corresponding citation.

In summary, my steps will be:
1. Read the abstract, introduction, and relevant sections (especially sections discussing methodologies and economic analyses).
2. Identify any datasets mentioned explicitly in the text.
3. Check the References section for full citations of these datasets.
4. Compile the dataset information, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets referenced in the paper, along with their proper citations.
