To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Context-Aware Answer Extraction in Question Answering" by Yeon Seonwoo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments using several datasets, which suggests that I should find specific names and details.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention:

1. **SQuAD1.1**: This is a well-known reading comprehension dataset for question answering. The authors note that they split the training data into new train/dev datasets for their experiments.

2. **NewsQA**: This dataset consists of answer spans to questions generated from news articles, reflecting realistic information-seeking processes.

3. **NaturalQuestions**: This dataset is a QA benchmark that uses Google search queries for naturally occurring questions and passages from Wikipedia.

4. **HotpotQA**: This dataset is designed to measure complex reasoning performance in QA models, requiring the identification of relevant supporting sentences from given passages.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **SQuAD1.1**, the citation is:
  > Pranav Rajpurkar, Jian Zhang, Konstantin Lopyrev, and Percy Liang. *SQuAD: 100,000+ questions for machine comprehension of text*. In EMNLP, 2016.

- For **NewsQA**, the citation is:
  > Adam Trischler, Tong Wang, Xingdi Yuan, Justin Harris, Alessandro Sordoni, Philip Bachman, and Kaheer Suleman. *NewsQA: A machine comprehension dataset*. In Proceedings of the 2nd Workshop on Representation Learning for NLP, pages 191–200, 2017.

- For **NaturalQuestions**, the citation is:
  > Tom Kwiatkowski, Jennimaria Palomaki, Olivia Redfield, Michael Collins, Ankur Parikh, Chris Alberti, Danielle Epstein, Illia Polosukhin, Jacob Devlin, Kenton Lee, et al. *Natural Questions: A benchmark for question answering research*. Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics, 7:453–466, 2019.

- For **HotpotQA**, the citation is:
  > Zhilin Yang, Peng Qi, Saizheng Zhang, Yoshua Bengio, William Cohen, Ruslan Salakhutdinov, and Christopher D. Manning. *HotpotQA: A dataset for diverse, explainable multi-hop question answering*. In EMNLP, 2018.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or processing.
