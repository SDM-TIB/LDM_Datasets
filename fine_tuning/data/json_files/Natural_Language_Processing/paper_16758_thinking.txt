To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Large Language Models on Graphs: A Comprehensive Survey" by Bowen Jin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the paper summarizes "open-source codes and benchmark datasets," which indicates that datasets are likely discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets**. In this paper, there are references to datasets in **Section 7 (Applications)**, where the authors summarize datasets for three scenarios: pure graphs, text-attributed graphs, and text-paired graphs. I will carefully read through this section to identify specific datasets mentioned.

In **Table 2**, which summarizes datasets for text-attributed graphs, I will note the following datasets:

1. **ogb-arxiv**: This dataset is used for node classification tasks and contains academic papers from the arXiv repository.
   - Citation: > Hu, W., Fey, M., Zitnik, M., Dong, Y., Ren, H., Liu, B., & Leskovec, J. (2020). Open Graph Benchmark: Datasets for Machine Learning on Graphs. In NeurIPS.

2. **ogb-products**: This dataset is also for node classification and consists of product data from an e-commerce platform.
   - Citation: > Hu, W., Fey, M., Zitnik, M., Dong, Y., Ren, H., Liu, B., & Leskovec, J. (2020). Open Graph Benchmark: Datasets for Machine Learning on Graphs. In NeurIPS.

3. **Cora**: A well-known dataset for citation networks, used for node classification.
   - Citation: > McCallum, A.K., Nigam, K., Rennie, J., & Seymore, K. (2000). Automating the Construction of Internet Portals with Machine Learning. In Information Retrieval.

4. **Citeseer**: Another citation network dataset used for node classification.
   - Citation: > Giles, C.L., Bollacker, K.D., & Lawrence, S. (1998). CiteSeer: An Automatic Citation Indexing System. In Proceedings of the Third ACM Conference on Digital Libraries.

5. **DBLP**: A dataset containing bibliographic information on computer science publications.
   - Citation: > Wang, K., Shen, Z., Huang, C., Wu, C.H., Dong, Y., & Kanakia, A. (2020). Microsoft Academic Graph: When Experts Are Not Enough. In Quantitative Science Studies.

6. **MAG**: The Microsoft Academic Graph, which includes a wide range of academic publications.
   - Citation: > Wang, K., Shen, Z., Huang, C., Wu, C.H., Dong, Y., & Kanakia, A. (2020). Microsoft Academic Graph: When Experts Are Not Enough. In Quantitative Science Studies.

7. **Goodreads-books**: A dataset for book recommendations based on user reviews.
   - Citation: > Ni, J., Li, J., & McAuley, J. (2019). Justifying Recommendations Using Distantly-Labeled Reviews and Fine-Grained Aspects. In EMNLP-IJCNLP.

8. **Amazon-items**: A dataset for product recommendations based on user interactions.
   - Citation: > Ni, J., Li, J., & McAuley, J. (2019). Justifying Recommendations Using Distantly-Labeled Reviews and Fine-Grained Aspects. In EMNLP-IJCNLP.

In **Table 3**, which summarizes text-paired graph datasets, I will note the following datasets:

1. **ChEMBL-2023**: A database of bioactive drug-like compounds.
   - Citation: > Zdrazil, B., Felix, E., Hunter, F., Manners, E.J., Blackshaw, J., Corbett, S., et al. (2023). The ChEMBL Database in 2023: A Drug Discovery Platform Spanning Multiple Bioactivity Data Types and Time Periods. Nucleic Acids Research.

2. **PubChem**: A free chemistry database maintained by the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI).
   - Citation: > Kim, S., Chen, J., Cheng, T., Gindulyte, A., He, J., He, S., et al. (2019). PubChem 2019 Update: Improved Access to Chemical Data. Nucleic Acids Research.

3. **PC324K**: A dataset for molecular property prediction.
   - Citation: > Liu, Z., Li, S., Luo, Y., Fei, H., Cao, Y., Kawaguchi, K., et al. (2023). MolCA: Molecular Graph-Language Modeling with Cross-Modal Projector and Uni-Modal Adapter. EMNLP.

After identifying these datasets, I will compile the full citations for each dataset into a structured format for easy reference. This process ensures that I accurately capture the datasets discussed in the paper along with their respective citations.
