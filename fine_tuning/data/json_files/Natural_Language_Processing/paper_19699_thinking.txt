To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Contextualizing Generated Citation Texts" by Biswadip Mandal et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, but I need to look for specific mentions of datasets.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the citation text generation task but do not mention any datasets directly. I will continue to the **methodology section**, where they state, "We use the NLP-domain CORWA citation text generation dataset (Li et al., 2022)." This indicates that the CORWA dataset is used in their experiments.

Next, I will check the **results section** to see if there are any additional datasets mentioned. However, the focus remains on the CORWA dataset, and no new datasets are introduced.

Now, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citation for the CORWA dataset. The citation provided in the references is:
> Xiangci Li, Biswadip Mandal, and Jessica Ouyang. *CORWA: A citation-oriented related work annotation dataset*. In Proceedings of the 2022 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, pages 5426â€“5440, Seattle, United States. Association for Computational Linguistics.

Since the paper primarily discusses the CORWA dataset, I will document this dataset in detail.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and full citation, ensuring that all necessary information is captured accurately for future reference or processing.
