To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Heterogeneous Federated Learning: State-of-the-art and Research Challenges" by Mang Ye et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract and introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract provides a high-level overview, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the research, which may include references to datasets used in prior studies.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any subsections that discuss the datasets used in the research. In this paper, I will specifically check for sections that detail the methodologies or experiments, as these often include the datasets employed for validation or testing.

As I read through the paper, I will take note of any datasets mentioned, including their names, descriptions, and any relevant details such as the number of samples, types of data, and the context in which they were used. If the paper discusses multiple datasets, I will ensure to document each one separately.

After identifying the datasets, I will then refer to the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets themselves.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like "LEAF," I will look for its citation in the references, which might include details such as the authors, title, publication venue, and year.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation formatted correctly.

Finally, I will review my findings to ensure accuracy and completeness before finalizing the dataset extraction process. This structured approach will help me systematically extract and document the datasets from the paper.
