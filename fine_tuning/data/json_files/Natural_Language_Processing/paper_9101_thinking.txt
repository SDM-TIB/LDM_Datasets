To extract datasets from the research paper titled "XLM-V: Overcoming the Vocabulary Bottleneck in Multilingual Masked Language Models" by Davis Liang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their model on various tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved. I will look for specific mentions of datasets in these sections.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of existing multilingual models and hint at the datasets used for evaluation. However, I need to find explicit mentions of dataset names.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for training and evaluation. Here, they mention several datasets:

1. **CC100**: A multilingual corpus created from a Common Crawl dump, containing 2.5 TB of data across 116 languages. This dataset is used for constructing vocabularies and pretraining the models.

2. **FLoRes-200**: An evaluation corpus consisting of 3,001 sentences extracted from 842 English Wikipedia articles, translated into 200 languages by professional translators.

3. **XNLI**: A dataset for natural language inference that includes crowd-sourced English data translated into ten other languages.

4. **MLQA**: A question answering dataset created by mining target language sentences parallel to English sentences from Wikipedia.

5. **XQuAD**: A dataset that translates the dev set of SQuAD v1.1 into ten other languages for evaluation.

6. **TyDiQA-GoldP**: A question answering dataset covering 11 diverse languages with 200K QA pairs.

7. **Americas NLI**: An extension of XNLI for ten indigenous languages of the Americas.

8. **MasakhaNER**: A dataset for named entity recognition in ten African languages.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

With all this information gathered, I will now compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing.
