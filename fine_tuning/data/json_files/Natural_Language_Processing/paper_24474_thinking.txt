To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An Efficient NAS-based Approach for Handling Imbalanced Datasets" by Zhiwei Yao, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of an imbalanced CIFAR dataset for performance evaluation, which indicates that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the author discusses the challenges of class imbalance and references previous works. However, I need to look for specific dataset names.

In **section 4 (Experiment Evaluation)**, the author explicitly states that they constructed imbalanced versions of the **CIFAR-10** and **CIFAR-100** datasets. The paper describes how these datasets were modified to simulate real-world class imbalance scenarios, which is crucial for my extraction.

The paper mentions that CIFAR-10 contains 60,000 images divided into 10 classes, and CIFAR-100 has the same number of images but with 100 classes. This detailed description confirms that both datasets are used in the experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
   > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009.

2. For **CIFAR-100**, the citation is:
   > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009. (Note: CIFAR-100 is often referenced alongside CIFAR-10 as they share the same source.)

With this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations as required.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ready for review or further processing.
