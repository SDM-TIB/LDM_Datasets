To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MLOps for Scarce Image Data: A Use Case in Microscopic Image Analysis" by Angelo Yamachui Sitcheu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the paper explores MLOps in the context of scarce data analysis and mentions a proof of concept for fingerprinting in microscopic image datasets, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Preliminary Experiments)**, where the authors describe their experiments. In **section 4.2 (Datasets)**, they explicitly mention the datasets used for evaluation:

1. **MedMNIST v2**: This is a benchmark dataset for 2D and 3D biomedical image classification. The authors specify that they selected all 2D image datasets from MedMNIST v2, which includes 12 datasets consisting of both gray-scale and color images.

The specific datasets mentioned are:
   - **BreastMNIST**
   - **ChestMNIST**
   - **OctMNIST**
   - **OrganaMNIST**
   - **OrgancMNIST**
   - **OrgansMNIST**
   - **PneumoniaMNIST**
   - **TissueMNIST**
   - **BloodMNIST**
   - **DermaMNIST**
   - **RetinaMNIST**
   - **PathMNIST**

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the MedMNIST v2 dataset. The citation provided in the references is:
> Yang, J., Shi, R., Wei, D., Liu, Z., Zhao, L., Ke, B., Pfister, H., & Ni, B. (2021). MedMNIST v2: A Large-Scale Lightweight Benchmark for 2D and 3D Biomedical Image Classification. CoRR, abs/2110.14795.

With this information, I can now compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for output, ensuring that they are clear and ready for any further processing or review.
