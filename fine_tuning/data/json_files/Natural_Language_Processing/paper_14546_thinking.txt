To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Active Visual Localization for Multi-Agent Collaboration: A Data-Driven Approach" by Matthew Hanlon et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a general overview of the research focus, but I need to look for specific datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will examine **section IV (Experiments)**, particularly the subsection **IV-A (Data Generation)**, where the authors discuss the data collection process. Here, they mention the use of the **Habitat-Matterport 3D (HM3D) dataset**, which is crucial for their experiments. The authors describe how they selected scenes from this dataset for their simulated experiments.

In this section, they also mention the use of **NVIDIA Isaac Sim** for simulating the camera setup, but this is not a dataset itself. The key dataset to note is the HM3D dataset, which is used for generating the 3D reconstructions of indoor environments.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citation for the HM3D dataset. The citation is as follows:
> S. K. Ramakrishnan, A. Gokaslan, E. Wijmans, O. Maksymets, A. Clegg, J. Turner, E. Undersander, W. Galuba, A. Westbury, A. X. Chang et al. *Habitat-Matterport 3D Dataset (HM3D): 1000 Large-Scale 3D Environments for Embodied AI*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2109.08238, 2021.

After identifying the dataset and its citation, I will ensure that I have captured all relevant details about the dataset, including its purpose and how it was utilized in the research.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and full citation, ready for further processing or review.
