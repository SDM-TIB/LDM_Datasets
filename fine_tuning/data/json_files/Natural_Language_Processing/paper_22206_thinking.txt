To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MMIST-ccRCC: A Real World Medical Dataset for the Development of Multi-Modal Systems" by Tiago Mota et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract introduces the MMIST-ccRCC dataset, which is a multi-modal dataset comprising various data types related to clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). This indicates that there is at least one dataset to extract.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for further details about the dataset. The authors discuss the challenges of curating multi-modal datasets and mention that MMIST-ccRCC includes data from 618 patients, which reinforces the significance of this dataset.

I will then focus on **section 2 (MMIST-ccRCC Dataset)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the dataset. They specify that MMIST-ccRCC includes:
- 2 radiology modalities (CT and MRI)
- Histopathology data (whole slide images)
- Genomics data
- Clinical data

The section also discusses the number of patients and the distribution of modalities, confirming that this dataset is comprehensive and well-structured for research purposes.

After gathering the necessary information about the MMIST-ccRCC dataset, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citation for this dataset. The authors mention that the dataset was curated from existing repositories, specifically TCGA, TCIA, and CPTAC. Therefore, I will also need to cite these original sources.

The full citation for the MMIST-ccRCC dataset is:
> Tiago Mota, M. Rita Verdelho, Diogo J. AraÃºjo, Alceu Bissoto, Carlos Santiago, Catarina Barata. *MMIST-ccRCC: A Real World Medical Dataset for the Development of Multi-Modal Systems*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Medical Imaging and Computer-Assisted Intervention, 2023.

Additionally, I will include citations for the original datasets from which MMIST-ccRCC was curated:
- For the Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC-CCRCC):
  > National Cancer Institute Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC). *The Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma Collection (CPTAC-CCRCC)*. In The Cancer Imaging Archive, 2018.

- For The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA-KIRC):
  > O. Akin et al. *The Cancer Genome Atlas Kidney Renal Clear Cell Carcinoma Collection (TCGA-KIRC)*. In The Cancer Imaging Archive, 2016.

- For The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA):
  > Kenneth Clark et al. *The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA): Maintaining and Operating a Public Information Repository*. Journal of Digital Imaging, 2013.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
