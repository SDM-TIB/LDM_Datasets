To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Listen to the Waves: Using a Neuronal Model of the Human Auditory System to Predict Ocean Waves" by Artur Matysiak et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** of the paper to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's objectives and methods, which may include references to datasets used for training or validation.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, where the authors typically describe the experimental setup and the data used. In this paper, the authors mention using **simulated wave data generated with the Boussinesq Ocean & Surf Zone (BOSZ) model**. This indicates that there is a dataset related to ocean wave simulations.

In the **appendix**, the authors provide a detailed description of the BOSZ model and the wave scenarios used for training the models. They mention that the model was used to generate **123 hypothetical wave scenarios**, which include various combinations of significant wave heights (Hs) and peak periods (Tp). This is crucial information as it specifies the dataset's characteristics.

Now, I will compile the details of the datasets mentioned:

1. **BOSZ Model Simulated Wave Data**: This dataset consists of simulated wave scenarios generated by the BOSZ model, which includes 123 individual model runs with varying significant wave heights and peak periods. The data is used for training the artificial neural networks in the study.

Next, I will look for the full citation of the BOSZ model to ensure proper attribution. The paper references the original work on the BOSZ model, which is crucial for providing a complete citation.

The citation for the BOSZ model is:
> Roeber, V., Cheung, K.F., Kobayashi, M.H. *Shock-capturing Boussinesq-type model for nearshore wave processes*. Coastal Engineering, 57, 407â€“423 (2010).

Finally, I will summarize the extracted datasets with their respective citations, ensuring that I have accurately captured all relevant information for future reference or processing.
