To extract datasets from the research paper titled "GAOKAO-MM: A Chinese Human-Level Benchmark for Multimodal Models Evaluation" by Yi Zong and Xipeng Qiu, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and dataset description sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract introduces GAOKAO-MM as a multimodal benchmark based on the Chinese College Entrance Examination (GAOKAO), which suggests that this is the primary dataset of interest.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (GAOKAO-MM)**, particularly **subsection 2.1 (Dataset Description)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset. Here, they describe GAOKAO-MM as comprising 646 questions across 8 subjects, with 897 images of various types. This section confirms that GAOKAO-MM is indeed the dataset being evaluated.

In addition, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the GAOKAO-MM dataset. The authors mention that the dataset is derived from the GAOKAO questions collected between 2010 and 2023, but they do not provide a formal citation for the dataset itself. However, I can cite the paper as the source of the dataset.

The citation for the dataset is:
> Yi Zong and Xipeng Qiu. *GAOKAO-MM: A Chinese Human-Level Benchmark for Multimodal Models Evaluation*. In Proceedings of the [Conference Name], [Year]. [Additional details if available].

Since the paper does not provide a specific conference name or year, I will note that this information may need to be filled in based on the publication details.

Now, I will compile the dataset entry for GAOKAO-MM, ensuring to include the full citation as required.

After completing this process, I will have a clear and structured entry for the GAOKAO-MM dataset, ready for further processing or review.
