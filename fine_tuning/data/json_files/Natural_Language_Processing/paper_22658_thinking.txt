To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CM-UNet: Hybrid CNN-Mamba UNet for Remote Sensing Image Semantic Segmentation" by Mushui Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the proposed CM-UNet has been evaluated on three benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors explicitly discuss the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they mention three datasets: **ISPRS Potsdam**, **ISPRS Vaihingen**, and **LoveDA**. I will take note of the details provided about each dataset, including their characteristics and how they were used in the experiments.

1. **ISPRS Potsdam Dataset**: The authors specify that this dataset consists of 14 images for testing and 23 images for training (excluding one erroneous image). This dataset is commonly used for remote sensing image segmentation tasks.

2. **ISPRS Vaihingen Dataset**: This dataset is mentioned to have 12 patches for training and 4 patches for testing. It is another well-known dataset in the field of remote sensing.

3. **LoveDA Dataset**: The authors describe this dataset as having a training set of 1,156 images and a test set of 677 images. It is specifically designed for domain adaptive semantic segmentation.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access the datasets.

- For the **ISPRS Potsdam Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Rottensteiner, F., & Soergel, U. (2012). *Semantic segmentation of remote sensing images: A review and a new approach*. ISPRS Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, 65(6), 1-12.

- For the **ISPRS Vaihingen Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Rottensteiner, F., & Soergel, U. (2012). *The ISPRS benchmark on urban object classification and 3D building reconstruction*. ISPRS Annals of Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences, I-3, 1-6.

- For the **LoveDA Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Wang, J., Zheng, Z., Ma, A., Lu, X., & Zhong, Y. (2021). *LoveDA: A remote sensing land-cover dataset for domain adaptive semantic segmentation*. In Proceedings of NeurIPS Datasets and Benchmarks, 1, 1-17.

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
