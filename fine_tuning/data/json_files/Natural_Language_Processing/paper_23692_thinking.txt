To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Hybrid Video Anomaly Detection for Anomalous Scenarios in Autonomous Driving" by Daniel Bogdoll et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract discusses the evaluation of their method on the **AnoVox dataset**, which is a clear indication that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will look into the **methodology** section, particularly where the authors describe their training and evaluation processes. In this section, they mention that they trained their model on simulated data collected with the **CARLA simulation engine** and evaluated it on the **AnoVox dataset**. This confirms the use of these datasets.

I will also check the **evaluation** section, where the authors provide details about the **AnoVox benchmark** and its specific scenarios, which further emphasizes its importance in their experiments.

Now, I will consult the **references section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. For the **AnoVox dataset**, the citation is:
   > Bogdoll, D., Hamdard, I., Rössler, L. N., Geisler, F., Bayram, M., Wang, F., Imhof, J., de Campos, M., Tabarov, A., Yang, Y., Gottschalk, H., & Zöllner, J. M. (2023). AnoVox: A Benchmark for Multimodal Anomaly Detection in Autonomous Driving.

2. For the **CARLA simulation engine**, the citation is:
   > Dosovitskiy, A., Ros, G., Codevilla, F., Lopez, A., & Koltun, V. (2017). CARLA: An Open Urban Driving Simulator.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and that the full citations are included for reference. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
