To extract datasets from the research paper titled "OMPGPT: A Generative Pre-trained Transformer Model for OpenMP" by Le Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions, but I will need to delve deeper into the main body of the text for specific dataset details.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Approach)**, where the authors describe their methodology. Here, they mention using a dataset called **HPCorpus**, which is derived from GitHub repositories containing C, C++, and Fortran code. This is a significant dataset for their model training, and I will note its details.

In **section 3.2 (OMP GPT Training)**, the authors provide more information about HPCorpus, including its size and the number of repositories it contains. They state that HPCorpus includes 144,522 repositories with C code and 150,481 repositories with C++ code, totaling over 8 million C code functions and over 68 million C++ code functions. This dataset is crucial for their model's training and fine-tuning.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for HPCorpus. The authors reference a paper by Kadosh et al. (2023) that introduces HPCorpus. The citation I will extract is:
> Tal Kadosh, Niranjan Hasabnis, Timothy Mattson, Yuval Pinter, and Gal Oren. 2023. Quantifying OpenMP: Statistical insights into usage and adoption. In 2023 IEEE High Performance Extreme Computing Conference (HPEC). IEEE, 1â€“7.

Now, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format, ensuring to include the full citation for HPCorpus as it is essential for proper attribution.

Finally, I will summarize the findings and prepare the dataset entries for further processing or review.
