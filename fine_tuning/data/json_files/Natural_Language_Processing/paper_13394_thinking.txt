To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Learning for Structure-Preserving Universal Stable Koopman-Inspired Embeddings for Nonlinear Canonical Hamiltonian Dynamics" by Pawan Goyal et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often discusses the context and relevance of the datasets used.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. I will look for any specific names of datasets, descriptions of their contents, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

In this paper, the authors mention several examples, including the **nonlinear pendulum**, **nonlinear oscillator**, and **Lotka-Volterra model**. I will check if these examples are based on publicly available datasets or if they are synthetic datasets generated by the authors. 

For each dataset identified, I will ensure to extract the following information:
1. **Dataset Name**: The official name of the dataset.
2. **Description**: A brief description of the dataset, including its purpose and contents.
3. **Citation**: The full citation for the dataset, which may include the authors, title, publication venue, and year.

I will also check the **References section** for any citations related to the datasets mentioned in the experiments. If the datasets are derived from existing literature, I will ensure to provide the original source.

For example, if the authors mention using a dataset for the nonlinear pendulum, I will look for:
- The specific dataset name (e.g., "Nonlinear Pendulum Dataset").
- A description of how the dataset was generated or collected.
- The citation for the dataset, which may refer to a previous study or a specific methodology used to create the dataset.

After gathering all this information, I will compile it into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly documented with its citation.

Finally, I will review the entire paper to ensure that no datasets have been overlooked and that all relevant information has been accurately captured.
