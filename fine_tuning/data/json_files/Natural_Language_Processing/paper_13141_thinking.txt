To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On the accuracy of interpolation based on single-layer artificial neural networks with a focus on defeating the Runge phenomenon" by Ferdinando Auricchio et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus, but I need to look for specific datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** in detail, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their analysis. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

In this paper, the authors discuss various functions and interpolation methods, but they do not explicitly mention any datasets in the traditional sense (like image or text datasets). Instead, they refer to mathematical functions and examples used for testing their methods, such as Runge's function and other analytic functions. 

I will note these functions as they serve as the basis for the experiments conducted in the paper. For instance, Runge's function is defined as:
- **Runge's function**: \( f_R(x) = \frac{1}{1 + 25x^2} \), used for testing the interpolation accuracy.

Additionally, the authors mention other functions like:
- **Polynomial function**: A randomly generated polynomial function used for testing.
- **Analytic functions**: Functions like \( \cos(20x) \) and \( \sqrt{2 - x} \) are also discussed as part of the experiments.

After identifying these functions, I will check the **References section** to see if any of these functions or datasets have associated citations. However, since these are mathematical functions rather than datasets from external sources, they may not have formal citations.

Finally, I will compile the identified functions and their descriptions, ensuring to format them correctly and provide any relevant citations if available. If no formal citations exist for these functions, I will note that they are standard mathematical examples commonly used in numerical analysis.

In summary, my extraction process will focus on identifying the mathematical functions used in the experiments, as they serve as the datasets for the study, and I will document them accordingly.
