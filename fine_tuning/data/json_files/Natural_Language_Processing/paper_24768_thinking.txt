To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Large Language Models for Power Scheduling: A User-Centric Approach" by Thomas Mongaillard et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections for any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the construction of a database (EVRQ) of typical voice requests in the context of electric vehicle (EV) charging, which indicates that a dataset is indeed present.

Next, I will look into the **performance evaluation section** (Section IV) where the authors describe the creation of the EVRQ dataset in detail. They mention that this dataset includes 800 requests designed to capture various types of decisions relevant to different EV charging problems, with labels for each request, including ground-truth optimization problem classes and optimal solutions. This section provides crucial information about the dataset's structure and purpose.

I will also check the **appendix and references** sections for any additional datasets or citations related to the EVRQ dataset. However, the primary focus will be on the EVRQ dataset as it is the only one explicitly mentioned in the paper.

Now, I will compile the full citation for the dataset:

- For the **EVRQ dataset**, the citation is:
  > Mongaillard, T., Lasaulce, S., Hicheur, O., Zhang, C., Bariah, L., Varma, V. S., Zou, H., Zhao, Q., & Debbah, M. (2023). Large Language Models for Power Scheduling: A User-Centric Approach. *arXiv preprint arXiv:2402.10172*.

After gathering this information, I will prepare to format the dataset entry according to the required structure, ensuring that the citation is included and accurately reflects the source of the dataset. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the dataset used in the research paper.
