To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Plausibility Study of Using Augmented Reality in the Ventriculoperitoneal Shunt Operations" by Tandin Dorji et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, proposed method, experiments, and conclusion sections** to identify any datasets mentioned or described. The abstract provides a general overview of the study, but I need to look for specific datasets in the later sections.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the context of hydrocephalus and the use of ventriculoperitoneal shunting (VP shunting), but they do not mention any datasets directly. I will continue to the next sections.

In the **proposed method**, the authors describe the process of obtaining CT slides and creating virtual models. They mention using **DICOM files** as the foundation for creating these models, but again, no specific datasets are named.

Moving to the **experiments section**, I find that the authors used **CT slides supplied by Thammasat University Hospital**. They specify that three different sets of CT slides were employed, with each set utilizing **243 CT slides**. This is a crucial detail as it indicates the dataset used for their experiments.

Next, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The authors refer to the use of **Philips IQon Elite Spectral** and **Philips Brilliance iCT 256-slice CT scanners** for data collection, but these are not datasets themselves. The actual dataset is the collection of CT slides from Thammasat University Hospital, which may not have a formal citation like published datasets.

Since the paper does not provide a formal citation for the CT slides, I will note that the dataset is derived from a specific institution and is not publicly available. However, I will still document the details as follows:

1. **CT Slides from Thammasat University Hospital**: This dataset consists of three sets of CT slides, with each set containing 243 slides used for modeling the skull and ventricles.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring to include the details about the dataset and its source, even if it lacks a formal citation.

In summary, I have identified the dataset used in the study, which is the CT slides from Thammasat University Hospital, and I will document it accordingly.
