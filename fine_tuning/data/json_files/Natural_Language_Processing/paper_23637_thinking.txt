To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On the Importance of Reasoning for Context Retrieval in Repository-Level Code Editing" by Alexander Kovrigin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the importance of context retrieval in repository-level code editing, which suggests that datasets may be involved in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experiments & Results)**, particularly subsection **3.2 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention two datasets:

1. **SWE-bench Lite**: This dataset is a smaller subset of the SWE-bench benchmark, consisting of 300 issues across 11 Python repositories. It is designed for evaluating context retrieval strategies in repository-level code editing.

2. **LCA Code Editing**: This dataset contains curated commit messages that serve as natural language instructions and corresponding code changes. It consists of 119 data points from 39 GitHub repositories and focuses on large-scale changes.

Now, I will look for the **full citations** for these datasets in the **References section** of the paper:

- For **SWE-bench**, the citation is:
  > Carlos E Jimenez, John Yang, Alexander Wettig, Shunyu Yao, Kexin Pei, Ofir Press, and Karthik R Narasimhan. *SWE-bench: Can language models resolve real-world GitHub issues?* In The Twelfth International Conference on Learning Representations, 2024.

- For **LCA Code Editing**, the citation is:
  > Aleksandra Eliseeva. *LCA Code Editing Dataset*, 2024.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets and their citations clearly, ensuring that I have accurately captured all necessary details for future reference.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that is ready for review or further processing, ensuring that the full citations are included for each dataset.
