To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SLAM for Multiple Extended Targets using 5G Signal" by Wangjun Jiang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on 5G SLAM and mentions a new mapping error metric, but it does not specify any datasets.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any references to datasets. The introduction discusses the challenges of SLAM and the use of 5G signals but does not mention specific datasets.

Moving on to the **system model and signal model sections**, I will look for any experimental setups or simulations that might involve datasets. The paper describes the SLAM system model and the use of 5G signals but does not provide specific datasets.

In the **performance analysis and simulation results section**, I will check for any datasets used in the simulations. The authors mention simulation parameters and results but do not specify any datasets.

Finally, I will review the **references section** to see if any datasets are cited indirectly through the works referenced. However, the references primarily consist of studies and papers related to SLAM and 5G technology, rather than specific datasets.

After thoroughly reviewing the paper, it appears that there are no explicit datasets mentioned or cited. The authors focus on the theoretical aspects and simulations of their proposed method without providing specific datasets for validation.

Since no datasets are identified in the paper, I will not be able to provide full citations for any datasets. Instead, I will summarize the findings regarding the absence of datasets in the paper.

In conclusion, while the paper presents valuable insights into 5G SLAM and the proposed ET-GOPSA metric, it does not include specific datasets for evaluation or reference. Therefore, I will document this finding accordingly.
