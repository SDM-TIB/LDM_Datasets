To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Large Language Models Sensitivity to The Order of Options in Multiple-Choice Questions" by Pouya Pezeshkpour and Estevam Hruschka, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the sensitivity of LLMs to the order of options in multiple-choice questions, but it does not specify any datasets at this point.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental details section** where the authors describe the benchmarks used for their experiments. In this section, they mention five distinct multiple-choice question benchmarks:

1. **CSQA**: A commonsense multiple-choice question answering dataset, where each question is accompanied by five options.
2. **MMLU (Massive Multitask Language Understanding)**: This benchmark includes multiple-choice questions from various domains, specifically mentioning three subjects: Abstract Algebra, High School Chemistry, and Professional Law, each with four options.
3. **Big-Bench**: This dataset includes logical deduction questions with three options.

I will also check the **references section** to find full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets mentioned are as follows:

- For **CSQA**, the citation is:
  > Alon Talmor, Jonathan Herzig, Nicholas Lourie, and Jonathan Berant. *CommonsenseQA: A Question Answering Challenge Targeting Commonsense Knowledge*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1811.00937, 2018.

- For **MMLU**, the citation is:
  > Dan Hendrycks, Collin Burns, Steven Basart, Andy Zou, Mantas Mazeika, Dawn Song, and Jacob Steinhardt. *Measuring Massive Multitask Language Understanding*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2009.03300, 2020.

- For **Big-Bench**, the citation is:
  > Aarohi Srivastava, Abhinav Rastogi, Abhishek Rao, Abu Awal Md Shoeb, Abubakar Abid, Adam Fisch, Adam R Brown, Adam Santoro, Aditya Gupta, Adri√† Garriga-Alonso, et al. *Beyond the Imitation Game: Quantifying and Extrapolating the Capabilities of Language Models*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2206.04615, 2022.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets referenced in the paper along with their full citations.
