To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards augmented data quality management: Automation of Data Quality Rule Definition in Data Warehouses" by Heidi Carolina Tamm and Anastasija Nikiforova, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, results, and discussion sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's objectives and findings, which may hint at the datasets used.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, where the authors describe their systematic review of existing data quality tools. This section is likely to contain specific references to datasets or tools that were evaluated, which may include datasets used for testing or validation purposes.

In the **results section**, I will look for any tables or figures that summarize the datasets or tools reviewed. The authors may provide a list of the tools along with their functionalities, which could include datasets associated with those tools.

Finally, I will check the **discussion section** for any mentions of datasets that were particularly significant in the context of the study's findings. The authors may discuss the implications of their findings in relation to specific datasets.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets or tools mentioned in the paper. This is crucial for providing proper attribution and context for each dataset.

If the paper does not explicitly mention datasets, I will note that as well, indicating that the focus was primarily on tools rather than specific datasets.

Once I have gathered all the relevant information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset as required.
