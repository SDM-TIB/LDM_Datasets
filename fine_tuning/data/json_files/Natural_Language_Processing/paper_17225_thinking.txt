To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Model-free Learning of Corridor Clearance: A Near-term Deployment Perspective" by Dajiang Suo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned or referenced. The abstract discusses the use of deep reinforcement learning for corridor clearance but does not explicitly mention any datasets.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** where datasets are typically detailed. I will look for any specific datasets used for simulations or evaluations. If the authors mention any datasets, I will note their names and descriptions.

I will also check the **background and related work sections** for any references to datasets used in previous studies that might be relevant to the current research. This could provide context for the datasets used in this paper.

If the paper includes a **results section**, I will look for any tables or figures that might summarize the datasets used in the experiments. This could include performance metrics or comparisons that rely on specific datasets.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like the **SUMO microscopic traffic simulator**, I would look for its citation in the references. The citation might look like this:
> P. A. Lopez, M. Behrisch, L. Bieker-Walz, J. Erdmann, Y.-P. Flötteröd, R. Hilbrich, L. Lücken, J. Rummel, P. Wagner, and E. Wießner, "Microscopic traffic simulation using SUMO," in The 21st International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems. IEEE, 2018. [Online]. Available: https://elib.dlr.de/124092/

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant datasets from the paper.
