To extract datasets from the research paper titled "HalluDial: A Large-Scale Benchmark for Automatic Dialogue-Level Hallucination Evaluation" by Wen Luo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that HalluDial is a comprehensive benchmark for dialogue-level hallucination evaluation, which suggests that it is a dataset itself. I will note this down as it is crucial for my extraction.

Next, I will examine **section 2 (The HalluDial Benchmark)**, where the authors describe the dataset in detail. Here, I will look for specific information about the dataset's structure, size, and the scenarios it covers. The paper states that HalluDial includes 4,094 dialogues with a total of 146,856 samples, which is significant data to note.

In **section 2.1 (Spontaneous Hallucination Scenario)** and **section 2.2 (Induced Hallucination Scenario)**, the authors describe how the dataset was constructed, including the methods used for sampling and annotation. I will extract this information to provide context about how the dataset was created and its intended use.

I will also check the **References section** to find any citations related to the datasets mentioned. The paper references the **FaithDial dataset** (Dziri et al., 2022), which is used as a source for some of the dialogues in HalluDial. I will ensure to include this citation as it is relevant to the dataset's composition.

The full citation for the **FaithDial dataset** is:
> Nouha Dziri, Ehsan Kamalloo, Sivan Milton, Osmar Zaiane, Mo Yu, Edoardo M Ponti, and Siva Reddy. *FaithDial: A Faithful Benchmark for Information-Seeking Dialogue*. Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics, 10:1473â€“1490, 2022.

Now, I will compile the extracted information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset. The HalluDial dataset itself will be noted as follows:

- **HalluDial Dataset**: A large-scale benchmark for automatic dialogue-level hallucination evaluation, comprising 4,094 dialogues and 146,856 samples.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for review, ensuring that all relevant details and citations are included for clarity and completeness.
