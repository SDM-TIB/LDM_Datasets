To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Exploring Self-supervised Logic-enhanced Training for Large Language Models" by Fangkai Jiao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors applied their method to two logical reasoning benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this paper, they mention using two logical reasoning benchmarks: **ReClor** and **LogiQA-v2**. I will look for specific details about these datasets, such as their purpose, size, and any unique characteristics.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide the following details:

1. **ReClor**: This dataset is designed for reading comprehension and requires logical reasoning. It is sourced from standardized graduate admission examinations.
   
2. **LogiQA-v2**: This dataset is also for logical reasoning in machine reading comprehension and is derived from logical examination papers intended for reading comprehension.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

- For **ReClor**, the citation is:
  > Yu, Y., & Khashabi, D. (2020). *ReClor: A Reading Comprehension Dataset Requiring Logical Reasoning*. In ICLR. OpenReview.

- For **LogiQA-v2**, the citation is:
  > Liu, H., Cui, L., Liu, H., Huang, D., Wang, Y., & Zhang, Y. (2022). *LogiQA2.0 Dataset - Logical Reasoning in MRC and NLI Tasks*. TASLP.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their respective citations.
