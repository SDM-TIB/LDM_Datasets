To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Chinese Fine-Grained Financial Sentiment Analysis with Large Language Models" by Yinyu Lan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract introduces the **FinChina SA dataset**, which is specifically designed for fine-grained sentiment analysis in the financial domain. This indicates that there is at least one dataset to extract.

Next, I will look into the **data collection** section, where the authors describe the process of creating the FinChina SA dataset. They mention that they crawled data from major financial news websites and annotated a total of **11,036 news articles**, which included **8,739 companies**, **190 warning types**, and **21,272 sentiment examples**. This detailed description provides essential information about the dataset.

In the **conclusion** section, the authors reiterate the significance of the **FinChina SA dataset** and its potential impact on future research in financial sentiment analysis. This further confirms the dataset's importance and relevance.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the FinChina SA dataset. However, since the dataset is newly proposed in this paper and does not reference an external source, I will note that the dataset is publicly available at the provided GitHub link: https://github.com/YerayL/FinChina-SA.

The dataset can be summarized as follows:

1. **FinChina SA Dataset**: A novel large-scale dataset designed for fine-grained sentiment analysis in the Chinese financial domain, consisting of 11,036 annotated news articles, 8,739 companies, 190 warning types, and 21,272 sentiment examples.

Since there is only one dataset mentioned in this paper, I will compile the information into a structured format for clarity.

Finally, I will ensure that the dataset entry includes the citation for the paper itself, as it serves as the primary source for the dataset.

The full citation for the paper is:
> Yinyu Lan, Yanru Wu, Wang Xu, Weiqiang Feng, and Youhao Zhang. *Chinese Fine-Grained Financial Sentiment Analysis with Large Language Models*. FinChina AI Research. 

Now, I will prepare the dataset entry for the FinChina SA dataset, ensuring that it is ready for further processing or review.
