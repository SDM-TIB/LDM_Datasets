To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Hearing Lips in Noise: Universal Viseme-Phoneme Mapping and Transfer for Robust Audio-Visual Speech Recognition" by Yuchen Hu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that extensive experiments were conducted on public benchmarks, specifically **LRS3** and **LRS2**, which indicates that these datasets are likely to be important for the research.

Next, I will look for specific sections that detail the datasets used. In the **experiments section**, the authors explicitly state that they conducted experiments on **LRS3** and **LRS2** datasets. I will gather information about these datasets, including their characteristics and any relevant details provided in the paper.

1. **LRS3 Dataset**: The paper describes LRS3 as a large-scale dataset that collects 433 hours of transcribed English videos from TED and TEDx talks. This dataset is crucial for the experiments conducted in the study.

2. **LRS2 Dataset**: Similarly, LRS2 is mentioned as containing 224 hours of video speech from BBC programs. This dataset is also used for the experiments and is noted for its challenging conditions due to variations in head pose and lighting.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are essential for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

- For **LRS3**, the citation is:
  > Triantafyllos Afouras, Joon Son Chung, and Andrew Zisserman. *LRS3-TED: A Large-Scale Dataset for Visual Speech Recognition*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1809.00496, 2018.

- For **LRS2**, the citation is:
  > Joon Son Chung, Andrew Senior, Oriol Vinyals, and Andrew Zisserman. *Lip Reading Sentences in the Wild*. In 2017 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 3444â€“3453, 2017.

With this information gathered, I will now compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research.
