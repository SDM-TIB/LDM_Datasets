To extract datasets from the research paper titled "LLMARENA: Assessing Capabilities of Large Language Models in Dynamic Multi-Agent Environments" by Junzhe Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the introduction of LLMARENA as a framework for evaluating LLMs in multi-agent environments, but it does not specify any datasets at this point.

Next, I will examine the **Benchmark Detail section** (Section 2) closely, as this is likely where the authors would describe the datasets used in their experiments. In this section, the authors outline seven distinct gaming environments that comprise LLMARENA. Each environment serves as a dataset for evaluating the capabilities of LLMs.

1. **TicTacToe**: A strategy game played on a 3x3 grid. The dataset consists of game states and actions taken by LLM agents.
2. **ConnectFour**: A more complex board game played on a 6x7 grid. The dataset includes game states and actions similar to TicTacToe.
3. **Texas Hold’em**: A card game where the dataset includes hand cards, community cards, and actions taken by LLM agents.
4. **Undercover**: A party game involving multiple agents, where the dataset consists of clues and voting actions.
5. **Bargain**: A negotiation game where the dataset includes item values and bargaining actions.
6. **Bid**: A first-price sealed-bid auction game, with a dataset that includes bids and valuations.
7. **Hanabi**: A cooperative card game with a dataset that includes hand cards and actions taken by LLM agents.

In the **experiments section**, the authors mention that they conducted extensive evaluations across these environments, confirming that these environments serve as datasets for their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets or foundational works mentioned. However, since the environments are created as part of the LLMARENA framework and do not refer to external datasets, I will note that the datasets are derived from the game environments themselves rather than traditional datasets.

The citations for the foundational works referenced in the paper, such as the TrueSkill™ scoring system, are as follows:

- For TrueSkill™:
  > Ralf Herbrich, Tom Minka, and Thore Graepel. *Trueskill™: a bayesian skill rating system*. Advances in neural information processing systems, 19, 2006.

Since the datasets are not traditional datasets with external citations, I will summarize the environments as datasets in my final output.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset (environment) and its purpose in the context of the research, ensuring to include the relevant citations for any foundational concepts or systems used in the evaluation.
