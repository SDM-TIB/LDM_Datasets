To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Better Multi-modal Keyphrase Generation via Visual Entity Enhancement and Multi-granularity Image Noise Filtering" by Yifan Dong et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on a benchmark dataset, which indicates that datasets are involved. The introduction further elaborates on the task of multi-modal keyphrase generation, hinting at the use of specific datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors explicitly mention using two datasets in **section 4.1 (Setup)**:

1. **TRC Dataset**: This dataset is used for training the model via the image-text matching task. It contains four types of Twitter posts with different text-image relations. The authors provide a link to the dataset: https://github.com/danielpreotiuc/text-image-relationship/.

2. **Multi-modal Keyphrase Generation Dataset**: This dataset was collected by Wang et al. and includes 53,701 English tweets, each comprising a distinct text-image pair with user-annotated hashtags serving as keyphrases. The authors reference this dataset as a benchmark for their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **TRC Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Daniel Preotiuc. *Text-Image Relationship Dataset*. Available at: https://github.com/danielpreotiuc/text-image-relationship/.

- For the **Multi-modal Keyphrase Generation Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yue Wang, Jing Li, Michael R. Lyu, and Irwin King. *Cross-Media Keyphrase Prediction: A Unified Framework with Multi-Modality Multi-Head Attention and Image Wordings*. In Proceedings of the 2020 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), pages 3311â€“3324, 2020. https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2020.emnlp-main.268.

After gathering this information, I will ensure that I accurately represent each dataset's details, including their purpose and any relevant statistics mentioned in the paper.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that is ready for review or further processing, ensuring that the full citations are included for each dataset.
