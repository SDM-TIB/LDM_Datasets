To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Low-Rank Mixture-of-Experts for Continual Medical Image Segmentation" by Qian Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors validate their method on multiple datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will look into the **experimental setup** section, specifically **section 3**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention five datasets: **ACDC**, **ISIC**, **COVID-19 Segmentation dataset**, **BTCV**, and **LiTS**. I will note down the details provided for each dataset, including their purpose and any specific characteristics mentioned.

In the **3.1 Dataset** subsection, the authors provide additional context for each dataset:

1. **ACDC**: A publicly available dataset for the automated cardiac diagnosis challenge, split into training, validation, and testing samples.
2. **ISIC**: A dataset for skin lesion segmentation, containing images with lesions and corresponding labels.
3. **COVID-19 Segmentation dataset**: Comprising axial CT images for COVID-19 lung infection segmentation.
4. **BTCV**: A dataset containing labeled abdominal CT scans, divided into training and testing sets.
5. **LiTS**: A dataset for liver and liver tumor segmentation, consisting of contrast-enhanced abdominal CT images.

Next, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. Here are the citations I will extract:

- For **ACDC**, the citation is:
  > Bernard, O., et al. "Deep learning techniques for automatic MRI cardiac multi-structures segmentation and diagnosis: is the problem solved?" *IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging*, 37(11), 2514–2525, 2018.

- For **ISIC**, the citation is:
  > Codella, N., et al. "Skin lesion analysis toward melanoma detection 2018: A challenge hosted by the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC)." *arXiv preprint arXiv:1902.03368*, 2019.

- For **COVID-19 Segmentation dataset**, the citation is:
  > Fan, D.P., et al. "Inf-Net: Automatic COVID-19 lung infection segmentation from CT images." *IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging*, 39(8), 2626–2637, 2020.

- For **BTCV**, the citation is:
  > Zhang, Y., et al. "Continual learning for abdominal multi-organ and tumor segmentation." In *International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer-Assisted Intervention*, pp. 35–45, Springer, 2023.

- For **LiTS**, the citation is:
  > Bilic, P., et al. "The liver tumor segmentation benchmark (LiTS)." *Medical Image Analysis*, 84, 102680, 2023.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, facilitating further exploration and validation of the findings presented in the paper.
