To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Risk exchange under infinite-mean Pareto models" by Yuyu Chen, Paul Embrechts, and Ruodu Wang, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus, but I need to look for specific datasets in the main body of the paper.

Next, I will examine **section 6 (Some simple examples based on real data)**, as this section explicitly discusses datasets. Here, the authors mention two datasets:

1. **Marine losses dataset**: This dataset consists of 1,274 marine losses (paid) collected by a French private insurer between January 2003 and June 2006. The authors reference the source as the CASdatasets repository.

2. **Wildfire suppression costs dataset**: This dataset includes 10,915 suppression costs in Alberta, Canada, collected from 1983 to 1995. The authors provide a link to the historical wildfire database for further details.

I will now look for the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

- For the **marine losses dataset**, the citation is:
  > CASdatasets. *Marine losses dataset*. Available at http://cas.uqam.ca/.

- For the **wildfire suppression costs dataset**, the citation is:
  > Alberta Government. *Historical Wildfire Database*. Available at https://wildfire.alberta.ca/resources/historical-data/historical-wildfire-database.aspx.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This structured approach will help maintain clarity and ensure that all relevant details are captured accurately.
