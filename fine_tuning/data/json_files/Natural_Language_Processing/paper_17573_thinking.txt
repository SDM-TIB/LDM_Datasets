To extract datasets from the research paper titled "K-PERM: Personalized Response Generation Using Dynamic Knowledge Retrieval and Persona-Adaptive Queries" by Kanak Raj et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, experiments, and conclusion sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that K-PERM achieves state-of-the-art performance on the **FoCus dataset**, which suggests that this dataset is crucial for the research.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. Here, the authors state that they utilize the **FoCus dataset** developed by Jang et al. (2022) for their experiments. The dataset is described in detail, including its structure and the number of dialogs it contains, which confirms its significance in the study.

In the **appendix**, the authors provide additional details about the **FoCus dataset**, including its composition, the number of dialogs, and how it was split into training, validation, and test sets. This information is essential for understanding the dataset's context and usage.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the **FoCus dataset**. The citation is as follows:
> Jang, Y.; Lim, J.; Hur, Y.; Oh, D.; Son, S.; Lee, Y.; Shin, D.; Kim, S.; and Lim, H. 2022. Call for Customized Conversation: Customized Conversation Grounding Persona and Knowledge. In Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, volume 36, 10803â€“10812.

Since the paper primarily focuses on the **FoCus dataset**, I will ensure to document this dataset thoroughly, including its details and citation.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format that highlights the dataset's name, description, and citation, ensuring that all necessary details are included for future reference or processing.
