To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Pre-trained Trojan Attacks for Visual Recognition" by Aishan Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments on downstream detection and segmentation tasks using multiple benchmark datasets. This indicates that datasets are likely discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors describe their experiments in section 5, where they mention using the **ImageNet dataset** for training and evaluating their models. They also refer to the **COCO dataset** for downstream tasks, specifically for object detection and instance segmentation.

I will then check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. **ImageNet Dataset**: The citation for the ImageNet dataset is:
   > Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, and Li Fei-Fei. *Imagenet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In CVPR, 2009.

2. **COCO Dataset**: The citation for the COCO dataset is:
   > Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, Serge Belongie, James Hays, Pietro Perona, Deva Ramanan, Piotr Doll√°r, and C Lawrence Zitnick. *Microsoft coco: Common objects in context*. In ECCV, 2014.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, which is crucial for reproducibility and further research.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for easy reference and use in future work.
