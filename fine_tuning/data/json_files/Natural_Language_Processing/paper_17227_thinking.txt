To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Survey of Classical And Quantum Sequence Models" by I-Chi Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's objectives and may hint at the datasets used for experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this paper, the authors mention testing their models on various datasets, including:

1. **Meaning Classification (MC) Dataset**: This dataset consists of 130 samples, with 70 training samples and 30 test samples. It is used to classify the meaning of sentences.

2. **Relative Pronoun (RP) Dataset**: This dataset contains 105 samples, with 74 training samples and 31 test samples. It is designed to identify nouns as subjects or objects in sentences.

3. **Amazon Dataset**: This dataset includes 1000 samples, used for sentiment analysis based on product reviews.

4. **Yelp Dataset**: Similar to the Amazon dataset, this dataset also contains 1000 samples for sentiment analysis based on restaurant reviews.

5. **IMDB Dataset**: Another dataset with 1000 samples, used for sentiment analysis of movie reviews.

6. **Sklearn Digits Dataset**: This dataset consists of 280 samples for digit classification tasks.

7. **MNIST Dataset**: A well-known dataset for handwritten digit recognition, containing 500 samples.

8. **FashionMNIST Dataset**: This dataset includes 500 samples for classifying clothing items.

In the **results section**, the authors provide performance metrics for these datasets, confirming their use in the experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. The citations may not always be explicitly listed, but I can infer them based on common knowledge or by looking up the datasets:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details or datasets mentioned in the paper.
