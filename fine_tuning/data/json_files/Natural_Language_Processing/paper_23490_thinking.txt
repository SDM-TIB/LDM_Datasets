To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Sound Heuristic Search Value Iteration for Undiscounted POMDPs with Reachability Objectives" by Qi Heng Ho et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental evaluation sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the datasets used.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **experiments** where the authors typically describe the datasets in detail. In this paper, the authors mention using benchmark problems for their experimental evaluations, which suggests that specific datasets or problem instances are utilized.

In the **experimental evaluation section**, the authors list various benchmark problems, including:

1. **Nrp8**: A non-repudiation protocol for information transfer.
2. **Crypt4**: A model of the dining cryptographers protocol.
3. **Rocks12**: A rover exploring a planet to collect rocks.
4. **Grid Avoid**: A classical POMDP problem with obstacles and target states.
5. **Drone**: Problems involving navigating a drone in a grid while avoiding obstacles.
6. **Refuel**: Problems where the agent must reach a target state while managing energy.

I will also check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets or benchmark problems mentioned. The references may include foundational papers or datasets that describe the problems in detail.

For example, I will look for citations related to:

- The Nrp8 problem, which may reference the original paper by Norman et al. (2017).
- The Crypt4 problem, also likely referencing Norman et al. (2017).
- The Rocks12 problem, which may reference Bouton et al. (2020).
- The Grid Avoid problems, which may reference the same foundational work by Norman et al. (2017).
- The Drone problems, which may reference Bork et al. (2020).
- The Refuel problems, which may also reference Bork et al. (2020).

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the datasets along with their full citations. Each dataset will be described with its name, a brief description, and the corresponding citation.

Finally, I will ensure that the citations are formatted correctly and include all necessary details such as authors, title, conference/journal name, and year of publication. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
