To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Inclusion Matching for Animation Paint Bucket Colorization" by Yuekun Dai et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the development of a unique dataset called **PaintBucket-Character**, which is a strong indication that this dataset is central to the research.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Paint Bucket Colorization Dataset)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the **PaintBucket-Character dataset**. They describe it as comprising 11,345 training images and 3,200 test images, specifically designed for character animations. This section also highlights the dataset's unique features, such as the absence of anti-aliasing and the inclusion of both 3D rendered and hand-drawn frames.

In addition to the primary dataset, I will also look for any other datasets mentioned in the paper. The authors reference the **AnimeRun dataset** in the context of comparing their proposed dataset. They note that AnimeRun consists of 1,760 training images and is used for segment matching, but they also point out its limitations.

Now, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for both datasets:

1. **PaintBucket-Character Dataset**: Since this dataset is newly introduced in the paper, it does not have a separate citation. However, I will note it as part of the contributions of this research.

2. **AnimeRun Dataset**: The citation for this dataset is:
   > Li Siyao, Yuhang Li, Bo Li, Chao Dong, Ziwei Liu, and Chen Change Loy. *Animerun: 2D animation visual correspondence from open source 3D movies*. NeurIPS, 2022.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citation for the AnimeRun dataset and note the PaintBucket-Character dataset as a significant contribution of the paper.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring clarity and completeness for any further processing or review.
