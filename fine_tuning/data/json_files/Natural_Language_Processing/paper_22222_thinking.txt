To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Controlled Experiment on the Energy Efficiency of the Source Code Generated by Code Llama" by Vlad-Andrei Cursaru et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's goals and methods, which may hint at the datasets used. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the research, potentially mentioning specific datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly the parts that describe the experimental design and the programming problems used. The authors mention three programming problems: **Closest Numbers (CN)**, **Two Sum (TS)**, and **String Replacement (SR)**. I will note these problems as they are central to the experiments conducted.

In the **results section**, I will look for any references to datasets or benchmarks used for comparison. The authors mention that the human-written implementations of the problems were sourced from platforms like **HackerRank** and **LeetCode**. This indicates that these platforms serve as datasets for the experiments.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the **References section** of the paper. The citations for the datasets are crucial for proper attribution:

1. For the **HackerRank** dataset, the citation is:
   > HackerRank. *Closest Numbers Problem*. [Online]. Available: https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/closest-numbers/problem

2. For the **LeetCode** dataset, the citation is:
   > LeetCode. *Two Sum Problem*. [Online]. Available: https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/solutions/4082514/98-21-hashmap-time-complexity-1-line-code/

3. For the **String Replacement** problem, the authors mention that the implementation was found in various sources, including:
   > GeeksforGeeks. *How to search and replace text in a file in Python*. [Online]. Available: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-search-and-replace-text-in-a-file-in-python/

After identifying the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset, its description, and the corresponding citation.

This systematic approach ensures that I accurately capture all relevant datasets and provide proper citations, which is essential for academic integrity and further research.
