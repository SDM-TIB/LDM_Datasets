To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Two-Dimensional Frequency-Difference-of-Arrival Varieties" by Jeanne Duflot, Margaret Cheney, and James A. Given, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections that discuss experiments or methodologies** to find any references to datasets. The abstract typically provides a concise overview, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the research, which may include dataset mentions.

Next, I will look for specific sections that are likely to detail datasets, such as **"Datasets," "Experiments," or "Methodology."** These sections usually contain explicit mentions of datasets used in the research, including their names, descriptions, and any relevant statistics.

As I identify datasets, I will take note of their names and any descriptions provided. For example, if the authors mention a dataset used for experiments, I will look for details such as the number of samples, types of data included, and any specific characteristics that define the dataset.

After gathering the necessary information, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily. I will ensure that I capture the authors, title, publication venue, and year for each dataset.

Once I have compiled the dataset names, descriptions, and citations, I will organize this information clearly. Each dataset entry will include:

1. **Dataset Name**: The official name of the dataset as mentioned in the paper.
2. **Description**: A brief overview of what the dataset contains, including any relevant statistics or characteristics.
3. **Full Citation**: The complete reference for the dataset as found in the References section of the paper.

Finally, I will ensure that all entries are formatted consistently and clearly, making it easy for readers to understand the datasets used in the research.

By following these steps, I will effectively extract and document the datasets referenced in the paper, ensuring that I include full citations for each dataset as required.
