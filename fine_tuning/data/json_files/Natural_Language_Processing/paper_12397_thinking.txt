To extract datasets from the research paper titled "FATRER: Full-Attention Topic Regularizer for Accurate and Robust Conversational Emotion Recognition" by Yuzhao Mao et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, and the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention the Emotion Recognition in Conversations (ERC) task and refer to various studies and datasets. However, I need to locate specific datasets used in their experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental setup section** (section 4), where the authors typically describe the datasets utilized for their experiments. Here, they explicitly mention four benchmark datasets:

1. **DailyDialog**: This dataset is referenced with a citation indicating it is a manually labeled multi-turn dialogue dataset. The citation is:
   > Yanran Li, Hui Su, Xiaoyu Shen, Wenjie Li, Ziqiang Cao, and Shuzi Niu. *DailyDialog: A Manually Labelled Multi-Turn Dialogue Dataset*. In Proceedings of the International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI), pages 986–995, 2017.

2. **IEMOCAP**: This dataset is described as an interactive emotional dyadic motion capture database. The citation is:
   > Carlos Busso, Murtaza Bulut, Chi-Chun Lee, et al. *IEMOCAP: Interactive Emotional Dyadic Motion Capture Database*. Language Resources and Evaluation, 42(4), 335, 2008.

3. **MELD**: This dataset is mentioned as a multimodal multi-party dataset for emotion recognition in conversations. The citation is:
   > Soujanya Poria, Devamanyu Hazarika, Navonil Majumder, et al. *MELD: A Multimodal Multi-Party Dataset for Emotion Recognition in Conversations*. In Proceedings of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL), pages 527–536, 2019.

4. **EmoryNLP**: This dataset is referenced for emotion detection in textual conversations. The citation is:
   > Sayyed M Zahiri and Jinho D Choi. *Emotion Detection on TV Show Transcripts with Sequence-Based Convolutional Neural Networks*. In AAAI Workshops, 2018.

After identifying these datasets, I will ensure to note their full citations as they are crucial for proper referencing.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including their names and citations, into a structured format for further processing or review. This will ensure that I have accurately captured all relevant details regarding the datasets used in the research paper.
