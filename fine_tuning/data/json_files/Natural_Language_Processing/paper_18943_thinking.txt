To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Mixed Q-Functionals: Advancing Value-Based Methods in Cooperative MARL with Continuous Action Domains" by Yasin Findik and S. Reza Ahmadzadeh, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and while it may not explicitly mention datasets, it sets the context for the experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4) where the authors describe the environments used for evaluation. In this section, they mention two distinct environments: **Multi-Agent Particle Environment (MPE)** and **Multi-Walker Environment (MWE)**. I will look for specific scenarios within these environments that may involve datasets.

In **Section 4.1 (Environments)**, the authors describe the scenarios in detail. They mention:

1. **Multi-Agent Particle Environment (MPE)**:
   - **Landmark Capturing**: Involves agents cooperating to cover landmarks.
   - **Predator-Prey**: A variation of the classic predator-prey game with two configurations.

2. **Multi-Walker Environment (MWE)**:
   - Describes a task where agents control legs of a walker to transport objects.

I will note that while these environments are described, they do not refer to traditional datasets like image or text datasets. Instead, they describe simulation environments where agents interact, which may not have a formal citation like a dataset would.

Next, I will check the **References section** to see if any datasets or environments are cited that could be considered datasets. The authors reference several foundational papers related to the environments and algorithms used, but they do not provide specific dataset citations as one would expect in a traditional dataset description.

Since the environments are based on existing frameworks (like OpenAI's MPE), I will look for the original sources of these environments to provide proper citations. For example, the MPE is referenced as being developed by Mordatch and Abbeel (2017), and the MWE is based on Gupta et al. (2017).

The citations I will compile are:

- For **Multi-Agent Particle Environment**:
  > Mordatch, I., & Abbeel, P. (2017). Emergence of grounded compositional language in multi-agent populations. *arXiv preprint arXiv:1703.04908*.

- For **Multi-Walker Environment**:
  > Gupta, J. K., Egorov, M., & Kochenderfer, M. J. (2017). Cooperative multi-agent control using deep reinforcement learning. In *Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems: AAMAS 2017 Workshops, Best Papers* (pp. 66-83). Springer.

Now, I will summarize the findings and prepare to present the dataset information, ensuring to include the full citations for the environments as they are the closest representation of datasets in this context.
