To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Curriculum Reinforcement Learning via Morphology-Environment Co-Evolution" by Shuang Ao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will look for any mentions of datasets used for experiments or evaluations. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets, which may help identify them.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as this is typically where authors describe the datasets they used for their evaluations. I will look for specific mentions of datasets, including their names, characteristics, and any relevant details about how they were utilized in the experiments.

In this paper, the authors mention conducting experiments in three environments: **2D locomotion, 3D locomotion, and Gap Crosser**. However, they do not explicitly name any datasets in the text. Instead, they describe the environments in which the experiments were conducted, which may imply the use of simulated datasets generated for these environments.

To ensure I have not missed any datasets, I will also check the **References section** for any cited works that may correspond to datasets or methodologies used in the experiments. If the authors reference specific datasets or prior works that include datasets, I will note those citations as well.

After gathering all the relevant information, I will compile the findings into a structured format, ensuring that I include full citations for any datasets or referenced works. If no specific datasets are mentioned, I will note that the experiments were conducted in simulated environments without explicit datasets.

Finally, I will summarize the findings, including any datasets identified and their corresponding citations, to provide a clear overview of the data sources used in the research.
