To extract datasets from the research paper titled "OPTiML: Dense Semantic Invariance Using Optimal Transport for Self-Supervised Medical Image Representation" by Azad Singh, Vandan Gorade, and Deepak Mishra, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experimental studies on three publicly available datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section IV (Experimental Platform)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention:

1. **NIH Chest X-ray Dataset**: This dataset contains 112,120 chest X-ray images labeled with 14 thoracic pathologies. This dataset is crucial for their self-supervised learning pre-training.

2. **VinBig-CXR Dataset**: This dataset consists of 18,000 chest X-ray images, annotated into 14 pathologies. It is used for evaluating the learned representations.

3. **RSNA Pneumonia Dataset**: This dataset includes 30,000 chest radiographs captured from a frontal view, each annotated as either healthy or pneumonia. It is also used for evaluation.

4. **SIIM-ACR Pneumothorax Dataset**: This dataset is mentioned for segmentation tasks as a downstream evaluation.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
