To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Large Language Models Are Neurosymbolic Reasoners" by Meng Fang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's focus on using LLMs in text-based games, which may indicate the presence of specific datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any explicit mentions of datasets or benchmarks. The authors discuss the challenges of symbolic reasoning in text-based games, which may lead to the identification of relevant datasets.

In the **experiments section**, I will look for detailed descriptions of the datasets used for testing the LLM agent's performance. The authors mention four text-based game benchmark environments: **Arithmetic, MapReader, Sorting, and Text World Common Sense (TWC)**. Each of these environments serves as a dataset for evaluating the LLM agent's capabilities in symbolic reasoning.

I will then check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. The citations will provide the necessary details for each dataset, including authors, titles, publication venues, and years.

1. **Arithmetic Dataset**: This dataset is used for mathematical tasks where the agent must solve arithmetic problems. The citation for the foundational work on this dataset is:
   > Wang, R., Jansen, P., Côté, M.-A., & Ammanabrolu, P. (2022b). Behavior Cloned Transformers are Neurosymbolic Reasoners. In Conference of the European Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics, 2777–2788.

2. **MapReader Dataset**: This dataset involves navigation tasks where the agent uses a map to optimize routes. The citation is:
   > Yuan, X., Côté, M.-A., Sordoni, A., Laroche, R., Combes, R. T. d., Hausknecht, M., & Trischler, A. (2018). Counting to explore and generalize in text-based games. arXiv preprint arXiv:1806.11525.

3. **Sorting Dataset**: This dataset is used for sorting tasks where the agent must arrange objects based on specific criteria. The citation is:
   > Wang, R., Jansen, P., Côté, M.-A., & Ammanabrolu, P. (2022a). ScienceWorld: Is your Agent Smarter than a 5th Grader? In Proceedings of the 2022 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, 11279–11298.

4. **Text World Common Sense (TWC) Dataset**: This dataset evaluates common sense reasoning abilities in agents. The citation is:
   > Murugesan, K., Atzeni, M., Kapanipathi, P., Shukla, P., Kumaravel, S., Tesauro, G., Talamadupula, K., Sachan, M., & Campbell, M. (2021). Text-based RL agents with common-sense knowledge: New challenges, environments and baselines. In Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, volume 35, 9018–9027.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with complete references. This structured approach will facilitate a clear understanding of the datasets utilized in the research.
