To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Investigating Transfer Learning in Multilingual Pre-trained Language Models through Chinese Natural Language Inference" by Hai Hu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors focus on the **OCNLI dataset** and mention the creation of **17 new datasets** for Chinese NLI tasks. This suggests that there are multiple datasets to extract.

Next, I will examine the **Methods** or **Dataset Creation** section, where the authors typically describe the datasets in detail. In this paper, the authors outline the **OCNLI dataset** and the **Chinese HANS dataset**, along with several other datasets created for their experiments. 

1. **OCNLI (Original Chinese Natural Language Inference)**: This is highlighted as a large-scale, human-annotated Chinese NLI dataset. The authors reference the original paper for this dataset:
   > Hu, H., Richardson, K., Xu, L., Li, L., KÃ¼bler, S., & Moss, L. (2020). OCNLI: Original Chinese Natural Language Inference. In Findings of EMNLP.

2. **Chinese HANS**: This dataset is derived from the English HANS dataset and is used to examine systematic biases in NLI. The authors mention it was inspired by the work of McCoy et al. (2019):
   > McCoy, R. T., Pavlick, E., & Linzen, T. (2019). Right for the Wrong Reasons: Diagnosing Syntactic Heuristics in Natural Language Inference. In Proceedings of ACL.

Additionally, the authors created **17 new datasets** categorized into challenge and adversarial tasks. They mention several specific datasets, including:

- **Distraction**: Built from patterns in OCNLI and XNLI-zh.
- **Antonym and Synonym datasets**: Created to test the model's understanding of these linguistic phenomena.
- **Numerical reasoning**: Based on the Ape210k dataset.

For each of these datasets, I will ensure to note their descriptions and the references provided in the paper. 

Next, I will check the **References section** to gather full citations for all datasets mentioned. This will include both the datasets created by the authors and any referenced datasets that they utilized in their experiments.

Finally, I will compile the extracted datasets along with their full citations into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and attributed to its source. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, which is essential for reproducibility and further research in the field.
