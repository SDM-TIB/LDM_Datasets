To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Accurate Block Quantization in LLMs with Outliers" by Nikita Trukhanov and Ilya Soloveychik, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the challenges of inference on large-scale LLMs and mentions quantization techniques, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. 

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any references to datasets used in the experiments. The introduction primarily discusses the architecture and challenges of LLMs without naming specific datasets.

Moving on to the **experiments section (Section IV)**, I will look for any datasets used for empirical validation. The authors mention using the **Llama2-7B-hf model** and refer to the **wikitext-2 dataset** for evaluating perplexity. This indicates that the wikitext-2 dataset is relevant to their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the wikitext-2 dataset. The references do not provide a specific citation for wikitext-2, but I know from external sources that it is commonly cited as follows:

- For **wikitext-2**, the citation is:
  > Merity, S., Xiong, C., Bradbury, J., & Socher, R. (2016). Pointer sentinel mixture models. *arXiv preprint arXiv:1609.07843*.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format.

In summary, the only dataset extracted from this paper is the **wikitext-2 dataset**, and I will ensure to include its full citation in the final output.
