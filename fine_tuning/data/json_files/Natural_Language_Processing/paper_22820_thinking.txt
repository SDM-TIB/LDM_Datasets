To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MAMBA4D: Efficient Long-Sequence Point Cloud Video Understanding with Disentangled Spatial-Temporal State Space Models" by Jiuming Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that experimental results were demonstrated on **MSR-Action3D dataset** and **Synthia 4D dataset**, indicating that these datasets are crucial for the research.

Next, I will look for more detailed descriptions of these datasets in the **experiments section**. In **section 5.1**, the authors explicitly state that they evaluate their method on the **MSR-Action3D dataset** for action recognition. They mention the dataset's characteristics, such as the partitioning of train/test sets and the specific settings used during evaluation.

In **section 5.2**, the authors discuss the **Synthia 4D dataset** for 4D semantic segmentation, providing insights into how their method performs on this dataset and comparing it with other methods.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **MSR-Action3D dataset**, the citation is:
  > Wanqing Li, Zhengyou Zhang, and Zicheng Liu. *Action recognition based on a bag of 3D points*. In 2010 IEEE computer society conference on computer vision and pattern recognition-workshops, pages 9–14. IEEE, 2010.

- For **Synthia 4D dataset**, the citation is:
  > Christopher Choy, JunYoung Gwak, and Silvio Savarese. *4D spatio-temporal convnets: Minkowski convolutional neural networks*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pages 3075–3084, 2019.

Having gathered the necessary information, I will now compile the dataset entries with their respective citations for further processing.
