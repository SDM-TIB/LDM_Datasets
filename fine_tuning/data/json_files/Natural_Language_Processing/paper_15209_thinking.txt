To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Interaction-Driven Active 3D Reconstruction with Object Interiors" by Zihao Yan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and it may contain hints about the datasets used.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as this is typically where authors describe the datasets they used for their evaluations. In this paper, the authors mention using the **PartNet-Mobility dataset** for training and testing their method. I will look for specific details about this dataset, such as its size, structure, and any unique characteristics that are relevant to the study.

In the **experiments section**, the authors state that they selected seven categories from the PartNet-Mobility dataset, which contains a total of 434 shapes and 827 parts. This information is crucial for understanding the dataset's scope and application in their research.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the PartNet-Mobility dataset. The citation is essential for proper attribution and to allow others to access the dataset. The reference for the PartNet-Mobility dataset is:
> Xiang, F., Qin, Y., Mo, K., Xia, Y., Zhu, H., Liu, F., Liu, M., Jiang, H., Yuan, Y., Wang, H., Yi, L., Chang, A. X., Guibas, L. J., & Su, H. (2020). SAPIEN: A SimulAted Part-based Interactive ENvironment. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 11094â€“11104.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset details, including the name, description, and citation, into a structured format for clarity and ease of use.

In summary, the steps I will take are:
1. Read the abstract and introduction for initial dataset mentions.
2. Examine the experiments section for detailed descriptions of datasets used.
3. Identify the PartNet-Mobility dataset and its characteristics.
4. Retrieve the full citation from the references section.
5. Compile the dataset information for documentation.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets referenced in the paper.
