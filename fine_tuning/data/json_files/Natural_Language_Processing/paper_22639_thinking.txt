To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Hierarchical Attention Graph for Scientific Document Summarization in Global and Local Level" by Chenlong Zhao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors validate their approach on **two benchmark datasets**, which indicates that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors reference the challenges of summarizing long scientific documents and mention that they validate their model on two datasets. This suggests that the datasets are significant to their research.

In the **experiments section**, specifically in **section 4.1**, the authors explicitly list the datasets used for validation: **Arxiv** and **PubMed**. They provide some statistics about these datasets, such as the number of documents, training, validation, and test splits, which confirms their relevance.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The paper cites the original work that introduced these datasets:

1. For the **Arxiv dataset**, the citation is:
   > Arman Cohan, Franck Dernoncourt, Doo Soon Kim, Trung Bui, Seokhwan Kim, Walter Chang, and Nazli Goharian. *A discourse-aware attention model for abstractive summarization of long documents*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1804.05685, 2018.

2. For the **PubMed dataset**, the citation is:
   > Arman Cohan, Franck Dernoncourt, Doo Soon Kim, Trung Bui, Seokhwan Kim, Walter Chang, and Nazli Goharian. *A discourse-aware attention model for abstractive summarization of long documents*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1804.05685, 2018.

Although both datasets are mentioned in the same citation, I will ensure to note that they are distinct datasets used in the experiments.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for both datasets as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research.
