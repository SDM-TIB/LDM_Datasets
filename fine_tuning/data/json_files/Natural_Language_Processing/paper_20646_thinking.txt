To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-Review Fusion-in-Context" by Aviv Slobodkin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and dataset sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the development of a curated dataset of 1000 instances in the reviews domain, which indicates that a dataset is indeed present.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Dataset for FiC)**, where the authors describe the dataset in detail. Here, they mention that the dataset is constructed via controlled crowdsourcing and consists of 1000 instances, each comprising a set of inputs with highlights and a corresponding fused text. This section is crucial as it provides specifics about the dataset's creation and its intended use.

In **subsection 4.1 (Dataset Collection)**, the authors specify the sources of their dataset. They mention leveraging existing multi-document summarization datasets, specifically in the business reviews domain, and cite two datasets used for this purpose:

1. **CocoTrip**: A dataset of comparative opinion summaries of hotel review sets.
2. **FewSum**: A dataset consisting of summaries of review sets on businesses.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **CocoTrip**, the citation is:
  > Hayate Iso, Xiaolan Wang, Stefanos Angelidis, and Yoshihiko Suhara. *Comparative Opinion Summarization via Collaborative Decoding*. In Findings of the Association for Computational Linguistics: ACL 2022, pages 3307–3324.

- For **FewSum**, the citation is:
  > Arthur Bražinskas, Mirella Lapata, and Ivan Titov. *Few-shot learning for opinion summarization*. In Proceedings of the 2020 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), pages 4119–4135.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and future reference.

In summary, the datasets extracted from the paper are:

1. **CocoTrip**: A dataset of comparative opinion summaries of hotel review sets.
   - Citation: Hayate Iso, Xiaolan Wang, Stefanos Angelidis, and Yoshihiko Suhara. *Comparative Opinion Summarization via Collaborative Decoding*. In Findings of the Association for Computational Linguistics: ACL 2022, pages 3307–3324.

2. **FewSum**: A dataset consisting of summaries of review sets on businesses.
   - Citation: Arthur Bražinskas, Mirella Lapata, and Ivan Titov. *Few-shot learning for opinion summarization*. In Proceedings of the 2020 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), pages 4119–4135.

With this information, I am ready to present the datasets in the required format for further analysis or processing.
