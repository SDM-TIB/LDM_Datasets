To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The Mechanical Turkness: Tactical Media Art and the Critique of Corporate AI" by Dejan Grba, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned throughout the text.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned or referenced. The abstract discusses the socio-political implications of AI and art practices but does not explicitly mention any datasets. The introduction continues this theme without naming specific datasets.

Next, I will examine the **main body of the paper**, particularly focusing on sections that discuss specific art projects or methodologies. I will look for any references to datasets used in the context of the artworks or critiques presented. For instance, the paper discusses various artists and their works, some of which may involve datasets for training AI models or for analysis.

As I read through the sections, I will pay close attention to any mention of **crowdsourced labor platforms** like Amazon's Mechanical Turk (MTurk), as these platforms often involve datasets created from user interactions. The paper discusses MTurk extensively, highlighting its role in data collection and the ethical implications of using such datasets in AI development.

I will also check the **References section** to find any citations related to datasets or studies that may have utilized specific datasets. This is crucial for providing full citations for any datasets mentioned.

If I identify any datasets, I will ensure to document them with the following details:
1. **Dataset Name**: The official name of the dataset.
2. **Description**: A brief overview of what the dataset contains and its purpose.
3. **Full Citation**: The complete reference for the dataset, including authors, title, publication venue, and year.

For example, if I find a dataset related to MTurk, I would document it as follows:
- **Dataset Name**: Amazon Mechanical Turk Dataset
- **Description**: A dataset comprising tasks completed by workers on the MTurk platform, often used for training machine learning models.
- **Full Citation**: [Author(s)]. *Title of the dataset or related study*. Year. [Link or publication details].

After gathering all relevant datasets and their citations, I will compile them into a structured format for easy reference and ensure that each dataset is accurately represented with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets discussed in the paper and their significance in the context of AI and art.
