To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards CausalGPT: A Multi-Agent Approach for Faithful Knowledge Reasoning via Promoting Causal Consistency in LLMs" by Ziyi Tang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, experiments, and related work sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions "extensive and comprehensive evaluations on a variety of knowledge reasoning tasks," which suggests that datasets may be involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as this is typically where datasets are explicitly listed. In this section, the authors mention three datasets used for evaluation:

1. **ScienceQA**: This dataset is described as a multimodal multiple-choice dataset with approximately 21,000 questions, annotated with image and text context. It is split into train/validation/test sets with a ratio of 60:20:20.

2. **Com2Sense**: This dataset consists of 4,000 sentence pairs annotated with true or false labels, aimed at evaluating commonsense reasoning capabilities.

3. **BoolQ**: This reading comprehension dataset contains 16,000 questions paired with paragraphs from Wikipedia, annotated as containing the answer. It is split into a 3.2k dev set, a 3.2k test set, and a 9.4k train set.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution:

- For **ScienceQA**, the citation is:
  > Lu, P., Mishra, S., Xia, T., Qiu, L., Chang, K.-W., Zhu, S.-C., Tafjord, O., Clark, P., and Kalyan, A. (2022). *Learn to Explain: Multimodal Reasoning via Thought Chains for Science Question Answering*. In The 36th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS).

- For **Com2Sense**, the citation is:
  > Singh, S., Wen, N., Hou, Y., Alipoormolabashi, P., Wu, T.-L., Ma, X., and Peng, N. (2021). *COM2SENSE: A commonsense reasoning benchmark with complementary sentences*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2106.00969.

- For **BoolQ**, the citation is:
  > Clark, C., Lee, K., Chang, M.-W., Kwiatkowski, T., Collins, M., and Toutanova, K. (2019). *BoolQ: Exploring the surprising difficulty of natural yes/no questions*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1905.10044.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
