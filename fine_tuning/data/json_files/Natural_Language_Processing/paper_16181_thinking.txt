To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Robust and Accurate Visual Prompting" by Qi Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and method sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions "extensive experiments across various datasets," which indicates that multiple datasets are likely involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors detail the datasets used for their experiments. They mention evaluating their proposed method on **eight downstream datasets**: 

1. **Flowers102 (F-102)**: This dataset is used for flower classification and contains images of various flower species.
2. **DTD (Describable Textures Dataset)**: A dataset for texture classification, containing images of different textures.
3. **SVHN (Street View House Numbers)**: A dataset for digit recognition, consisting of images of house numbers from Google Street View.
4. **GTSRB (German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark)**: A dataset for traffic sign recognition, containing images of various traffic signs.
5. **EuroSAT**: A dataset for land use and land cover classification, derived from Sentinel-2 satellite images.
6. **OxfordPets**: A dataset for pet classification, containing images of cats and dogs.
7. **StanfordCars**: A dataset for fine-grained classification of car models.
8. **CIFAR100**: A dataset containing 100 classes of images for general object recognition.

In the **experimental settings section**, the authors provide additional context about the datasets, confirming their use in the experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

With all this information gathered, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
