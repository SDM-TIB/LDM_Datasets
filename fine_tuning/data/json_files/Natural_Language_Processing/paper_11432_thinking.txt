To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Sociodemographic Bias in Language Models: A Survey and Forward Path" by Vipul Gupta et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets along with their full citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections that discuss datasets** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a general overview of the paper's focus on sociodemographic bias in language models, but I need to look for specific datasets in the main body of the text.

Next, I will focus on **section A.1 (Evaluation Datasets)**, where the authors summarize various datasets used for measuring bias in NLP models. This section is likely to contain the most relevant information regarding the datasets.

In this section, I will identify each dataset mentioned, along with the corresponding details such as the task it is used for, the type of bias it addresses, and its size. The datasets listed include:

1. **WinoBias**: Used for coreference resolution, addressing gender bias, with a size of 1,580 examples. Citation: Zhao et al. (2018a).

2. **WinoGender**: Also for coreference resolution, focusing on gender bias, with 720 examples. Citation: Rudinger et al. (2018).

3. **GAP**: A gender-balanced corpus for coreference resolution, containing 8,908 examples. Citation: Webster et al. (2018).

4. **Counter-GAP**: Another coreference resolution dataset with 4,008 examples, focusing on gender bias. Citation: Xie et al. (2023).

5. **CrowS-Pairs**: A word association dataset measuring bias across various sociodemographic groups, with 1,508 examples. Citation: Nangia et al. (2020).

6. **StereoSet**: A large-scale dataset for measuring stereotypical bias, containing 16,995 examples. Citation: Nadeem et al. (2021).

7. **WikiGenderBias**: A dataset for measuring gender bias, with 45,000 examples. Citation: Gaut et al. (2020).

8. **UnQOVER**: A dataset for probing bias in question answering models, with 8,908 examples. Citation: Li et al. (2020).

9. **WinoGrande**: A dataset for coreference resolution with 1,767 examples. Citation: Sakaguchi et al. (2021).

10. **BBQ**: A hand-built bias benchmark for question answering, with a total of 58,492 examples across various sociodemographic groups. Citation: Parrish et al. (2022b).

11. **EEC**: A sentiment evaluation dataset with 8,640 examples, focusing on gender and race bias. Citation: Kiritchenko and Mohammad (2018).

12. **BITS**: A dataset for measuring bias in sentiment and toxicity analysis models, containing 1,126 examples. Citation: Venkit and Wilson (2021).

13. **HolisticBias**: A dataset with 450,000 unique sentence prompts for measuring 13 types of sociodemographic bias in generative language models. Citation: Smith et al. (2022).

After identifying these datasets, I will ensure to retrieve their full citations from the **References section** of the paper. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the context of the research.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including their names, tasks, bias types, sizes, and citations, into a structured format for easy reference and further analysis.
