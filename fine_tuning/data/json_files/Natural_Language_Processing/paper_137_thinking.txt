To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Joint Aspect and Polarity Classification for Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis with End-to-End Neural Networks" by Martin Schmitt et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments using the **GermEval 2017 dataset**, which is a strong lead for dataset extraction.

Next, I will look closely at the **introduction** to see if there are any additional details about the dataset. The introduction mentions that they evaluate their approach on the GermEval 2017 data, specifically customer reviews about Deutsche Bahn AG on social media. This confirms the dataset's relevance.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide more context about the GermEval 2017 dataset, stating that it consists of about 26,000 documents divided into training, development, and test sets. They also mention that the data were manually annotated, which adds to the dataset's credibility and usability.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the GermEval 2017 dataset. The relevant citation is:

- For **GermEval 2017 dataset**:
  > Michael Wojatzki, Eugen Ruppert, Sarah Holschneider, Torsten Zesch, and Chris Biemann. *GermEval 2017: Shared Task on Aspect-based Sentiment in Social Media Customer Feedback*. In Proceedings of the GermEval 2017 – Shared Task on Aspect-based Sentiment in Social Media Customer Feedback, pages 1–12, Berlin, Germany, 2017.

Since the paper primarily focuses on the GermEval 2017 dataset, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity.

After gathering all necessary details, I will prepare the dataset entry for the GermEval 2017 dataset, ensuring that the citation is included for proper attribution.
