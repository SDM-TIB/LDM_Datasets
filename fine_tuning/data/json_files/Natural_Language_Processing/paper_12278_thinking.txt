To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Federated Learning for Computationally-Constrained Heterogeneous Devices: A Survey" by Kilian Pfeiffer et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and relevant sections** of the paper to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a high-level overview, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the research, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the methodology or experiments sections. In this paper, the authors discuss various applications of federated learning, and they may reference specific datasets used in their examples or cited studies.

I will also check the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets.

Upon reviewing the paper, I note the following datasets mentioned:

1. **PM2.5 IoT Sensor Network**: This dataset is referenced in the context of training models for anomaly detection in air quality monitoring. The authors discuss its relevance to federated learning in heterogeneous environments.

2. **EMNIST/MNIST**: These datasets are mentioned in the context of federated learning techniques that utilize model distillation. They are well-known datasets for handwritten digit recognition and character classification.

3. **CIFAR10/100**: These datasets are also referenced in relation to federated learning methods that allow for heterogeneous architectures. They are commonly used for image classification tasks.

Now, I will compile the full citations for these datasets from the references section:

- For the **PM2.5 IoT Sensor Network**, the citation is:
  > Ling-Jyh Chen, Yao-Hua Ho, Hsin-Hung Hsieh, Shih-Ting Huang, Hu-Cheng Lee, and Sachit Mahajan. *ADF: An Anomaly Detection Framework for Large-Scale PM2.5 Sensing Systems*. IEEE Internet of Things Journal 5, 2 (2018), 559–570. https://doi.org/10.1109/JIOT.2017.2766085

- For the **EMNIST/MNIST**, the citation is:
  > Gregory Cohen, Saeed Afshar, Jonathan Tapson, and André van Schaik. *EMNIST: an extension of MNIST to handwritten letters*. arXiv:1702.05373 [cs.CV].

- For the **CIFAR10/100**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton, et al. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. 

After gathering this information, I will ensure that each dataset is clearly documented with its full citation, ready for inclusion in any structured output or further analysis.
