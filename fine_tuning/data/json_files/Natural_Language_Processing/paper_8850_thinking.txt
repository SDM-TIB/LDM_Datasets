To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Lateral Strain Imaging using Self-supervised and Physically Inspired Constraints in Unsupervised Regularized Elastography" by Ali K. Z. Tehrani et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention the use of ultrasound elastography and refer to various applications, but I need to look for specific datasets. I will pay close attention to any sections that describe experiments or evaluations, as these often include dataset details.

Next, I will focus on the **datasets section (2.6)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention three datasets:

1. **Simulation Data**: This dataset is generated using Field II and ABAQUS software, with specific parameters for the phantom's Poisson's ratio and Young's modulus. The authors note that they used 1200 pairs of publicly available simulated phantoms for training and 70 pairs for evaluation.

2. **Experimental Phantom Data**: This dataset consists of RF data collected from a tissue-mimicking breast phantom. The authors specify the equipment used for data collection and the characteristics of the phantom, including its Young's modulus.

3. **In Vivo Data**: This dataset is acquired from patients with liver cancer during surgical RF thermal ablation. The authors mention the equipment used and the number of RF frame pairs selected for training and testing.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The citations may not always be directly provided for datasets, but I will look for the original sources or related studies that describe these datasets.

For the **Simulation Data**, the citation is:
> A. K. Tehrani and H. Rivaz. *Displacement estimation in ultrasound elastography using pyramidal convolutional neural network*. IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control, vol. 67, no. 12, pp. 2629â€“2639, 2020.

For the **Experimental Phantom Data**, the citation is:
> CIRS: Tissue Simulation & Phantom Technology. *Model 059*. Norfolk, VA.

For the **In Vivo Data**, the citation is:
> Johns Hopkins Hospital. *Research Antares Siemens system*. 

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited according to the format required.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ready for further processing or review.
