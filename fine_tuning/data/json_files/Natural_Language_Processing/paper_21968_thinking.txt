To extract datasets from the research paper titled "One-Shot Image Restoration" by Deborah Pereg, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to find any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the applicability of the proposed approach for image deblurring and super-resolution, which suggests that datasets may be involved in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically looking for any explicit mentions of datasets used for training or testing. In this section, the author states that the RNN and RNN-GAN were trained using specific images, such as the Lena and Peppers color images, and that the UNET-GAN was trained with the same images. This indicates that these images are part of the datasets used.

Additionally, the paper mentions two known datasets for testing: **Set11** and **BSD500**. I will gather details about these datasets, including their purpose and any relevant characteristics mentioned in the paper.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **Set11**, the citation is:
  > Z. Wang, A. C. Bovik, H. R. Sheikh, and E. P. Simoncelli. *Image Quality Assessment: From Error Visibility to Structural Similarity*. IEEE Transactions on Image Processing, 13(4):600–612, 2004.

- For **BSD500**, the citation is:
  > D. Martin, C. Fowlkes, D. Tal, and J. Malik. *A Database of Human Segmented Natural Images and its Application to Evaluating Segmentation Algorithms and Measuring Ecological Statistics*. In Proceedings of the Eighth IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 416–423, 2001.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
