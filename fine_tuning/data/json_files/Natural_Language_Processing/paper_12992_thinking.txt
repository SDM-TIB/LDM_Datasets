To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Latent Random Steps as Relaxations of Max-Cut, Min-Cut, and More" by Sudhanshu Chanpuriya and Cameron Musco, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a general overview, but I need to look for specific references to datasets in the subsequent sections.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss their model and its applications but do not mention specific datasets yet. I will move on to the **methodology** and **experiments sections** where datasets are more likely to be detailed.

In **section 4 (Experiments on Real-World Networks)**, the authors describe two datasets constructed from English-language data:

1. **Orthographic Adjacency Graph**: This dataset is based on the spellings of common English words, where nodes correspond to letters and edge weights represent the frequency of adjacency between letters in the 20K most frequently-used English words.

2. **Phonological Adjacency Graph**: This dataset is constructed from the pronunciations of English words, using the same list of common words. Nodes correspond to phonemes, and edge weights represent the frequency of adjacency between phonemes as determined by the CMU Pronouncing Dictionary.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The authors reference the source of the word list and the phoneme dictionary:

- For the **20K most frequently-used English words**, the citation is:
  > Google Books Ngram Viewer. *Google Books Ngram Viewer*. [Online resource].

- For the **CMU Pronouncing Dictionary**, the citation is:
  > Carnegie Mellon University. *CMU Pronouncing Dictionary*. [Online resource].

Now that I have identified the datasets and their sources, I will compile the dataset entries with their full citations.

Finally, I will ensure that the dataset information is clearly structured and ready for any further processing or review.
