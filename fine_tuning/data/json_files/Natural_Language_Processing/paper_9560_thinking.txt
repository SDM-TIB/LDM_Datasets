To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Optimization of Cryptocurrency Minersâ€™ Participation in Ancillary Service Markets" by Ali Menati et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for simulations or analysis.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments or results section** of the paper, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their analysis in detail. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and any relevant characteristics.

In this paper, the authors mention using **real-world Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) traces** for their simulations. This indicates that there is a dataset related to ERCOT that is crucial for their analysis.

I will also check the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. This is important for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

For the ERCOT dataset, I will note the following citation:
- **ERCOT Historical Records**: The dataset is referenced in the paper as being publicly available, but I will need to provide a citation that points to the ERCOT public database where the data can be accessed.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This will ensure that the datasets are well-documented and can be easily referenced by others.

Finally, I will summarize the findings in a structured format, ready for further processing or review.
