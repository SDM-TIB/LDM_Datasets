To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Anticipatory Music Transformer" by John Thickstun et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the use of the **Lakh MIDI music dataset**, which is a strong indication that this dataset is central to the research.

Next, I will look for specific sections that detail the datasets used, particularly focusing on any sections that explicitly mention datasets, such as **section 4 (Experiments)** or any dedicated **Datasets section**. In this paper, the authors describe the **Lakh MIDI dataset** in detail, noting that it consists of 178,561 MIDI files and encompasses 8943 hours of music. This section provides a comprehensive overview of the dataset's characteristics, including its size and the nature of the data it contains.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Lakh MIDI dataset. The citation is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the dataset. The citation for the Lakh MIDI dataset is as follows:
> Colin Raffel, *Learning-based methods for comparing sequences, with applications to audio-to-midi alignment and matching*. Columbia University, 2016.

Now, I will summarize the findings for the dataset:

1. **Lakh MIDI Dataset**: This dataset is used for training the anticipatory infilling models. It contains 178,561 MIDI files, which were preprocessed into 663,555,310 events, amounting to 8943 hours of music.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines the dataset and its citation, ensuring that all necessary details are included for future reference or analysis.
