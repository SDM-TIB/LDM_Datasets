To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Synthetic Face Ageing: Evaluation, Analysis and Facilitation of Age-Robust Facial Recognition Algorithms" by Wang Yao et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the research involves synthetic ageing data and real ageing data, which suggests that datasets are likely included.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of obtaining large-scale datasets for age-invariant face recognition. They mention the need for datasets that cover a wide age range, which implies that specific datasets may be referenced later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly where the authors describe the datasets used. They explicitly mention two datasets:

1. **CelebA-HQ Dataset**: This dataset consists of 30,000 high-quality images of faces at a resolution of 1024 × 1024, featuring approximately 6,000 unique identities. It is derived from the CelebA dataset and is used as a baseline for generating synthetic ageing data.

2. **B3FD Dataset**: This dataset merges two large web-based datasets (IMDB-WIKI and CACD) and contains 375,592 images with 53,759 unique subjects. It is focused on cleaning web-scraped facial datasets and includes age labels ranging from 0 to 100.

In the **results section**, the authors discuss the performance of their models using these datasets, confirming their relevance to the experiments conducted.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **CelebA-HQ Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Liu, Z., Luo, P., Wang, X., & Tang, X. (2015). *Deep learning face attributes in the wild*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), December 2015.

- For the **B3FD Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Beˇseni´c, K., Ahlberg, J., & Pandˇzi´c, I. S. (2022). *Picking out the bad apples: unsupervised biometric data filtering for refined age estimation*. The Visual Computer, pp. 1–19.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **CelebA-HQ Dataset**: A high-quality face dataset derived from CelebA, comprising 30,000 images of 1024 × 1024 resolution faces featuring approximately 6,000 unique identities.
   - Citation: Liu, Z., Luo, P., Wang, X., & Tang, X. (2015). *Deep learning face attributes in the wild*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), December 2015.

2. **B3FD Dataset**: A dataset that merges two large web-based datasets (IMDB-WIKI and CACD) and contains 375,592 images with 53,759 unique subjects, focused on cleaning web-scraped facial datasets.
   - Citation: Beˇseni´c, K., Ahlberg, J., & Pandˇzi´c, I. S. (2022). *Picking out the bad apples: unsupervised biometric data filtering for refined age estimation*. The Visual Computer, pp. 1–19.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
