To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DetToolChain: A New Prompting Paradigm to Unleash Detection Ability of MLLM" by Yixuan Wu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract highlights the effectiveness of the proposed method across various detection tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved, but I need to find specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they mention several benchmarks, including:

1. **MS COCO 2017**: This dataset is widely used for object detection tasks and is mentioned as a benchmark for evaluating the proposed method. The authors report results on the validation subset of this dataset.

2. **D-cube dataset**: This dataset is used for described object detection, which involves confirming the presence of objects described in arbitrary open-set expressions.

3. **RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, and RefCOCOg**: These datasets are used for referring expression comprehension, which requires grounding a referent based on a given expression.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **MS COCO**, the citation is:
  > Lin, T.Y., Maire, M., Belongie, S., Hays, J., Perona, P., Ramanan, D., Dollár, P., Zitnick, C.L. (2014). *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. In Computer Vision–ECCV 2014: 13th European Conference, Zurich, Switzerland, September 6-12, 2014, Proceedings, Part V 13. pp. 740–755. Springer.

- For **D-cube**, the citation is:
  > Wu, Y., Zhang, Z., Xie, C., Zhu, F., Zhao, R. (2024). *Described Object Detection: Liberating Object Detection with Flexible Expressions*. Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 36.

- For **RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, and RefCOCOg**, the citation is:
  > Yu, L., Poirson, P., Yang, S., Berg, A.C., Berg, T.L. (2016). *Modeling Context in Referring Expressions*. In Computer Vision–ECCV 2016: 14th European Conference, Amsterdam, The Netherlands, October 11-14, 2016, Proceedings, Part II 14. pp. 69–85. Springer.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets referenced in the paper along with their full citations.
