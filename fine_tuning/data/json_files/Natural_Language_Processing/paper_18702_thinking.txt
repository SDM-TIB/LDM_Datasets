To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SEABO: A Simple Search-Based Method for Offline Imitation Learning" by Jiafei Lyu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses experimental results on a variety of **D4RL datasets**, which indicates that there are datasets involved, but I need to find specific names and details.

Next, I will move to the **introduction** section. Here, the authors mention that their method achieves competitive performance on D4RL datasets, which suggests that these datasets are crucial for their experiments. I will look for any specific dataset names mentioned.

In the **experiments section**, particularly in **section 5**, the authors detail their empirical evaluations. They mention using several D4RL datasets, specifically:

1. **halfcheetah-medium-expert-v2**
2. **hopper-medium-v2**
3. **walker2d-medium-v2**
4. **halfcheetah-medium-replay-v2**
5. **hopper-medium-replay-v2**
6. **walker2d-medium-replay-v2**
7. **halfcheetah-medium-expert-v2**
8. **hopper-medium-expert-v2**
9. **walker2d-medium-expert-v2**
10. **AntMaze** and **Adroit** datasets.

The authors also refer to the **D4RL** benchmark, which is a collection of datasets for deep reinforcement learning. 

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The D4RL datasets are typically referenced in the following way:

- For the D4RL datasets, the citation is:
  > Justin Fu, Aviral Kumar, Ofir Nachum, G. Tucker, and Sergey Levine. *D4RL: Datasets for Deep Data-Driven Reinforcement Learning*. ArXiv, abs/2004.07219, 2020.

Next, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. 

Finally, I will summarize the findings in a structured format, ensuring clarity and completeness for each dataset extracted from the paper.
