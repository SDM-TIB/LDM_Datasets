To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Visual Captioning at Will: Describing Images and Videos Guided by a Few Stylized Sentences" by Dingyi Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, and the introduction often highlights the datasets used in the context of the study.

Next, I will specifically look for a section that discusses datasets, which in this case is **section 4.1 (Datasets)**. Here, the authors explicitly list the datasets they utilized for their experiments. 

The datasets mentioned in this section are:

1. **MSCOCO**: This dataset is used for image captioning tasks and is described as containing 113,287 images for training, with 5,000 images each for validation and testing. Each image has 5 captions.

2. **MSR-VTT**: This dataset is utilized for video captioning tasks and includes 6,513 videos for training, 497 for validation, and 2,990 for testing, with each video containing 20 captions.

3. **Personality-Captions**: This dataset serves as the unlabeled textual training corpus and contains sentences conditioned on possible personality traits, with a total of 136,894 training and 3,683 validation examples after preprocessing.

4. **SentiCap**: This dataset is used to evaluate the results of stylized image captioning and is derived from the MSCOCO dataset, containing images labeled with three positive and three negative captions.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

- **SentiCap**:
  > Alexander Mathews, Lexing Xie, and Xuming He. *SentiCap: Generating Image Descriptions with Sentiments*. In Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, 2016.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
