To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A classification model based on a population of hypergraphs" by Samuel Barton et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract indicates that the algorithm is evaluated on two datasets, which suggests that I should look for their names and details.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Case Studies)**, where the authors discuss the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they mention two datasets:

1. **Fisher’s Iris Dataset**: This dataset is well-known in the fields of machine learning and statistics, containing measurements of four features from three species of iris flowers. The authors provide a summary of the dataset, including the number of units and features.

2. **Starch Grain Dataset**: This dataset consists of representative information for starch grains from seven distinct species, described by 16 morphological features. The authors mention that the dataset is based on personal communication from the authors of a referenced paper.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **Fisher’s Iris Dataset**, the citation is:
  > R. A. Fisher. *The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems*. Annal. Eugen., 7(2):179–188, 1936.

- For **Starch Grain Dataset**, the citation is:
  > A. C. Coster and J. H. Field. *What starch grain is that?–a geometric morphometric approach to determining plant species origin*. Journal of Archaeological Science, 58:9–25, 2015.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This includes ensuring that the full citations are accurately represented for each dataset.
