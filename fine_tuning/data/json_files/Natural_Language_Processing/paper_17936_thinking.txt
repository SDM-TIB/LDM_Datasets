To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Survey of Resource-Efficient LLM and Multimodal Foundation Models" by Mengwei Xu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. These sections often provide a high-level overview of the research and may mention key datasets used in the study. I will look for any explicit references to datasets or benchmarks.

Next, I will review the **methodology** and **experiments** sections, as these typically contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used for training and evaluation. I will pay close attention to any subsections that specifically discuss datasets, such as "Datasets" or "Data Collection."

As I read through these sections, I will take note of any datasets mentioned, including their names, descriptions, and any relevant statistics (e.g., number of samples, types of data). I will also look for any figures or tables that summarize the datasets used in the experiments.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** of the paper to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like "ImageNet," I will look for its full citation, which might include the authors, title, conference or journal name, and publication year.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research.

Finally, I will organize the extracted information clearly, making it easy to understand and reference for future use.
