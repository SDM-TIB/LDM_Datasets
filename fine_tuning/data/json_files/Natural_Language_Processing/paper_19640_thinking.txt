To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Look Before You Leap: Towards Decision-Aware and Generalizable Tool-Usage for Large Language Models" by Anchun Gui et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the construction of a tool-usage framework and mentions "extensive experiments" but does not specify datasets yet.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors highlight the limitations of existing methods and the need for a new framework. They mention that their experiments demonstrate effectiveness across various datasets, which indicates that specific datasets will be detailed later.

In the **methodology section**, I will look for any explicit mention of datasets used for training or evaluation. The authors describe constructing a dataset with diverse branches for tool-usage scenarios. They mention collecting 977 tools and constructing 8,650 samples based on 900 randomly selected tools, but I need to find specific dataset names.

In **section 4.1 (Experiments)**, the authors provide detailed statistics about their datasets. They mention constructing a total of 8,650 samples for training, with 3,460 samples for NoCall and 5,190 for Call scenarios. They also mention a test set of 743 samples based on 77 additional tools not involved in training. However, they do not provide specific dataset names here.

I will then check the **references section** to find any citations related to datasets. The authors reference two datasets: **ToolBench** and **ToolCorpus**. 

The full citations for these datasets are:

- For **ToolBench**:
  > Qin, Y., Hu, S., Lin, Y., et al. (2023). *ToolBench: A Benchmark for Tool-Augmented LLMs*. arXiv:2304.08354.

- For **ToolCorpus**:
  > Tang, Q., Deng, Z., Lin, H., et al. (2023). *ToolCorpus: A Dataset for LLM Question Answering with External Tools*. arXiv:2306.13304.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets used in the research.
