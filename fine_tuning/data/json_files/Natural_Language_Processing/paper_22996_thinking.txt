To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Mamba4KT: An Efficient and Effective Mamba-based Knowledge Tracing Model" by Yang Cao and Wei Zhang, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments across three public datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they list three datasets:

1. **ASSISTments 2012**: This dataset consists of several datasets collected from the ASSISTments platform, which is an online tutoring system providing math instruction. The statistics provided include:
   - Number of questions: 53,070
   - Number of concepts: 265
   - Number of interactions: 2,709,647
   - Average length: 99

2. **ASSISTments 2017**: Similar to the 2012 dataset, this dataset is also from the ASSISTments platform. The statistics are:
   - Number of questions: 3,162
   - Number of concepts: 102
   - Number of interactions: 942,814
   - Average length: 552

3. **Eedi**: This dataset contains student responses to math questions collected over two school years (2018-2020) from the Eedi platform, which is a free homework and teaching platform for primary and secondary schools in the UK. The statistics are:
   - Number of questions: 948
   - Number of concepts: 57
   - Number of interactions: 1,399,520
   - Average length: 284

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. However, the datasets themselves are not typically cited in the references; instead, they are described in the text. Therefore, I will provide the citations for the papers that describe the ASSISTments datasets and the Eedi dataset based on the context provided in the paper.

For the **ASSISTments datasets**, I will cite:
- **ASSISTments 2012**: 
  > "ASSISTments 2012-13 School Data with Affect." Available at: https://sites.google.com/site/assistmentsdata/home/2012-13-school-data-with-affect.

- **ASSISTments 2017**: 
  > "ASSISTments Data Mining." Available at: https://sites.google.com/view/assistmentsdatamining/dataset?authuser=0.

For the **Eedi dataset**, I will cite:
- **Eedi**: 
  > "Eedi: NeurIPS Education Challenge." Available at: https://eedi.com/projects/neurips-education-challenge.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly referenced. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.
