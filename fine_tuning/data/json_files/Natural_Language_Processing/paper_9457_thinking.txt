To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Large Deviations for Accelerating Neural Networks Training" by Sreelekha Guggilam et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and while it may not list datasets, it sets the context for what follows.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they provide a table (Table 1) that lists various benchmark datasets along with their characteristics, such as the number of instances (N), number of attributes (d), and number of classes (c). This table is crucial as it summarizes the datasets utilized in their study.

The datasets mentioned in the paper include:

1. **Ecoli**: N = 336, d = 7, c = 8
2. **Imgseg**: N = 2310, d = 18, c = 7
3. **Skin**: N = 245057, d = 4, c = 2
4. **Shuttle**: N = 58000, d = 10, c = 2
5. **Wisc**: N = 699, d = 9, c = 2
6. **Iono**: N = 351, d = 33, c = 2
7. **Zoo**: N = 101, d = 16, c = 7
8. **Letter**: N = 20000, d = 16, c = 26
9. **Comm And Crime**: N = 1994, d = 102, c = 2
10. **Vowel**: N = 990, d = 10, c = 11
11. **Fault**: N = 1941, d = 28, c = 2
12. **Sonar**: N = 208, d = 60, c = 2
13. **Balance-Scale**: N = 625, d = 4, c = 3
14. **Pageb**: N = 5473, d = 11, c = 2
15. **Spambase**: N = 4601, d = 58, c = 2
16. **Wave**: N = 5000, d = 22, c = 2
17. **Tae**: N = 151, d = 3, c = 3
18. **Thy**: N = 215, d = 5, c = 3
19. **Opt Digits**: N = 5620, d = 63, c = 10
20. **Concrete**: N = 1030, d = 9, c = 2

After identifying these datasets, I will then refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The paper cites the UCI Machine Learning Repository as the source for these datasets, which is a common repository for machine learning datasets.

The citation for the UCI Machine Learning Repository is:

Now, I will compile the dataset entries along with their respective citations into a structured format for clarity and future reference. This will ensure that I have a comprehensive list of datasets used in the research along with their authoritative sources.
