To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Hierarchical Prompting Taxonomy: A Universal Evaluation Framework for Large Language Models" by Devichand Budagam et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study and may mention specific datasets used for evaluation. In the introduction, the authors often discuss the context and significance of their work, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Methodology)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they list four datasets: 

1. **BoolQ**: This dataset consists of approximately 16,000 True/False questions with corresponding passages from Wikipedia, designed for binary classification in reading comprehension.

2. **CommonSenseQA (CSQA)**: This dataset contains around 12,000 multiple-choice questions sourced from ConceptNet, aimed at evaluating models' commonsense reasoning abilities.

3. **IWSLT-2017 en-fr (IWSLT)**: A parallel corpus with tens of thousands of English-French sentence pairs from TED Talks, used for machine translation tasks.

4. **SamSum**: This dataset features around 16,000 human-generated chat logs with summaries, facilitating dialogue summarization model development.

In the **results section**, the authors discuss the performance of various instruction-tuned LLMs on these datasets, confirming their use in the experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to guide readers to the original sources:

- For **BoolQ**, the citation is:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, facilitating further exploration and understanding of the work.
