To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Hand Gesture Classification on Praxis Dataset: Trading Accuracy for Expense" by Rahat Islam, Kenneth Lai, and Svetlana N. Yanushkevich, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract mentions the **PRAXIS dataset**, which is used for hand gesture classification based on skeletal data recorded from patients. This indicates that the dataset is central to the research.

Next, I will look into the **Dataset and Related Work** section, where the authors provide a detailed description of the PRAXIS dataset. They explain that the dataset consists of recordings of patients performing various hand gestures, including both healthy individuals and those with cortical pathologies like Alzheimer’s disease. The dataset captures RGB images, depth images, and skeletal data, which are crucial for their gesture classification models.

In this section, the authors also mention that the PRAXIS dataset was created by Negin et al. (2018), which is essential for citing the dataset correctly. The paper describes the dataset's purpose, the types of gestures included, and the methodology used for data collection.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citation for the PRAXIS dataset. The relevant citation is:

- For the **PRAXIS dataset**, the citation is:
  > F. Negin, P. Rodriguez, M. Koperski, A. Kerboua, J. Gonzalez, J. Bourgeois, E. Chapoulie, P. Robert, and B. Francois. "Praxis: Towards automatic cognitive assessment using gesture recognition." *Expert Systems with Applications*, vol. 106, pp. 21–35, 2018.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the dataset details and ensure that the citation is included. The PRAXIS dataset is the only dataset mentioned in this paper, and it is crucial to provide its full citation for proper acknowledgment in any further work or analysis.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format for clarity and future reference.
