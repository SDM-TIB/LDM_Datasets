To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Diff3DS: Generating View-Consistent 3D Sketch via Differentiable Curve Rendering" by Yibo Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the framework and its capabilities but does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will proceed to the introduction.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the context of 3D sketch generation and mention existing works but do not specify any datasets. I will then check the **experiments section** for any references to datasets used for evaluation.

In **section 6 (Experiments)**, the authors describe their implementation details and mention using a pre-trained model for their tasks. However, they do not explicitly list any datasets. I will look for any references to datasets in the **related works** section, as they often cite datasets used in previous studies.

Upon reviewing the **references section**, I will look for any papers that might have introduced datasets relevant to their work. The authors reference several works, but I need to ensure that they are indeed datasets and not just methodologies or frameworks.

After thoroughly checking the paper, I find that the authors do not explicitly mention any datasets used in their experiments. However, they reference several works that may have associated datasets. I will compile the relevant citations from the references section that could potentially lead to datasets.

For example, I will note the following references that might be associated with datasets:

1. **Stable Diffusion 2.1**:
   > Stability AI. *Stable diffusion 2.1*. Available at: https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-diffusion-2-1, 2023.

2. **Zero-1-to-3**:
   > Ruoshi Liu et al. *Zero-1-to-3: Zero-shot one image to 3D object*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision, pages 9298–9309, 2023.

3. **MVDream**:
   > Yichun Shi et al. *MVDream: Multi-view diffusion for 3D generation*. 2023.

4. **3Doodle**:
   > Changwoon Choi et al. *3Doodle: Compact abstraction of objects with 3D strokes*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2402.03690, 2024.

5. **CLIPasso**:
   > Yael Vinker et al. *Clipasso: Semantically-aware object sketching*. ACM Transactions on Graphics, 41(4):1–11, 2022.

Next, I will ensure to document the full citations for these references as they may lead to datasets or methodologies that utilize datasets.

Finally, I will summarize my findings and prepare to present the dataset information, ensuring that I have the full citations ready for each dataset or related work that may contain datasets.
