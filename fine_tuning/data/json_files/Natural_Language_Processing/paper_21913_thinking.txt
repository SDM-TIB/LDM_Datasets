To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Comparative Analysis of Adversarial Robustness for Quantum and Classical Machine Learning Models" by Maximilian Wendlinger et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract states that the authors created a "four-class image dataset for QML" which suggests that a dataset is indeed present.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experimental setup** section. In the **Experimental Setup and Results** section, the authors describe the dataset in detail, noting that it consists of four classes of grayscale images, with a total of 1000 training images and 200 test images. They also mention that the dataset is designed to allow semantic analysis while keeping input dimensions low.

The dataset is described as follows:
- **Four-Class Image Dataset**: This dataset contains images corresponding to four classes, specifically designed for evaluating adversarial attacks in quantum machine learning. Each image is a grayscale representation, and the dataset is balanced across the classes.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. However, since the dataset is specifically created for this study and does not appear to have an external citation, I will note that it is a proprietary dataset created by the authors.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring to include the dataset name and a brief description, along with the citation for the paper itself.

The citation for the paper is:
> Maximilian Wendlinger, Kilian Tscharke, Pascal Debus. *A Comparative Analysis of Adversarial Robustness for Quantum and Classical Machine Learning Models*. Fraunhofer Institute for Applied and Integrated Security, Garching near Munich, Germany.

Now, I will prepare the dataset entry based on the information gathered.
