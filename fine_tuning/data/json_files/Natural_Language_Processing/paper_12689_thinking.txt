To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Statistical Estimation Under Distribution Shift: Wasserstein Perturbations and Minimax Theory" by Patrick Chao and Edgar Dobriban, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

1. **Read the Abstract and Introduction**: I will start by examining the abstract and introduction sections to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract often provides a concise overview of the research and may highlight key datasets used in the study.

2. **Identify Sections on Datasets**: Next, I will look for sections that specifically discuss datasets, such as "Datasets," "Experiments," or "Methodology." These sections typically provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the research.

3. **Extract Dataset Information**: In the relevant sections, I will extract the names of the datasets, their descriptions, and any relevant details such as the number of samples, types of data, and any specific characteristics that are mentioned.

4. **Check for References**: After identifying the datasets, I will check the references section of the paper to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

5. **Document Each Dataset**: For each dataset identified, I will document the following information:
   - **Name of the Dataset**: The official name as mentioned in the paper.
   - **Description**: A brief description of the dataset, including its purpose and any relevant details.
   - **Full Citation**: The complete citation for the dataset as found in the references section.

6. **Compile the Information**: Finally, I will compile all the extracted information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly documented with its name, description, and citation.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets referenced in the research paper, providing a clear and comprehensive overview of the data used in the study.
