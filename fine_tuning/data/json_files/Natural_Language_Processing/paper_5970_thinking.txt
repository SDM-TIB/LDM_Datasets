To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Frequency Response from Aggregated V2G Chargers With Uncertain EV Connections" by Cormac Oâ€™Malley et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that field data from over **25,000 chargers** is analyzed, which suggests that this dataset is significant for the study.

Next, I will look for specific sections that might detail the datasets used, such as **section III (EV Connectivity Forecasting and Data Analysis)**. Here, the authors describe the use of real, open-source EV fleet charging data for 2017, which is crucial for understanding the context of their analysis. They mention two distinct fleets: the **domestic fleet** with **3.2 million charging events** across **25,000 10kW chargers**, and the **work fleet** with **103,000 charging events** across **540 20kW chargers**.

In this section, I will also note how the authors derived the continuous annual time-series of the number of connected EVs from the charging events, which is essential for their analysis.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper references the following:

1. **Electric Chargepoint Analysis 2017: Domestics**:
   > UK Department for Transport. *Electric Chargepoint Analysis 2017: Domestics*. Tech. Rep., Feb 2018. Available: https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/electric-chargepoint-analysis-2017-domestics.

2. **Field Data from V2G Chargers**:
   > The specific dataset from the V2G chargers is not cited in a formal reference but is derived from the analysis of the charging events mentioned in the paper.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research, ready for further processing or review.
