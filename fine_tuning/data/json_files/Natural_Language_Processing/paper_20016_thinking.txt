To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Artificial Intelligence Exploring the Patent Field" by Lekang Jiang and Stephan Goetz, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and data sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a high-level overview, while the introduction sets the context for the research and may mention specific datasets. The data sections are likely to contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the research.

In **section 4 (Data)**, the authors provide a comprehensive overview of various data sources and curated datasets. I will focus on the tables and descriptions provided in this section to identify the datasets mentioned.

The paper lists several datasets, including:

1. **USPTO-2M**: A dataset containing 2 million utility patents, which is used for classification tasks.
   - Citation: > Suzgun, M., Melas-Kyriazi, L., Sarkar, S. K., Kominers, S., & Shieber, S. (2023). The Harvard USPTO Patent Dataset: A large-scale, well-structured, and multi-purpose corpus of patent applications. In Thirty-seventh Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems Datasets and Benchmarks Track.

2. **USPTO-3M**: A dataset with 3 million classified documents, useful for classification tasks.
   - Citation: > Suzgun, M., Melas-Kyriazi, L., Sarkar, S. K., Kominers, S., & Shieber, S. (2023). The Harvard USPTO Patent Dataset: A large-scale, well-structured, and multi-purpose corpus of patent applications. In Thirty-seventh Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems Datasets and Benchmarks Track.

3. **WIPO-Alpha**: A dataset containing 75,000 documents classified into 114 classes.

4. **Crop Protection Industry Dataset**: A dataset focusing on the crop industry with 10,000 entries.
   - Citation: > GT4SD. (2023). Crop Protection Industry Dataset. Available at: https://github.com/GT4SD/domain-adaptive-patent-classifier

5. **DeepPatent**: An image-based patent retrieval benchmark with 45,000 images.
   - Citation: > Kucer, M., Oyen, D., Castorena, J., & Wu, J. (2022). Deeppatent: Large scale patent drawing recognition and retrieval. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision.

6. **PatentMatch**: A dataset for patent retrieval containing 6.3 million pairs of claims from cited patents.
   - Citation: > Risch, J., Alder, J., & Krestel, R. (2020). PatentMatch: A dataset for matching patent claims & prior art. arXiv preprint arXiv:2012.13919.

7. **TFH**: A dataset for information extraction with 40,000 labeled semantic relations.
   - Citation: > Jiang, S., Hu, J., & Luo, J. (2022). TFH: A dataset for extracting semantic relations in patents. Available at: https://github.com/awesome-patent-mining/TFH_Annotated_Dataset

8. **BigPatent**: A dataset containing 5.5 million granted and rejected patent applications.
   - Citation: > Sharma, E., Li, C., & Wang, L. (2019). BigPatent: A large-scale dataset for abstractive and coherent summarization. In Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics.

Next, I will ensure that I have the correct citations for each dataset, as this is crucial for proper referencing in any subsequent work.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for easy access and review. This will include the dataset name, source, task, size, and full citation for each dataset mentioned in the paper.
