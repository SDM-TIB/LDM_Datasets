To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Hire: Hybrid-modal Interaction with Multiple Relational Enhancements for Image-Text Matching" by Xuri Ge et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results on **MS-COCO and Flickr30K benchmarks**, indicating that these datasets are likely used in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they explicitly mention:

1. **MS-COCO**: The paper states that there are over 123,000 images in MS-COCO, with specific splits for training, validation, and testing. This dataset is widely recognized in the field of image-text matching.

2. **Flickr30K**: The authors mention that this dataset contains over 31,000 images, with a breakdown of training, validation, and testing images. This dataset is also commonly used for similar tasks.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **MS-COCO**, the citation is:
  > Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, Serge Belongie, James Hays, Pietro Perona, Deva Ramanan, Piotr DollÃ¡r, and C Lawrence Zitnick. *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. In European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), 2014.

- For **Flickr30K**, the citation is:
  > Peter Young, Alice Lai, Micah Hodosh, and Julia Hockenmaier. *From Image Descriptions to Visual Denotations: New Similarity Metrics for Semantic Inference over Event Descriptions*. Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics, 2014.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described accurately and includes the full citation as required. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details regarding the datasets used in the research.
