To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Unified Interactive Model Evaluation for Classification, Object Detection, and Instance Segmentation in Computer Vision" by Changjian Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions and may mention specific datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as this is where authors typically describe the datasets used in their studies. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

In this paper, the authors mention two datasets in the context of their case studies:

1. **COCO Dataset**: This dataset is widely known in the computer vision community and is used for object detection tasks. The authors state that it consists of 118,287 training samples and 5,000 test samples, with a total of 849,947 objects across 80 classes.

2. **iSAID Dataset**: This dataset is specifically designed for instance segmentation in aerial images. The authors mention that it contains 36,038 training samples and 11,752 test samples, with a total of 716,640 objects across 15 classes.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For the **COCO Dataset**, the citation is:
> T.-Y. Lin, M. Maire, S. Belongie, J. Hays, P. Perona, D. Ramanan, P. Dollár, and C. L. Zitnick. *Microsoft COCO: Common objects in context*. In Proceedings of the European Conference on Computer Vision, pp. 740–755, 2014. doi: 10.1007/978-3-319-10602-1_48.

For the **iSAID Dataset**, the citation is:
> S. Waqas Zamir, A. Arora, A. Gupta, S. Khan, G. Sun, F. Shahbaz Khan, F. Zhu, L. Shao, G.-S. Xia, and X. Bai. *iSAID: A large-scale dataset for instance segmentation in aerial images*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops, pp. 28–37, 2019.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or processing.
