To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Familiarity Facilitates Adoption: Evidence from Electric Vehicles" by Jonathan Libgober and Ruozi Song, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly referenced. The abstract mentions the **BlueLA program** and its impact on Electric Vehicle (EV) adoption, which suggests that there may be datasets related to this program.

Next, I will focus on the **data section** (Section 2) where the authors describe the datasets used for their analysis. They mention two primary sources of data:

1. **Clean Cars 4 All Program (CC4A)**: This dataset includes transaction-level data on subsidies for EV usage targeted at lower-income individuals. It contains information on the subsidy amount, the vehicle purchased, and the recipient's zipcode.

2. **LADOT Data**: This dataset provides the documented opening dates for each BlueLA charging station, which is crucial for understanding the timing of the program's rollout in different zip codes.

Additionally, the authors mention using data from the **Alternative Fuels Data Center** to supplement their analysis with information on the number of public chargers in each zipcode.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. However, since the datasets are derived from government programs and public data sources, they may not have formal citations like traditional datasets. Instead, I will summarize the sources as follows:

- For the **Clean Cars 4 All Program (CC4A)**, I will note that it is a publicly available dataset from the California government, specifically aimed at providing subsidies for EV purchases among low-income households.

- For the **LADOT Data**, I will mention that it is also publicly available data from the Los Angeles Department of Transportation, detailing the opening dates of BlueLA charging stations.

- For the **Alternative Fuels Data Center**, I will indicate that this is a resource provided by the U.S. Department of Energy, which tracks public charging stations across the country.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format, ensuring that I include the relevant details and citations for each dataset as described above. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
