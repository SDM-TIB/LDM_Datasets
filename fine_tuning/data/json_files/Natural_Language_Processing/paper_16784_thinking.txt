To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Teaching Specific Scientific Knowledge into Large Language Models through Additional Training" by Kan Hatakeyama-Sato et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions constructing a dataset of **65,000 scientific papers**, which indicates that a significant dataset is involved. I will note this as a primary dataset.

Next, I will look for specific sections that detail the datasets used. In the **Methods section**, particularly in **2.4 (Construction of scientific document datasets using open-access articles)**, the authors describe how they constructed a dataset from approximately **65,000 open-access papers** published by Springer Nature. This dataset is crucial for the study, and I will need to document it thoroughly.

The authors specify that they focused on several journals under the Creative Commons License, including **Nature Communications, npj Computational Materials, Nature Computational Science, Communications Chemistry, Communications Materials, and Scientific Reports**. This information is essential for the citation of the dataset.

In addition, I will check for any other datasets mentioned throughout the paper. In **section 2.2 (Preparation of a fictitious scientific document dataset)**, the authors describe creating a dataset of **fictitious scientific documents** for training purposes. This dataset is also relevant and should be included.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets. For the **65,000 scientific papers dataset**, the citation is:
> Springer Nature. *Open-access papers published under the Creative Commons Attribution (CC BY) license*. Available at: https://www.springernature.com/.

For the **fictitious scientific document dataset**, since it is created by the authors themselves, I will cite it as:
> Hatakeyama-Sato, K., Igarashi, Y., Katakami, S., Nabae, Y., Hayakawa, T. *Fictitious scientific document dataset for LLM training*. Unpublished dataset.

After compiling this information, I will ensure that each dataset is clearly described, including its purpose and the context in which it was used in the research. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the study, along with their proper citations.
