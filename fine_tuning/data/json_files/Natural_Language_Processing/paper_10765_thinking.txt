To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Consistent Optimal Transport with Empirical Conditional Measures" by Piyushi Manupriya et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for empirical validation.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 5), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments in detail. I will look for any specific dataset names, descriptions, and the context in which they were used.

In the experiments section, the authors mention the use of a dataset related to **cell population dynamics** involving the cancer drug Givinostat. They provide details about the number of samples for perturbed and unperturbed cells, which indicates that this dataset is crucial for their analysis.

I will also check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. The authors may refer to other works that describe the datasets they used, which is essential for proper citation.

From the paper, I identify the following datasets:

1. **Cell Population Dynamics Dataset**: This dataset includes samples of perturbed cells treated with Givinostat and unperturbed cells. The authors mention that there are 3541 perturbed cells and 17565 unperturbed cells, with gene expression levels described by 1000 highly variable genes.

   The citation for this dataset is:
   > Bunne, C., Stark, S. G., Gut, G., del Castillo, J. S., Levesque, M., Lehmann, K.-V., Pelkmans, L., Krause, A., and Ratsch, G. (2023). Learning single-cell perturbation responses using neural optimal transport. Nature Methods.

2. **EuroSAT Dataset**: This dataset is used for prompt learning in the context of vision-language models. The authors mention that they evaluate their performance on this dataset.

   The citation for this dataset is:
   > Helber, P., Bischke, B., Dengel, A., and Borth, D. (2019). Eurosat: A novel dataset and deep learning benchmark for land use and land cover classification. IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing, 12(7):2217â€“2226.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations to ensure proper documentation and facilitate further research or validation efforts.
