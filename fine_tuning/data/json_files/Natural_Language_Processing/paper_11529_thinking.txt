To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Neural Inventory Control in Networks via Hindsight Differentiable Policy Optimization" by Matias Alvo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the creation and sharing of new benchmark problems, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **introduction** and **experiments** sections. The introduction discusses the evaluation of techniques using real-time series data from a large retailer, which indicates that a dataset is being utilized.

In the **experiments section**, I will pay close attention to any subsections that describe the datasets used for training and testing. The authors mention using sales data from the Corporación Favorita Grocery Sales Forecasting competition, which is a clear indication of a dataset.

I will also check the **references section** for any citations related to the datasets. The paper mentions that the dataset encompasses around 200,000 daily sales time series for over 4,000 products across 54 stores, spanning the years 2013 to 2018. This information is crucial for documenting the dataset.

Now, I will compile the information about the datasets:

1. **Corporación Favorita Grocery Sales Dataset**: This dataset includes approximately 200,000 daily sales time series for over 4,000 products across 54 stores from 2013 to 2018. It is used to evaluate the performance of the proposed methods in real-world scenarios.

The full citation for this dataset is:
> Corporación Favorita. *Favorita Grocery Sales Forecasting*. Kaggle. URL: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/favorita-grocery-sales-forecasting/overview.

After gathering this information, I will ensure that I have accurately documented the dataset's details and citation for future reference or processing.
