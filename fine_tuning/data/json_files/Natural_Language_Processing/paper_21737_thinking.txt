To extract datasets from the research paper titled "FedMeS: Personalized Federated Continual Learning Leveraging Local Memory" by Jin Xie, Chenqing Zhu, and Songze Li, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of the proposed method on various datasets, which indicates that datasets are likely included in the paper.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section, where the authors may provide context about the datasets used in their experiments. This section often contains references to specific datasets or benchmarks that are crucial for understanding the research.

I will then look at the **experiments** section, which typically details the datasets used for evaluation. In this paper, the authors mention using five commonly used public datasets: **CIFAR-100**, **EMNIST**, **CORe50**, **MiniImageNet-100**, and **TinyImageNet-200**. I will note down these datasets and any relevant details provided about them, such as their characteristics or how they were split for the experiments.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **results** section to confirm that these datasets were indeed used in the experiments and to gather any performance metrics that may be relevant.

Finally, I will consult the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. The citations for the datasets mentioned in the paper are as follows:

1. **CIFAR-100**:

2. **EMNIST**:

3. **CORe50**:
   > Lomonaco, V., & Maltoni, D. (2017). CORe50: A new dataset and benchmark for continuous object recognition. In Conference on Robot Learning, pp. 17–26. DOI: 10.48550/arXiv.1705.03550.

4. **MiniImageNet**:
   > Vinyals, O., Blundell, C., Lillicrap, T., & Wierstra, D. (2016). Matching networks for one shot learning. Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 29. DOI: 10.48550/arXiv.1606.04080.

5. **TinyImageNet**:
   > Not explicitly cited in the paper, but it is commonly referenced in the literature. A typical citation is:
   > Deng, J., Dong, W., Socher, R., Li, L. J., Li, K., & Fei-Fei, L. (2009). ImageNet: A large-scale hierarchical image database. In 2009 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 248–255. DOI: 10.1109/CVPR.2009.5206848.

Now that I have gathered the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
