To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Wine is Not v i n. On the Compatibility of Tokenizations Across Languages" by Antonis Maronikolakis, Philipp Dufter, and Hinrich Schütze, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, which may hint at the datasets used.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors describe their experimental setup and the data they used. I will pay close attention to any sections that discuss the data used for training and evaluation, as these are likely to contain the dataset names.

In **section 4.1 (Data)**, the authors mention the **Parallel Bible Corpus (PBC)** as the primary dataset used for their experiments. They describe it as a multi-parallel corpus spanning 1259 languages and up to 30,000 verses per translation. This is a significant dataset for their research.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Parallel Bible Corpus. The citation provided in the paper is:
> Thomas Mayer and Michael Cysouw. *Creating a massively parallel Bible corpus*. In Proceedings of the Ninth International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC’14), pages 3158–3163, Reykjavik, Iceland, 2014.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will ensure that I have all necessary details to describe the dataset accurately.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format, ensuring that the full citation is included, as this is crucial for proper attribution and reference.

By following these steps, I will have successfully extracted the relevant dataset from the paper along with its full citation.
