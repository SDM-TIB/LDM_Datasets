To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Utility Pole Fire Risk Inspection from 2D Street-Side Images" by Rajanie Prabha and Kopal Nihar, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their full citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses using Google Street View imagery, which suggests that this imagery is a key dataset for the research.

Next, I will focus on the **data section** (section 3), where the authors describe their data collection methodology. They mention using **PG&E Electric Distribution GIS Application data**, which provides information on utility poles, and they also discuss collecting **2D street-side images from Google Street View**. This indicates that both datasets are crucial for their analysis.

In the **methodology section**, the authors detail their approaches, but they do not introduce new datasets. Instead, they elaborate on how they utilize the previously mentioned datasets (Google Street View imagery and PG&E data) for their experiments.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper does not provide specific citations for the datasets themselves, but I can infer the following based on the context:

1. **Google Street View Imagery**: While the paper does not provide a formal citation, I can reference Googleâ€™s documentation or the general availability of Google Street View data. A suitable citation might be:
   > Google. *Google Street View*. Available at: https://www.google.com/streetview/

2. **PG&E Electric Distribution GIS Application Data**: This dataset is specific to PG&E and may not have a formal citation in the same way academic datasets do. However, I can reference PG&E as follows:
   > Pacific Gas and Electric Company. *PG&E Electric Distribution GIS Application Data*. Available at: [PG&E website link if available].

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research.
