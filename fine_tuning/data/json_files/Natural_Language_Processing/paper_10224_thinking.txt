To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Seeing Electric Network Frequency from Events" by Lexuan Xu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors constructed an **Event-Video ENF Dataset (EV-ENFD)**, which is a strong indication that this dataset is central to their research.

Next, I will look for specific details about the dataset in the **experiments section**. In this section, the authors describe the EV-ENFD, noting that it contains both events and videos recorded in various scenes, categorized into static, dynamic, and extreme lighting conditions. They mention that the dataset consists of 51 sets of data, which is crucial information for understanding its scope.

I will also check the **dataset description** to gather more details. The authors explain that the dataset includes:
- 16 sets of static scene data
- 25 sets of dynamic scene data
- 10 sets of extreme lighting scene data
Each set comprises a stream of events, a low-resolution video, and a high-resolution video.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. However, since the dataset is newly constructed and not previously published, it may not have a formal citation in the references. Instead, I will note the authors' statement that the dataset is available at a specific URL: https://xlx-creater.github.io/E-ENF/.

Thus, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring to include the dataset name, description, and the URL for access. The citation for the dataset will be noted as follows:

- **Event-Video ENF Dataset (EV-ENFD)**: A dataset containing both events and videos recorded in diverse scenes, categorized into static, dynamic, and extreme lighting conditions. The dataset includes a total of 51 sets of data, with various resolutions and conditions. The dataset is available at:
  > Lexuan Xu, Guang Hua, Haijian Zhang, Lei Yu, Ning Qiao. *Event-Video ENF Dataset (EV-ENFD)*. Available at: https://xlx-creater.github.io/E-ENF/.

After gathering all this information, I will ensure that it is clearly organized and ready for any further processing or review.
