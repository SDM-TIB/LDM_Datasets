To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Enhancing Robustness to Noise Corruption for Point Cloud Model via Spatial Sorting and Set-Mixing Aggregation Module" by Dingxin Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that experiments were conducted on **ModelNet40-C**, which suggests that this is a dataset of interest.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors discuss their methodology and the datasets used. In **section 4.2**, the authors explicitly mention two datasets:

1. **ModelNet40**: This is described as a synthetic dataset widely used in point cloud analysis, consisting of 9,843 samples for training and 2,468 samples for testing, categorized into 40 distinct categories of CAD models.

2. **ModelNet40-C**: This dataset is derived from ModelNet40 by introducing various types of corruption to evaluate robustness against noise. It includes 15 distinct corruption types with five variations for each category.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **ModelNet40**, the citation is:
  > Wu, Z., Song, S., Khosla, A., Yu, F., Zhang, L., Tang, X., Xiao, J. *3D ShapeNets: A Deep Representation for Volumetric Shapes*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 1912â€“1920, 2015. https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2015.7298801

- For **ModelNet40-C**, the citation is:
  > Sun, J., Zhang, Q., Kailkhura, B., Yu, Z., Xiao, C., Mao, Z.M. *Benchmarking Robustness of 3D Point Cloud Recognition Against Common Corruptions*. CoRR abs/2201.12296, 2022. https://doi.org/10.48550/ARXIV.2201.12296

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **ModelNet40**: A synthetic dataset for point cloud analysis, consisting of 9,843 training samples and 2,468 testing samples across 40 categories.
2. **ModelNet40-C**: A corrupted version of ModelNet40 designed to evaluate robustness against noise, featuring 15 corruption types with five variations each.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
