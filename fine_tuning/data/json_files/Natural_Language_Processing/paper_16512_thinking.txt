To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Mergen: The First Manchu-Korean Machine Translation Model" by Jean Seo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and data sections** to locate any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors developed a Manchu-Korean machine translation model and utilized various resources, which suggests that datasets are involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention the challenges of low-resource machine translation and refer to the use of parallel corpora for training their model. This hints at the presence of specific datasets, but I need to find their exact names and details.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Data)**, where the authors describe the materials used for their study. They mention two sets of parallel corpora:

1. **Mˇanwén Lˇaodàng (1774-1778)**: This is a historical text that contains Manchu texts and their corresponding translations in Korean. The authors specify that they only utilize a section of this corpus for their experiments.

2. **Manchu-Korean Dictionary**: This dictionary serves as another parallel corpus, providing translations between Manchu and Korean.

The authors also provide details about the size of these datasets, which is crucial for understanding their scope and application.

In the **experiments section**, the authors confirm that they merged the Mˇanwén Lˇaodàng with the Manchu-Korean dictionary for training their model, further validating that these are the datasets used in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Mˇanwén Lˇaodàng**, the citation is:
  > Kim, J., Ko, D., Choe, G., Park, S., Do, J., Lee, H., Jin, H., & Shim, J. (2019). *Tongki Fuka Sindaha Hergen i Dangse - The Chronicles of Early Qing Dynasty: Taizu Vol. 1*. Seoul National University Press, Seoul.

- For the **Manchu-Korean Dictionary**, the citation is:
  > Lee, H. (2017). *Manju Solho Gisun Kamcibuha Buleku Bithe - Manhan-sacen*. Korea University Press, Seoul.

Having gathered this information, I will now compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research.
