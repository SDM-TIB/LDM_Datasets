To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Automatic Evaluation of Turn-taking Cues in Conversational Speech Synthesis" by Erik Ekstedt et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of TTS systems, which suggests that there may be datasets involved in the experiments.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention the need for evaluating conversational TTS systems, but I need to look for specific datasets used in their experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors describe their methodology. Here, they mention extracting text data from the **MultiWOZ corpus**. This corpus is explicitly stated to contain over 10,000 annotated written dialogs across various domains, which is a clear indication of a dataset being utilized.

Additionally, in the **automatic evaluation method section**, the authors refer to the **Fisher corpus** and the **Switchboard corpus** as part of the training data for their Voice Activity Projection model. This indicates that these datasets are also relevant to their research.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

1. **MultiWOZ corpus**:

2. **Fisher corpus**:

3. **Switchboard corpus**:
   > Godfrey, J. J., Holliman, E. C., & McDaniel, J. (1992). Switchboard: Telephone speech corpus for research and development. In Proceedings of the 1992 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing. USA: IEEE Computer Society, pp. 517–520.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets:

- **MultiWOZ corpus**: A dataset containing over 10,000 annotated written dialogs across 8 different domains, used for simulating interactions in a spoken dialog system.
- **Fisher corpus**: A resource for speech-to-text research, used in training the VAP model.
- **Switchboard corpus**: A telephone speech corpus that serves as another training resource for the VAP model.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
