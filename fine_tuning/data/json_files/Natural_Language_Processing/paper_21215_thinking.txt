To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Comparative Analysis of Word-Level Metric Differential Privacy: Benchmarking The Privacy-Utility Trade-off" by Stephen Meisenbacher et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Experimental Design)**, where the authors describe the tasks and datasets used in their comparative analysis. Here, they mention two specific datasets:

1. **IMDb Movie Review Dataset**: This dataset is used for the sentiment analysis task and consists of 50,000 movie reviews classified as either negative or positive. The authors specify that they used a random sample of 12,000 reviews for their experiments.

2. **AG News Dataset**: This dataset is used for the topic classification task and contains nearly 130,000 text excerpts from news articles across four categories: world, sports, business, and science. The authors indicate that they took a random sample of 6,000 articles from each topic for their analysis.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **IMDb Movie Review Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Andrew L. Maas, Raymond E. Daly, Peter T. Pham, Dan Huang, Andrew Y. Ng, and Christopher Potts. *Learning word vectors for sentiment analysis*. In Proceedings of the 49th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, pages 142â€“150, 2011.

- For the **AG News Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Xiang Zhang, Junbo Jake Zhao, and Yann LeCun. *Character-level convolutional networks for text classification*. In NIPS, 2015.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations as required. This structured approach will help me accurately extract and present the datasets used in the research paper.
