To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Optimizing IaC Configurations: a Case Study Using Nature-inspired Computing" by Eneko Osaba et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's objectives and may hint at the use of datasets, particularly in the context of the IaC Optimizer Platform (IOP).

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any mentions of datasets or data sources used in the research. The introduction discusses the IOP and its context within the PIACERE project, which may involve specific datasets related to Infrastructure as Code (IaC) configurations.

I will then look into the **related work section** to identify if any datasets are referenced in the context of previous studies or frameworks that the authors have built upon. This section may provide insights into datasets that are commonly used in similar research.

In the **practical use case section**, the authors describe a real-world application of the IOP. I will pay close attention to any datasets or input data formats mentioned, particularly the DOML (Deployment Optimization Modeling Language) file, which may contain specific data structures or examples that could be considered datasets.

After identifying any datasets mentioned in the paper, I will consult the **references section** to find full citations for these datasets. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access the datasets.

If the paper references specific datasets or data sources, I will ensure to document them accurately, including the title, description, and full citation for each dataset. If no explicit datasets are mentioned, I will note that as well.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format that clearly presents each dataset, its description, and the corresponding citation, ensuring that all details are accurate and complete for future reference.
