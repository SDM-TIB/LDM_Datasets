To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Capacity Analysis of Vector Symbolic Architectures" by Kenneth L. Clarkson, Shashanka Ubaru, and Elizabeth Yang, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections that discuss experiments or methodologies** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's focus, but I need to look for specific mentions of datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to see if the authors reference any datasets used in their analyses or experiments. If they mention any specific datasets or benchmarks, I will take note of their names and any relevant details.

I will then examine the **methodology and results sections** for any explicit mentions of datasets. These sections often contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used for experiments, including their characteristics, sizes, and how they were utilized in the study.

In this paper, I will specifically look for mentions of datasets related to Vector Symbolic Architectures (VSAs) and any empirical evaluations that might involve datasets. If the authors refer to well-known datasets, I will ensure to capture their full names and any relevant context.

Once I identify the datasets, I will check the **references section** for full citations. This is crucial as I need to provide complete citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. I will look for the original papers or sources that describe these datasets in detail.

For example, if the authors mention a dataset like the "Penn Action Dataset," I will find its full citation, which might look something like this:
> Wenzheng Zhang, Menglong Zhu, and Konstantinos G. Derpanis. *From Actemes to Action: A Strongly-Supervised Representation for Detailed Action Understanding*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 2248â€“2255, 2013.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that I maintain clarity and accuracy in the representation of each dataset.

Finally, I will prepare the extracted information in a structured format that can be easily reviewed or processed further, ensuring that all datasets are clearly identified and cited appropriately.
