To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Rate-Quality or Energy-Quality Pareto Fronts for Adaptive Video Streaming?" by Angeliki Katsenou et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their methods on a subset of YouTube-UGC videos, which suggests that this dataset is significant for their research.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Test Sequences, Video Codec, and Energy Measurements)**, where the authors describe the dataset used for their experiments. They mention that they selected sequences from the **YouTube-UGC dataset**, which comprises various genres of user-generated content. This section provides details about the specific videos used, including their resolution and characteristics.

The authors specify that they used **2160p native sequences from the Animation, Gaming, Sports, HDR, and Vlogs genres**, totaling 82 videos. This information is crucial for understanding the dataset's scope and application.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the YouTube-UGC dataset. The relevant citation is:

- **YouTube-UGC Dataset**: 
  > Y. Wang, S. Inguva, and B. Adsumilli. *YouTube UGC Dataset for Video Compression Research*. In IEEE 21st International Workshop on Multimedia Signal Processing (MMSP), 2019.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the YouTube-UGC dataset.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for the YouTube-UGC dataset, ensuring that it is clear and complete for any future reference or processing.
