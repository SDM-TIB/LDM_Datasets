To extract datasets from the research paper titled "VQA-GEN: A Visual Question Answering Benchmark for Domain Generalization" by Suraj Jyothi Unni et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are mentioned. The abstract introduces VQA-GEN as a novel dataset for visual question answering (VQA) that addresses distribution shifts, which indicates that this is a primary dataset of interest.

Next, I will examine the **main body of the paper**, particularly the sections that discuss the dataset in detail. I will focus on sections that explicitly mention datasets, such as the **Datasets** section or any experimental sections where datasets are utilized.

In the paper, the authors mention three datasets in Table 1: **VQA-GEN**, **VQA-Compose**, and **VQA-CP**. I will extract details about each of these datasets:

1. **VQA-GEN**: This is the primary dataset introduced in the paper, designed for evaluating VQA models under multi-modal distribution shifts. The paper describes its generation process and significance in improving model robustness.

2. **VQA-Compose**: This dataset is referenced as a benchmark for VQA that focuses on logically composed binary questions. It is important to note its role in the context of the paper.

3. **VQA-CP**: This dataset is mentioned as a counterfactual dataset for VQA, which tests generalization capabilities. It is crucial to include this dataset as it is compared against VQA-GEN in the experiments.

Next, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations will provide the necessary details for each dataset, including authors, title, publication venue, and year.

For **VQA-GEN**, since it is a new dataset introduced in this paper, I will cite it as follows:
> Suraj Jyothi Unni, Raha Moraffah, Huan Liu. *VQA-GEN: A Visual Question Answering Benchmark for Domain Generalization*. In Proceedings of the SIAM International Conference on Data Mining, 2023.

For **VQA-Compose**, the citation is:
> T. Gokhale, P. Banerjee, C. Baral, Y. Yang. *VQA-LOL: Visual Question Answering Under the Lens of Logic*. CoRR, vol. abs/2002.08325, 2020.

For **VQA-CP**, the citation is:
> A. Agrawal, D. Batra, D. Parikh, A. Kembhavi. *Don't Just Assume; Look and Answer: Overcoming Question Answering*. CoRR, vol. abs/1712.00377, 2017.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their relevant details from the research paper.
