To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Leveraging the Context through Multi-Round Interactions for Jailbreaking Attacks" by Yixin Cheng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract mentions conducting experiments on four different LLMs and highlights the use of datasets for evaluating the effectiveness of the proposed attack. This indicates that datasets are likely discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically **section 4 (Experiment)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they explicitly list three datasets:

1. **OpenAI and Anthropic Red Teaming Dataset**: This dataset consists of 32 harmful prompts, combining 16 prompts from the GPT-4 Technical Report and 16 from the Anthropic Red Teaming Dataset.

2. **MasterKey Dataset**: This dataset includes 10 distinct restrictive scenarios, with five-question prompts crafted for each scenario, totaling 50 instances.

3. **AdvBench Subset Dataset**: This dataset is a curated subset of 50 harmful prompts selected from the AdvBench benchmark.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for future researchers.

- For the **OpenAI and Anthropic Red Teaming Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Achiam, J., Adler, S., Agarwal, S., Ahmad, L., Akkaya, I., Aleman, F. L., Almeida, D., Altenschmidt, J., Altman, S., Anadkat, S., et al. *GPT-4 Technical Report*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2303.08774, 2023.

- For the **MasterKey Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Deng, G., Liu, Y., Li, Y., Wang, K., Zhang, Y., Li, Z., Wang, H., Zhang, T., and Liu, Y. *Jailbreaker: Automated jailbreak across multiple large language model chatbots*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2307.08715, 2023.

- For the **AdvBench Subset Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Zou, A., Wang, Z., Kolter, J. Z., and Fredrikson, M. *Universal and transferable adversarial attacks on aligned language models*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2307.15043, 2023.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference and further analysis. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations for future use.
