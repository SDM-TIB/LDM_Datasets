To extract datasets from the research paper titled "VISOGENDER: A dataset for benchmarking gender bias in image-text pronoun resolution" by Siobhan Mackenzie Hall et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are mentioned. The abstract introduces the VISOGENDER dataset, which is the primary focus of the paper. It describes the dataset's purpose and its structure, indicating that it is designed for benchmarking gender bias in vision-language models.

Next, I will examine **section 3 (The VISOGENDER Benchmark)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset. This section outlines the dataset's composition, including the number of images, the types of images (single-person and two-person), and the occupations represented. It states that the VISOGENDER dataset contains **690 images** of people in various occupational settings, annotated for perceived gender presentation.

I will also look for any references to other datasets that may have been used for comparison or as part of the methodology. In the **related works** section, the authors mention prior datasets like FairFace and COCO, but these are not the primary focus of the paper.

In the **results** and **discussion** sections, the authors analyze the performance of various vision-language models on the VISOGENDER dataset, but they do not introduce any new datasets in these sections.

Now, I will compile the information I have gathered about the VISOGENDER dataset and ensure I have the full citation for it. The citation for the VISOGENDER dataset is as follows:

- For the VISOGENDER dataset, the citation is:

In Proceedings of the 37th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2023), Track on Datasets and Benchmarks.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the dataset details and the citation in a structured format for clarity and future reference. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the necessary information regarding the dataset from the research paper.
