To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Modelling the Human Intuition to Complete the Missing Information in Images for Convolutional Neural Networks" by Robin Koc and Fatos T. Yarman Vural, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors use the **MNIST dataset** to test their intuition model for completing missing information. This is a clear indication that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will look for more details in the **experiments section**. In section 5, the authors describe their experimental setup and mention that they generate multiple test datasets with incomplete images derived from the **MNIST dataset**. They explain how they manipulate the dataset by segmenting images and removing segments to create deficient test datasets.

Since the MNIST dataset is the primary dataset used in their experiments, I will ensure to find the full citation for it in the **References section**. The MNIST dataset is a well-known dataset in the machine learning community, and its citation is:

- For the **MNIST dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Chris Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998. Available: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity.

In summary, the key dataset extracted from the paper is the **MNIST dataset**, and I have noted its full citation for reference. This will allow for proper attribution and further exploration of the dataset in future work.
