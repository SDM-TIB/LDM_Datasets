To extract datasets from the research paper titled "TIFG: Text-Informed Feature Generation with Large Language Models" by Xinhao Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions but may not detail specific datasets. The introduction often discusses the context and relevance of the research, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically **section 5**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention four datasets: 

1. **Insurance Claim Prediction (ICP)**: This dataset is used for predicting health insurance claims and contains 15,000 samples with 12 features and a target class of "Claim".

2. **Animal Information Dataset (AID)**: This dataset includes information about various animals, comprising 205 samples with 15 features and a target class of "Social Structure".

3. **Global Country Information Dataset (GCI)**: This dataset provides information about countries worldwide, containing 195 samples with 34 features and a target class of "Life Expectancy".

4. **Diabetes Health Indicators Dataset (DIA)**: This dataset focuses on diabetes-related health indicators, consisting of 253,680 samples with 21 features and a target class of "Diabetes Binary".

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **Insurance Claim Prediction (ICP)**, the citation is:
  > Suresh Gupta. 2023. *Health insurance data set*. Kaggle. Accessed: date-of-access.

- For **Animal Information Dataset (AID)**, the citation is:
  > Sourav Banerjee. 2023. *Animal information dataset*. Kaggle.

- For **Global Country Information Dataset (GCI)**, the citation is:
  > Countries of the world 2023. *Available online: Kaggle*. Accessed: date-of-access.

- For **Diabetes Health Indicators Dataset (DIA)**, the citation is:
  > Alex Teboul. 2023. *Diabetes health indicators dataset*. Kaggle. Accessed: date-of-access.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its citation. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant information regarding the datasets used in the research paper.
