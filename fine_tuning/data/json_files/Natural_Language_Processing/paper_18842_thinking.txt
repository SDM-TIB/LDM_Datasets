To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fixed width treelike neural networks capacity analysis â€“ generic activations" by Mihailo Stojnic, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, but it may not contain detailed information about datasets. Therefore, I will focus on the introduction and methodology sections, where the authors typically describe their experimental setup and the data used.

Next, I will look for any references to datasets in the **experiments or results sections**. These sections often contain specific mentions of datasets used for training or testing the models. If the paper includes tables or figures, I will examine them closely, as they may summarize dataset characteristics or results derived from specific datasets.

If the paper discusses any datasets, I will note their names, descriptions, and any relevant details such as the number of samples, types of data, and the context in which they were used. I will also check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like "MNIST," I would look for the full citation, which might be something like:
> Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their full citations, into a structured format for clarity and ease of use.

Finally, I will ensure that all extracted datasets are accurately represented and that their citations are complete, as this is essential for academic integrity and for readers who may wish to explore the datasets further.
