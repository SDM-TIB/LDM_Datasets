To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ComPtr: Towards Diverse Bi-source Dense Prediction Tasks via A Simple yet General Complementary Transformer" by Youwei Pang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that the proposed method is evaluated on several representative vision tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this paper, the authors specifically mention four types of tasks with associated datasets:

1. **LEVIR-CD Dataset**: This dataset is used for remote sensing change detection. It contains 637 pairs of real bi-temporal RGB image patches with a time span of 5-14 years, with a spatial resolution of 0.5 m/pixel.

2. **SYSU-CD Dataset**: Another dataset for remote sensing change detection, containing 20,000 pairs of aerial images taken between 2007 and 2014 in Hong Kong.

3. **RGBT-CC Dataset**: This dataset is used for RGB-T crowd counting and contains 2030 RGB-T pairs with 138,389 point-annotated people.

4. **RGB-D SOD Datasets**: The authors mention five datasets for RGB-D salient object detection, including NJUD, NLPR, STEREO1000, SIP, and DUTLF-Depth.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **LEVIR-CD**, the citation is:

- For **SYSU-CD**, the citation is:

- For the **RGB-D SOD datasets**, I will compile the citations for each:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
