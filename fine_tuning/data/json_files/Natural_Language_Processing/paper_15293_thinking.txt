To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Irreducible Curriculum for Language Model Pretraining" by Simin Fan and Martin Jaggi, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract indicates that experiments were conducted on the **RedPajama-1B dataset**, which is a strong indication that this dataset is central to the research.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section 4) to gather more details about the datasets used. In Section 4, the authors mention that they split the **RedPajama-1B dataset** into two subsets: **Dproxy** and **Dtrain**. This confirms that the RedPajama-1B dataset is indeed the primary dataset utilized in their experiments.

I will also look for any references to other datasets in the paper. In the **experiments section**, the authors refer to various domains such as Arxiv, Wikipedia, Book, Common-Crawl, C4, Stackexchange, and Github, but they do not specify separate datasets for these domains. Instead, they indicate that these domains are part of the **RedPajama-1B dataset**.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the **RedPajama-1B dataset**. The paper provides a URL for the dataset, which is crucial for proper citation. The citation for the dataset is as follows:

- **RedPajama-1B Dataset**:
  > Together Computer. *RedPajama-Data-1T-Sample*. Available at: https://huggingface.co/datasets/togethercomputer/RedPajama-Data-1T-Sample.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets explicitly, I will conclude that the **RedPajama-1B dataset** is the only dataset extracted from this research paper.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry with the full citation into a structured format for clarity and future reference.
