To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Survey of Resilient Coordination for Cyber-Physical Systems Against Malicious Attacks" by Zirui Liao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections. These sections often provide a summary of the key contributions and may mention specific datasets used in the research. In this case, the abstract discusses the focus on resilient coordination in cyber-physical systems (CPSs) but does not explicitly mention any datasets.

Next, I will examine the **methodology and experiments sections** of the paper. These sections typically detail the datasets used for experiments or analyses. I will look for any references to datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics. If the paper discusses specific experiments or case studies, I will note any datasets mentioned in those contexts.

After that, I will check the **results and discussion sections**. Authors often refer to datasets when discussing their findings or comparing their results with previous work. If any datasets are mentioned, I will take note of their descriptions and any relevant details provided.

I will also look for a **dedicated section on datasets** if it exists, as some papers include a specific section that outlines the datasets used in their research. This section may provide comprehensive details about each dataset, including its purpose, size, and any preprocessing steps taken.

Once I have identified the datasets, I will refer to the **references section** of the paper to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research. I will ensure that I capture the authors, title, publication venue, and any other relevant details for each dataset.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited. This will include the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets referenced in the paper, providing a clear and comprehensive overview for future reference.
