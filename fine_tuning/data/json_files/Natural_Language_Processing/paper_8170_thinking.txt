To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MASS: Multi-Attribute Selective Suppression" by Chun-Fu (Richard) Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted an extensive evaluation using multiple datasets from different domains, which indicates that there are datasets to be identified. The introduction further emphasizes the importance of large-scale datasets in machine learning, hinting at specific datasets that may be referenced later.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments** section. In this paper, the authors explicitly describe the datasets used in their experiments in **section 4.1 (Experimental Setup)**. Here, they mention three datasets:

1. **Adience Dataset**: This dataset is used for facial images and is associated with attributes such as age and gender. The authors specify that it contains 1,089 different DataIDs, 8 age groups, and 2 gender classes.

2. **AudioMNIST Dataset**: This dataset consists of audio recordings of spoken digits from 60 speakers and includes attributes like speakerID, spoken digits, accent, and gender. The total number of audio clips is 30,000.

3. **PA-HMDB Dataset**: This is a subset of the HMDB51 dataset, containing 6 attributes related to action recognition and other non-action attributes. The authors note that it contains about 500 videos.

After identifying these datasets, I will proceed to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow readers to access the datasets.

The citations I will extract are:

- For the **Adience Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Eran Eidinger, Roee Enbar, and Tal Hassner. *Age and gender estimation of unfiltered faces*. IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security, 9(12):2170–2179, 2014.

- For the **AudioMNIST Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Sören Becker, Marcel Ackermann, Sebastian Lapuschkin, Klaus-Robert Müller, and Wojciech Samek. *Interpreting and explaining deep neural networks for classification of audio signals*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1807.03418, 2018.

- For the **PA-HMDB Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Hildegard Kuehne, Hueihan Jhuang, Estíbaliz Garrote, Tomaso Poggio, and Thomas Serre. *HMDB: A large video database for human motion recognition*. In 2011 International Conference on Computer Vision, pp. 2556–2563. IEEE, 2011.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This will ensure that all relevant details are captured accurately and can be referenced appropriately in future work.
