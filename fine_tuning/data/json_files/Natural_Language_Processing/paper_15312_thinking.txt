To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MuLMS: A Multi-Layer Annotated Text Corpus for Information Extraction in the Materials Science Domain" by Timo Pierre Schrader et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the paper presents a new dataset called **MuLMS**, which is a good starting point.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (MuLMS Corpus)**, where the authors describe the dataset in detail. Here, they mention that MuLMS consists of **50 open-access articles** spanning seven sub-domains of materials science. This section will provide insights into the dataset's structure, annotations, and purpose.

In addition to MuLMS, I will look for references to other datasets in the **related work section** (section 2). The authors mention two other datasets: 

1. **SOFC-Exp Corpus**: This dataset is referenced in the context of experiments related to solid oxide fuel cells. The authors indicate that some papers in MuLMS were selected from this corpus.

2. **Materials Science Procedural Text (MSPT) Corpus**: This dataset is also mentioned as a related resource for multi-task learning experiments.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **MuLMS**, the citation is:
  > Timo Pierre Schrader, Matteo Finco, Stefan Grünewald, Felix Hildebrand, Annemarie Friedrich. *MuLMS: A Multi-Layer Annotated Text Corpus for Information Extraction in the Materials Science Domain*. In Proceedings of the [Conference Name], [pages], [year].

- For **SOFC-Exp Corpus**, the citation is:
  > Annemarie Friedrich, Heike Adel, Federico Tomazic, Johannes Hingerl, Renou Benteau, Anika Marusczyk, and Lukas Lange. *The SOFC-exp corpus and neural approaches to information extraction in the materials science domain*. In Proceedings of the 58th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, pages 1255–1268, 2020.

- For **MSPT Corpus**, the citation is:
  > Sheshera Mysore, Zachary Jensen, Edward Kim, Kevin Huang, Haw-Shiuan Chang, Emma Strubell, Jeffrey Flanigan, Andrew McCallum, and Elsa Olivetti. *The materials science procedural text corpus: Annotating materials synthesis procedures with shallow semantic structures*. In Proceedings of the 13th Linguistic Annotation Workshop, pages 56–64, 2019.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This includes ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation.
