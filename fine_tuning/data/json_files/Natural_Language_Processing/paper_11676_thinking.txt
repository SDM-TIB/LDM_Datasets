To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Utilizing deep learning for automated tuning of database management systems" by Karthick Gunasekaran et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract mentions the evaluation of a tool called **OtterTune** on three different database management systems (DBMSs), which suggests that there may be datasets related to these systems.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. The authors discuss experiments conducted on two OLTP DBMSs (MySQL and Postgres) and one OLAP DBMS (Vector). I will need to determine if the paper provides any specific dataset names or references for the workloads used in these experiments.

In the **experiments section**, the authors describe the data preprocessing steps and mention that they had to preprocess data from offline workloads and online workloads B and C. However, they do not provide specific names for these datasets. I will need to check the **References section** to see if any external datasets are cited that may have been used in their experiments.

Upon reviewing the references, I find that the paper cites the original OtterTune paper, which is crucial for understanding the datasets used. The citation for the OtterTune paper is:

- **OtterTune**: Dana Van Aken, Andrew Pavlo, Geoffrey J. Gordon, and Bohan Zhang. *Automatic database management system tuning through large-scale machine learning*. In Proceedings of the 2017 ACM International Conference on Management of Data, SIGMOD ’17, pages 1009–1024, New York, NY, USA. Association for Computing Machinery.

Since the paper does not provide specific datasets but refers to workloads used in the context of the OtterTune tool, I will document the relevant information regarding the workloads and their context.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, including the relevant citations, into a structured format that captures the necessary details for each dataset mentioned or implied in the paper. This will ensure that I have a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.
