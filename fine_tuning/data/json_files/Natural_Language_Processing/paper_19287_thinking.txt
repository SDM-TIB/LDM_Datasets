To extract datasets from the research paper titled "VGMShield: Mitigating Misuse of Video Generative Models" by Yan Pang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their methods on two publicly available high-quality video datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to see if the authors provide any specific names or descriptions of the datasets. The introduction discusses the context of video generation and the need for detection and tracing methods, but it does not explicitly name the datasets.

I will then examine **section 3 (Methodology)** and **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors are likely to detail the datasets used for their experiments. In section 3.3.1, they mention using two datasets for their experiments, which are:

1. **WebVid-10M**: This dataset is described as a comprehensive collection comprising 10 million video clips totaling 52,000 hours, each accompanied by descriptive text. It is noted for its scale and diversity, making it a valuable resource for training and evaluating machine learning models.

2. **InternVid**: This dataset is characterized as a large-scale, video-centric multimodal dataset designed to facilitate learning robust and transferable video-text representations. It includes over 7 million videos with a cumulative duration of nearly 760,000 hours, accompanied by text descriptions totaling approximately 4.1 billion words.

To confirm the details and obtain full citations for these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **WebVid-10M**, the citation is:
  > Bain, M., Nagrani, A., Varol, G., & Zisserman, A. (2021). *Frozen in time: A joint video and image encoder for end-to-end retrieval*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision.

- For **InternVid**, the citation is:
  > Wang, Y., He, Y., Li, Y., Li, K., Yu, J., Ma, X., Li, X., Chen, G., Chen, X., Wang, Y., He, C., Luo, P., Liu, Z., Wang, Y., Wang, L., & Qiao, Y. (2024). *InternVid: A large-scale video-text dataset for multimodal understanding and generation*.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
