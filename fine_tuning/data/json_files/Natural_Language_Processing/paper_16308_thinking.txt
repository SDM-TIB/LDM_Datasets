To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Algorithmic Fairness Generalization Under Covariate and Dependence Shifts Simultaneously" by Chen Zhao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that "extensive empirical studies on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods." This indicates that datasets are indeed used, and I need to find their names.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **Datasets** section, which is likely to provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the experiments. In this paper, I find a table summarizing the datasets, which includes:

1. **ccMNIST**: A domain generalization benchmark created by colorizing digits and backgrounds of the MNIST dataset. It consists of images of handwritten digits from 0 to 9, with specific labels based on digit ranges.

2. **FairFace**: A dataset containing a balanced representation of different racial groups, including 108,501 images from seven racial categories: Black, East Asian, Indian, Latino, Middle Eastern, Southeast Asian, and White.

3. **YFCC100M-FDG**: An image dataset created by Yahoo Labs, consisting of 90,000 images divided into three domains based on year ranges, with tags for indoor/outdoor classification.

4. **NYSF**: A real-world dataset on policing in New York City, documenting pedestrian stop records across five different regions, with race as a sensitive attribute.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- **ccMNIST**:

In ICML, 2021.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
