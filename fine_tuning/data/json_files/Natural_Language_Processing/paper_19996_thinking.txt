To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Tracking-in-range Formulations for Numerical Optimal Control" by Nikilesh Ramesh et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections that discuss experiments or numerical examples**. The abstract provides a high-level overview, but the introduction and subsequent sections are likely to contain specific references to datasets used in the research.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the concept of tracking-in-range problems and mention practical applications, but they do not explicitly name any datasets. I will need to look for sections that detail experiments or numerical examples, as these are typically where datasets are referenced.

Next, I will focus on **section 6 (Numerical Examples)**, which describes two example problems. Here, the authors detail the dynamics and objectives of the tracking problems but do not explicitly mention any datasets. Instead, they refer to the use of a toolbox (ICLOCS2) for solving the optimal control problems, which may imply that the datasets are generated or simulated rather than sourced from existing datasets.

Since no specific datasets are mentioned in the paper, I will check the **References section** to see if any external datasets are cited that could be relevant to the experiments. However, the references primarily consist of foundational texts and papers related to optimal control and do not indicate any datasets.

Given that the paper does not provide explicit datasets, I will conclude that there are no datasets to extract for this particular research paper. If there were datasets mentioned, I would ensure to document each dataset's name, description, and full citation as per the required format.

In summary, I will compile my findings, noting that no datasets were explicitly mentioned in the paper, and therefore, there are no citations to provide.
