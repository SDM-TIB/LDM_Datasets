To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Addressing Data Heterogeneity in Federated Learning of Cox Proportional Hazards Models" by Navid Seidi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental results sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the use of the **Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database**, which indicates that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any additional datasets or details about the SEER database. The introduction discusses the need for personalized strategies in healthcare and mentions the SEER database again, confirming its relevance to the study.

In the **methodology section**, I will look for any specific details about how the SEER dataset is utilized. The authors describe using the SEER dataset to validate their federated learning approach, which reinforces its importance in their experiments.

Moving to the **experimental results section**, I will check for any additional datasets mentioned. The authors provide results based on the SEER dataset, comparing various methods and highlighting the improvements achieved through their approach.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citation for the SEER dataset. The citation is as follows:
> National Cancer Institute. "Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program." Available: https://seer.cancer.gov/, 2023.

Since the SEER database is the primary dataset referenced in the paper, I will document it accordingly.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring that I include the full citation for the SEER dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the dataset used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
