To extract datasets from the research paper titled "PIPE: Parallelized Inference Through Post-Training Quantization" by Edouard Yvinec et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. In the abstract, the authors mention that PIPE achieves superior performance on various benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved. I will look for specific names of datasets or references to well-known datasets in these sections.

Next, I will proceed to the **methodology** and **experiments** sections, particularly focusing on any subsections that discuss datasets or experimental setups. In section 4.1, titled "Implementation Details and Benchmarks," the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for evaluation:

1. **ImageNet**: A large-scale dataset for image classification containing approximately 1.2 million images for training and 50,000 for testing.
2. **Pascal VOC 2012**: A dataset for object detection with around 17,000 images in the test set.
3. **CityScapes**: A dataset for semantic segmentation with 500 validation images.

These datasets are crucial for understanding the performance of the PIPE method, as they are commonly used benchmarks in the field.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:

- For **ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > J. Deng, W. Dong, et al. "ImageNet: A Large-Scale Hierarchical Image Database." In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2009.

- For **Pascal VOC 2012**, the citation is:
  > M. Everingham, L. Van Gool, C. K. I. Williams, J. Winn, and A. Zisserman. "The Pascal Visual Object Classes Challenge 2012 (VOC2012) Results." Available at: http://www.pascal-network.org/challenges/VOC/voc2012/workshop/index.html, 2012.

- For **CityScapes**, the citation is:
  > M. Cordts, M. Omran, S. Ramos, T. Rehfeld, M. Enzweiler, R. Benenson, U. Franke, S. Roth, and B. Schiele. "The Cityscapes Dataset for Semantic Urban Scene Understanding." In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2016.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or analysis. This will ensure that I have a clear record of the datasets utilized in the research and their respective references.
