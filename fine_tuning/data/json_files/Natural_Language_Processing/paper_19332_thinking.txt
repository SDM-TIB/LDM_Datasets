To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Formal Synthesis of Controllers for Safety-Critical Autonomous Systems: Developments and Challenges" by Xiang Yin, Bingzhao Gao, and Xiao Yu, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract provides a high-level overview, while the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the research, which may include references to datasets used in the study.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets or experiments**. In many research papers, authors will explicitly mention the datasets they used for their experiments, including details about their size, type, and source. If such a section exists, it will be crucial for gathering accurate information.

If the paper does not have a specific section for datasets, I will check the **results and discussion sections**. Authors often refer to datasets when discussing their findings, which can provide insights into the datasets used.

Once I identify the datasets, I will ensure to note down their names and any relevant details provided in the paper, such as the number of samples, types of data, and specific applications.

After gathering the dataset information, I will consult the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is important for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like "XYZ Dataset," I will look for its citation in the references, which might look something like this:
> Author(s). *Title of the Dataset*. Year. URL or DOI if available.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant dataset information from the paper.
