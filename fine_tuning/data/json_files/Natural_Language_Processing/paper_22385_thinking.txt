To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fast and Controllable Post-training Sparsity: Learning Optimal Sparsity Allocation with Global Constraint in Minutes" by Ruihao Gong et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the efficiency of the proposed method and hints at its application on various datasets, which suggests that datasets will be discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as this is typically where datasets are explicitly mentioned. In this paper, the authors conduct experiments on multiple datasets, including:

1. **CIFAR-10**: A well-known dataset consisting of 50,000 training images and 10,000 testing images across 10 classes.
2. **CIFAR-100**: Similar to CIFAR-10 but with 100 classes, containing 50,000 training images and 10,000 testing images.
3. **ImageNet**: A large-scale dataset with approximately 1.2 million training images and 50,000 testing images, categorized into 1,000 classes.
4. **PASCAL VOC**: A dataset used for object detection, containing 20 object categories with bounding box annotations.

I will also check the **results section** to confirm that these datasets are indeed used for evaluation and to gather any additional details about their usage.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **CIFAR-10**:
  > Krizhevsky, A., Hinton, G., et al. (2009). *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. 

- For **CIFAR-100**:
  > Krizhevsky, A., Hinton, G., et al. (2009). *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*.

- For **ImageNet**:
  > Russakovsky, O., Deng, J., Su, H., Krause, J., Satheesh, S., Ma, S., Huang, Z., Karpathy, A., Khosla, A., Bernstein, M., et al. (2015). *ImageNet large scale visual recognition challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 115: 211–252.

- For **PASCAL VOC**:
  > Everingham, M., Gool, L. V., Williams, C. K. I., Winn, J. M., and Zisserman, A. (2010). *The Pascal Visual Object Classes (VOC) Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 88(2): 303–338.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
