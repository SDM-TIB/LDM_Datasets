To extract datasets from the research paper titled "LTAU–FF: Loss Trajectory Analysis for Uncertainty in Atomistic Force Fields" by Joshua A. Vita et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors apply their method to multiple datasets, which suggests that there are specific datasets to look for.

Next, I will focus on the **Methods section**, particularly **section 3.2 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used in their work. Here, they mention three datasets:

1. **3BPA Dataset**: This dataset is described as a molecular dataset consisting of 500 training configurations from molecular dynamics simulations at 300 K, totaling 13,500 training points. The authors reference the dataset with the citation:
   > KOK+21: Joshua A. Vita, et al. "3BPA Dataset." In Proceedings of the 2021 Conference on Machine Learning and Chemistry.

2. **Carbon GAP 20 Dataset**: This dataset is noted for its diversity, including various carbon phases, with a training set of 6,088 configurations and 400,275 atoms. The citation for this dataset is:
   > RDG+20: Patrick Rowe, et al. "An accurate and transferable machine learning potential for carbon." The Journal of Chemical Physics, 153(3): July 2020.

3. **OC20 Dataset**: The authors mention using the 200k split of the S2EF task from the OC20 challenge, which includes 14,631,937 atoms. The citation for this dataset is:
   > CDG+21b: Lowik Chanussot, et al. "Open Catalyst 2020 (OC20) dataset and community challenges." ACS Catalysis, 11(10):6059–6072, May 2021.

After identifying these datasets, I will verify the citations by checking the **References section** of the paper to ensure accuracy.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including their descriptions and citations, into a structured format for further use. This will ensure that I have a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research, along with their proper citations for any future references or applications.
