To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Emerging Advancements in 6G NTN Radio Access Technologies: An Overview" by Husnain Shahid et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I identify and accurately cite any datasets mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections that discuss methodologies or experiments** to look for any references to datasets. The abstract provides a high-level overview, and while it may not mention specific datasets, it sets the context for the research.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to see if the authors mention any datasets that are critical for their analysis or experiments. This section often outlines the background and significance of the research, which may include references to existing datasets.

I will then examine the **methodology and results sections** to identify any datasets used in the experiments or analyses. These sections typically provide detailed descriptions of the datasets, including their characteristics, size, and how they were utilized in the research.

If the paper includes a **dedicated section on datasets**, I will pay close attention to it, as it will likely contain explicit mentions of the datasets used, along with their descriptions.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like the "6G NTN Dataset," I will look for the original source or publication that describes this dataset in detail. If the dataset is derived from a previous study, I will ensure to cite that original work.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset information in a structured format for easy reference, ensuring that all citations are complete and accurate.
