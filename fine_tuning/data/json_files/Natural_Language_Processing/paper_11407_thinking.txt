To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Private Prediction Strikes Back! Private Kernelized Nearest Neighbors with Individual R´enyi Filter" by Yuqing Zhu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for evaluation. In this case, the authors discuss their method's performance on various vision and language tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this paper, they mention using two specific datasets for image classification and two for text classification:

1. **CIFAR-10**: This is a well-known dataset consisting of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes. The authors use it to evaluate their method's performance on image classification tasks.

2. **Fashion MNIST**: This dataset contains 70,000 grayscale images of clothing items, also used for benchmarking image classification algorithms.

3. **AG News**: A dataset for text classification that consists of news articles categorized into four classes. It is commonly used for evaluating text classification models.

4. **DBPedia**: This dataset is derived from Wikipedia and is used for various natural language processing tasks, including text classification.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for the datasets used in the research.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton, et al. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. Technical report, 2009.

- For **Fashion MNIST**, the citation is:
  > Han Xiao, Kashif Rasul, and Roland Vollgraf. *Fashion-MNIST: A novel image dataset for benchmarking machine learning algorithms*. ArXiv, abs/1708.07747, 2017.

- For **AG News**, the citation is:
  > Xiang Zhang, Junbo Jake Zhao, and Yann LeCun. *Character-level convolutional networks for text classification*. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 2015.

- For **DBPedia**, the citation is:
  > Jens Lehmann, Robert Isele, Max Jakob, Anja Jentzsch, Dimitris Kontokostas, Pablo N. Mendes, Sebastian Hellmann, Mohamed Morsey, Patrick van Kleef, S. Auer, and Christian Bizer. *DBpedia - a large-scale, multilingual knowledge base extracted from Wikipedia*. Semantic Web, 6:167–195, 2015.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
