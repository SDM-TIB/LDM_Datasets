To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An Empirical Study of Catastrophic Forgetting in Large Language Models During Continual Fine-tuning" by Yun Luo et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of catastrophic forgetting in large language models (LLMs) during continual instruction tuning, which suggests that specific datasets may be used for this evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly the subsections that detail the continual tasks and evaluation tasks. In this section, the authors describe the specific tasks and datasets used to evaluate the models. 

1. **Instruction Tasks**: The paper lists five instruction tasks, each associated with specific datasets:
   - **Text Simplification**: The dataset used is from Jiang et al. (2020) and Alva-Manchego et al. (2020).
   - **Empathetic Dialogue Generation**: The dataset is from Rashkin et al. (2019).
   - **Inquisitive Question Generation**: The dataset is from Fan et al. (2019).
   - **Explanation Generation**: The dataset is from Camburu et al. (2018).
   - **Headline Generation**: The dataset is from Scialom et al. (2022).

2. **Evaluation Tasks**: The paper also mentions several evaluation datasets:
   - **Domain Knowledge**: The Massive Multitask Language Understanding benchmark (MMLU) is referenced, which is detailed in Hendrycks et al. (2020).
   - **Reasoning**: Several datasets are used, including:
     - **Hellaswag**: Zellers et al. (2019)
     - **BoolQ**: Clark et al. (2019)
     - **Winogrande**: Sakaguchi et al. (2021)
     - **PIQA**: Bisk et al. (2020)
     - **MathQA**: Amini et al. (2019)
     - **Mutual**: Cui et al. (2020)
   - **Reading Comprehension**: The RACE dataset is used, as described by Lai et al. (2017).
   - **Bias**: The CrowS-Pairs dataset is referenced, which is detailed in Nangia et al. (2020).

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to ensure I have the full citations for each dataset mentioned.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use.
