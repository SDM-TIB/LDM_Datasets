To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Exploring Richer and More Accurate Information via Frequency Selection for Image Restoration" by Hu Gao and Depeng Dang, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, while the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the advancements in image restoration and the importance of utilizing large-scale datasets for training deep learning models. However, I need to look for specific dataset names.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly the subsection labeled **Datasets**. Here, the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for training and evaluation. They describe the datasets in detail, including the number of images, types of images, and any specific characteristics relevant to the experiments.

From the text, I identify the following datasets:

1. **GoPro Dataset**: This dataset includes 2,103 image pairs for training and 1,111 pairs for evaluation, specifically designed for image motion deblurring.
2. **HIDE Dataset**: This dataset consists of 2,025 images used for evaluating the generalizability of the model trained on the GoPro dataset.
3. **RealBlur Dataset**: This dataset contains image pairs captured under real-world conditions, divided into two subsets: RealBlur-J and RealBlur-R.
4. **DPDD Dataset**: This dataset comprises images from 500 indoor/outdoor scenes captured with a DSLR camera, used for single-image defocus deblurring.
5. **Rain datasets**: The authors mention using 13,712 clean-rain image pairs collected from multiple datasets for image deraining, including Rain100H and Rain100L.
6. **Composite Dataset for Denoising**: This dataset includes images from DIV2K, Flickr2K, BSD500, and WED, used for training the model to handle various noise levels.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
