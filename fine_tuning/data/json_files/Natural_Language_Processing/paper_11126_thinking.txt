To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Recent Advances of Local Mechanisms in Computer Vision: A Survey and Outlook of Recent Work" by Qiangchang Wang and Yilong Yin, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and relevant sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a general overview, but the introduction and subsequent sections often contain specific references to datasets used in the research.

Next, I will look for sections that explicitly mention datasets, such as **"Datasets," "Experiments," or "Methodology."** In this paper, there are no specific datasets mentioned in the abstract or introduction, which suggests that the authors may not have used specific datasets for their survey but rather discussed various approaches and mechanisms.

I will also check the **References section** for any cited datasets or related works that may have used specific datasets. However, since this paper is a survey, it may not have original datasets but rather references existing datasets used in the literature.

If I find any datasets mentioned, I will ensure to extract the full citation for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and for readers who may want to access the datasets for their own research.

After identifying the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and ease of use.

In this case, since the paper primarily discusses local mechanisms and does not focus on specific datasets, I may conclude that there are no datasets to extract. However, I will still document any relevant references to datasets mentioned in the context of the surveyed literature.
