To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DealMVC: Dual Contrastive Calibration for Multi-view Clustering" by Xihong Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments across eight benchmark datasets, which indicates that there are multiple datasets to extract.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors provide a summary of the datasets used. In **section 4.1**, they list the eight benchmark datasets along with some statistics about each. This section is crucial as it provides both the names of the datasets and their characteristics.

The datasets mentioned are:

1. **BBCSport**: 544 samples, 5 clusters, 2 views.
2. **Reuters**: 1200 samples, 6 clusters, 5 views.
3. **Caltech101_7**: 1400 samples, 7 clusters, 5 views.
4. **Cora**: 2708 samples, 7 clusters, 4 views.
5. **Wiki**: 2866 samples, 10 clusters, 2 views.
6. **Hdigit**: 9144 samples, 10 clusters, 5 views.
7. **Caltech101**: 10000 samples, 10 clusters, 2 views.
8. **STL10**: 13000 samples, 10 clusters, 4 views.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. The paper does not provide specific citations for each dataset directly, but I can look for the original sources or commonly accepted references for these datasets based on my knowledge.

The likely citations for these datasets are:

- **BBCSport**:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This structured approach will help in accurately documenting the datasets used in the research paper.
