To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Fair Policies for Multi-stage Selection Problems from Observational Data" by Zhuangzhuang Jia et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of observational data in learning fair policies, which suggests that datasets are involved, but I need to find specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their computational experiments. In this section, they mention using datasets adapted from the UCI repository, specifically:

1. **Adult Dataset**: This dataset is used to predict whether a person's annual income exceeds $50,000 based on demographic characteristics. It contains 32,561 samples and 12 features, with gender as the sensitive attribute.

2. **German Credit Dataset**: This dataset consists of samples of bank account holders with good or bad credit. It includes 1,000 samples and 19 features, with gender as the sensitive attribute.

3. **COMPAS Dataset**: This dataset is used to predict recidivism risk and contains 6,172 samples. The sensitive attribute in this dataset is ethnicity.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **Adult Dataset**:
  > Kohavi, R., et al. (1996). *Scaling up the accuracy of naive-bayes classifiers: A decision-tree hybrid*. In KDD, volume 96, pages 202–207.

- For the **German Credit Dataset**:
  > Dua, D., & Graff, C. (2019). *UCI Machine Learning Repository*. University of California, School of Information and Computer Science, Irvine, CA.

- For the **COMPAS Dataset**:
  > Angwin, J., Larson, J., Mattu, S., & Kirchner, L. (2022). *Machine bias*. In Ethics of data and analytics, pages 254–264. Auerbach Publications.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations into a structured format for further processing.
