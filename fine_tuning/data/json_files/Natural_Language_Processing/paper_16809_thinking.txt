To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The Role of Net-Zero Energy Residential Buildings in Floridaâ€™s Energy Transition: Economic Analysis and Technical Benefits" by Hamed Haggi and James M. Fenton, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a summary of the research focus, which may hint at the datasets used for analysis. The introduction often outlines the context and significance of the research, potentially mentioning specific datasets or sources of data.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets or methodology** where the authors might describe the data sources, types of data collected, and any specific datasets utilized in their analysis. This section is crucial as it typically contains detailed information about the datasets, including their names, characteristics, and how they were used in the study.

I will also check the **results and discussion sections** for any references to datasets that were analyzed or compared. The authors may discuss the implications of their findings based on the datasets, which can provide additional context and confirmation of the datasets used.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This is important for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, if the authors mention using data from the **National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL)** or specific studies on energy consumption, I will ensure to note the full citation for those sources.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference.

In summary, my steps will be:
1. Read the abstract, introduction, and methodology sections for initial dataset mentions.
2. Look for a dedicated section on datasets or methodology for detailed descriptions.
3. Check results and discussion sections for additional dataset references.
4. Consult the References section for full citations of each dataset.
5. Compile the dataset information into a structured format for clarity and accessibility.
