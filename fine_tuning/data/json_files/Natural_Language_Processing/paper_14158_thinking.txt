To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Affect Recognition in Conversations Using Large Language Models" by Shutong Feng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. In the abstract, the authors explicitly state that they leverage three diverse datasets: **IEMOCAP**, **EmoWOZ**, and **DAIC-WOZ**. This indicates that these datasets are central to the research.

Next, I will look into the **methodology** and **experimental setup** sections, particularly section 4, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used. Here’s what I will find:

1. **IEMOCAP**: This dataset is described as a multi-modal corpus designed for Emotion Recognition in Conversations (ERC). It consists of 151 dialogues with 10,039 utterances from 10 distinct speakers. Each utterance is annotated with one of nine emotion classes.

2. **EmoWOZ**: This dataset is a text-based ERC corpus built for emotion recognition in task-oriented dialogues. It includes 10,438 human-human dialogues and 1,000 human-machine dialogues, covering seven distinct user emotions.

3. **DAIC-WOZ**: This is a speech-based corpus for depression detection, which includes clinical interviews and the Patient Health Questionnaire-8 (PHQ-8) scores of 193 interviews.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for each dataset:

- For **IEMOCAP**, the citation is:
  > Busso, C., Bulut, M., Lee, C.-C., Kazemzadeh, A., Mower, E., Kim, S., Chang, J. N., Lee, S., & Narayanan, S. S. (2008). IEMOCAP: Interactive emotional dyadic motion capture database. *Language Resources and Evaluation*, 42(4), 335–359.

- For **EmoWOZ**, the citation is:
  > Feng, S., Lubis, N., Geishauser, C., Lin, H.-C., Heck, M., van Niekerk, C., & Gašić, M. (2022). EmoWOZ: A large-scale corpus and labelling scheme for emotion recognition in task-oriented dialogue systems. In *Proceedings of the Thirteenth Language Resources and Evaluation Conference* (pp. 4096–4113). Marseille, France: European Language Resources Association.

- For **DAIC-WOZ**, the citation is:
  > Gratch, J., Artstein, R., Lucas, G., Stratou, G., Scherer, S., Nazarian, A., Wood, R., Boberg, J., DeVault, D., Marsella, S., & Traum, D. (2014). The distress analysis interview corpus of human and computer interviews. In *Proceedings of the Ninth International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation* (LREC’14) (pp. 3123–3128). Reykjavik, Iceland: European Language Resources Association (ELRA).

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
