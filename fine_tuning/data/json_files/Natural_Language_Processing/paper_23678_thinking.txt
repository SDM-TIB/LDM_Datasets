To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Dynamic Uncertain Causality Graph for Computer-Aided General Clinical Diagnoses" by Zhan Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the DUCG approach and its application in clinical diagnosis, but it does not explicitly mention datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine **section 5 (Real-World Applications)**, where the authors discuss the application of 46 DUCG models verified by third-party hospitals. This section is likely to contain information about the datasets used for these models. The authors mention that these models cover over 1,000 diseases and include more than 10,000 ICD-10 disease codes, which indicates a large dataset.

I will also look for any **tables or figures** that might summarize the datasets or provide specific details about the diseases included in the DUCG models. For instance, the authors reference a table that lists the chief complaints and the corresponding diseases, which could be crucial for understanding the datasets used.

In **section 4 (Third-Party Verifications on Diagnostic Precisions)**, the authors describe the verification process involving case records from third-party hospitals. They mention that they verified 46 DUCG models covering 54 chief complaints and more than 1,000 diseases. This suggests that the datasets used for verification are derived from real clinical case records, which are essential for understanding the practical application of the DUCG models.

Now, I will compile the full citations for the datasets mentioned in the paper. The authors reference several studies and datasets throughout the text, particularly in the context of the DUCG models and their verification. I will ensure to include the following citations:

1. For the DUCG models and their application in clinical settings, I will cite:
   > Zhang Q, Bu X, Zhang Z, Zhang M, Hu J (2021) Dynamic uncertain causality graph for computer-aided general clinical diagnoses with nasal obstruction as an illustration. *Artificial Intelligence Review* 54:27–61.

2. For the verification of the DUCG models, I will reference:
   > Zhang Z, Jiao Y et al (2022) AI-aided general clinical diagnoses verified by third-parties with dynamic uncertain causality graph extended to also include classification. *Artificial Intelligence Review* 55:4485–4521.

3. Additionally, I will include citations for the studies that provide context for the datasets used, such as:
   > Rajpurkar P, Chen E, Banerjee O, Topol EJ (2022) AI in health and medicine. *Nature Medicine* 28:31–38.

After gathering all relevant information and citations, I will summarize the datasets in a clear format, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its corresponding citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper, which is crucial for understanding the study's findings and implications.
