To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Generating Benchmarks for Factuality Evaluation of Language Models" by Dor Muhlgay et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors created three benchmarks: **Wiki-FACTOR**, **News-FACTOR**, and **Expert-FACTOR**. This is a strong indication that these datasets will be discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **Methods** section, particularly **section 3 (The FACTOR Evaluation Approach)**, where the authors describe how they generated the datasets. Here, they mention that they applied their framework to Wikipedia and news domains, leading to the creation of the three benchmarks.

In **section 3.3 (Applying FACTOR to Knowledge Intensive Domains)**, the authors provide specific details about each dataset:

1. **Wiki-FACTOR**: This dataset is based on the Wikipedia section of The Pileâ€™s validation split, containing 2,994 examples.
2. **News-FACTOR**: This dataset is derived from Reuters articles published after January 10, 2021, and consists of 1,036 examples.
3. **Expert-FACTOR**: This dataset is based on the validation and test splits of ExpertQA, containing 236 examples.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **Wiki-FACTOR**, the citation is:
  > Gao, L., Biderman, S., Black, S., Golding, L., Hoppe, T., Foster, C., Phang, J., He, H., Thite, A., Nabeshima, N., Presser, S., and Leahy, C. (2021). *The Pile: An 800GB dataset of diverse text for language modeling*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2101.00027.

- For **News-FACTOR**, the citation is:
  > Penedo, G., Malartic, Q., Hesslow, D., Cojocaru, R., Cappelli, A., Alobeidli, H., Pannier, B., Almazrouei, E., and Launay, J. (2023). *The RefinedWeb dataset for Falcon LLM: outperforming curated corpora with web data, and web data only*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2305.00001.

- For **Expert-FACTOR**, the citation is:
  > Malaviya, C., Lee, S., Chen, S., Sieber, E., Yatskar, M., and Roth, D. (2023). *ExpertQA: Expert-curated questions and attributed answers*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2305.00002.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their full citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their sources as required.
