To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Tail Bounds on the Runtime of Categorical Compact Genetic Algorithm" by Ryoki Hamano et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract typically provides a summary of the research, and if datasets are used, they are often mentioned here. I will look for specific names or descriptions of datasets.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** in detail, as this is where authors usually describe the datasets used for their experiments. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and any relevant characteristics.

If the paper includes a **datasets section**, I will focus on that as it will likely contain detailed descriptions of each dataset used in the research. I will note down the names, sizes, and any specific attributes or splits mentioned for each dataset.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial as it provides the necessary context and source for the datasets used in the research. I will ensure to capture the authors, title, publication venue, and year for each dataset.

For example, if the paper mentions the "Penn Action Dataset" and provides a citation, I will extract that citation in full. Similarly, if the "JHMDB Dataset" is mentioned, I will look for its citation as well.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that I maintain clarity and accuracy in the representation of each dataset.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for any required output format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly defined and properly cited, ready for further processing or review.
