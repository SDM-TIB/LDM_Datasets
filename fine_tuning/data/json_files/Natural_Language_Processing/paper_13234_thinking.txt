To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A survey on bias in machine learning research" by Agnieszka Mikołajczyk-Bareła and Michał Grochowski, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's focus on bias in machine learning, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any references to datasets used in the survey or examples of bias. The introduction discusses the importance of understanding bias in machine learning but does not specify any datasets.

I will then look into the **related works section** to see if any datasets are cited in the context of previous research on bias. This section may provide insights into datasets that have been used in related studies.

Moving on to the **sources of bias at different stages of research** section, I will carefully analyze the text for any datasets that are mentioned as examples of bias in machine learning. This section outlines various biases but does not seem to provide specific datasets.

Finally, I will check the **references section** for any datasets that may have been cited throughout the paper. This is crucial as it may contain full citations for datasets that were used in the studies referenced by the authors.

After reviewing the entire paper, I will compile a list of datasets mentioned, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset. If no specific datasets are identified, I will note that the paper primarily discusses bias without providing concrete datasets.

In summary, my steps will be:
1. Read the abstract, introduction, and methodology sections for mentions of datasets.
2. Check the related works section for any cited datasets.
3. Analyze the sources of bias section for examples of datasets.
4. Review the references section for full citations of any datasets mentioned.
5. Compile the findings into a structured format, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset identified.

By following these steps, I will ensure a thorough extraction of any datasets referenced in the paper, along with their proper citations.
