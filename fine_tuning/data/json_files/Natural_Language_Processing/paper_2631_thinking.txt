To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Robust and Consistent Estimation of Word Embedding for Bangla Language by Fine-tuning Word2Vec Model" by Rifat Rahman, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of word embeddings for Bangla language and mentions evaluations, but does not specify datasets. The introduction elaborates on the need for effective word embeddings but does not provide specific dataset names either.

Next, I will examine **section III (Methodology)**, particularly the **Corpus Creation** subsection. Here, the author describes the corpus created from various online news portals and Wikipedia, which includes articles from different categories such as politics, education, and technology. This indicates that the corpus itself is a dataset used for training the Word2Vec model.

In the **Corpus Creation** subsection, the author states that they collected data from several popular online news portals in Bangladesh, including Prothom Alo and Kaler Kantho, and Wikipedia. The total number of articles in the corpus is reported as 243,741, which is a significant dataset for the study.

I will also look at the **Extrinsic Evaluation** subsection, where the author mentions building a labeled dataset from the corpus for a news article classifier. This dataset maps articles to five categories: state, international, economy, sports, and entertainment, and consists of 100,000 news articles. This is another dataset that is explicitly mentioned.

Now, I will compile the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. **Bangla News Corpus**: The corpus created from various online news portals and Wikipedia, consisting of 243,741 articles. The citation for this dataset is not explicitly provided in the paper, but I can summarize it as:
   > Rifat Rahman. *Bangla News Corpus*. Collected from various online news portals in Bangladesh and Wikipedia, 2015-2020.

2. **Labeled News Article Dataset**: A labeled dataset created from the corpus for the purpose of training a news article classifier, consisting of 100,000 articles. The citation for this dataset is also not explicitly provided, but can be summarized as:
   > Rifat Rahman. *Labeled News Article Dataset*. Derived from the Bangla News Corpus for classification tasks, 2020.

After gathering this information, I will prepare to format the dataset entries according to the required structure, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as specified.
