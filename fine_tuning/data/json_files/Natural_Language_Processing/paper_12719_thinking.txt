To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-interactive Feature Learning and a Full-time Multi-modality Benchmark for Image Fusion and Segmentation" by Jinyuan Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors constructed a "full-time multi-modality benchmark with 15 annotated pixel-level categories," which suggests that a dataset is being introduced.

Next, I will look closely at **section 4 (Full-time Multi-modality Benchmark)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset they created. Here, they describe the FMB dataset, which contains 1500 well-registered infrared and visible image pairs with 15 annotated pixel-level categories. This section will provide the necessary details about the dataset's composition and purpose.

In addition, I will check the **experiments section** to see if any other datasets are mentioned. The authors refer to using the **MFNet** dataset alongside their proposed FMB dataset for training and evaluation. This indicates that both datasets are relevant to their research.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper:

1. **FMB Dataset**: The authors do not provide a specific citation for the FMB dataset since it is newly introduced in this paper. However, I will note that it is a benchmark created by the authors themselves.

2. **MFNet Dataset**: The citation for the MFNet dataset is:
   > Qishen Ha, Kohei Watanabe, Takumi Karasawa, Yoshitaka Ushiku, and Tatsuya Harada. *MFNet: Towards Real-Time Semantic Segmentation for Autonomous Vehicles with Multi-Spectral Scenes*. In IROS, pages 5108â€“5115. IEEE, 2017.

After collecting this information, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

- **FMB Dataset**: A newly created dataset consisting of 1500 aligned infrared and visible image pairs with 15 annotated pixel-level categories, aimed at promoting research in image fusion and segmentation.

- **MFNet Dataset**: A dataset used for training and evaluation in the context of multi-spectral scenes, which is essential for the experiments conducted in this paper.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly presents each dataset along with its citation, ensuring that all details are accurately captured for future reference or analysis.
