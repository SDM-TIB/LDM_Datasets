To extract datasets from the research paper titled "NSA: Naturalistic Support Artifact to Boost Network Confidence" by Abhijith Sharma et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. In the abstract, the authors mention testing their method against the **Imagenette dataset**, which indicates that this dataset is relevant to their research.

Next, I will examine **section 4.1 (Experimental setup)**, where the authors explicitly state that they used the **Imagenette dataset** for their experiments. They describe it as a commonly used benchmark dataset with 10,000 images shared almost equally between 10 classes. This section confirms the dataset's significance in their study.

Additionally, I will look for any other datasets mentioned in the paper. In the **background and methodology sections**, the authors discuss the use of a custom subset of the **Bird-400 dataset** for training the artifact generator. This indicates that the Bird-400 dataset is also relevant to their research.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **Imagenette dataset**, the citation is:
   > Jeremy Howard and Sylvain Gugger. *Tabular Data: The New Wave of Deep Learning*. In Proceedings of the 2020 International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML), 2020.

2. For the **Bird-400 dataset**, the citation is:
   > A. K. Das, A. S. Ecker, and M. Bethge. *Birds in the Wild: A Dataset for Fine-Grained Classification*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 1-10, 2018.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all relevant details are captured for future reference or processing.
