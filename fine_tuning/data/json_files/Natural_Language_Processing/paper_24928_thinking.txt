To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Large Language Models for Judicial Entity Extraction: A Comparative Study" by Atin S. Hussain and Anu Thomas, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) for entity recognition in legal texts, but it does not specify any datasets at this point. The introduction elaborates on the importance of domain-specific entity recognition but also does not mention specific datasets.

Next, I will examine **section 5.1 (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors mention evaluating the models on the **InLegalNER dataset**. This section provides a clear indication of a dataset used in their experiments. I will take note of the details provided about this dataset, including its purpose and the types of entities it encompasses.

In **Table 1**, the paper outlines the various entities included in the InLegalNER dataset, such as COURT, PETITIONER, RESPONDENT, and others, along with their occurrence percentages. This information is crucial for understanding the dataset's scope and application.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the InLegalNER dataset. The citation is provided as follows:
- For the **InLegalNER dataset**, the citation is:
  > Kalamkar, P., Agarwal, A., Tiwari, A., Gupta, S., Karn, S., Raghavan, V. (2022). Named Entity Recognition in Indian court judgments. In Proceedings of the Natural Legal Language Processing Workshop 2022, Association for Computational Linguistics, Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates (Hybrid), pp. 184â€“193.

Since this is the only dataset explicitly mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information regarding the InLegalNER dataset, including its citation, into the required format.

After gathering all necessary information, I will prepare the dataset entry for the InLegalNER dataset, ensuring that the citation is included correctly. This will allow for proper referencing and acknowledgment of the dataset used in the research.
