To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Investigating Consistency in Query-Based Meeting Summarization: A Comparative Study of Different Embedding Methods" by Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors are using a dataset called **QMSum**, which is a benchmark for query-based multi-domain meeting summarization. This is a strong lead that suggests a dataset is central to their research.

Next, I will focus on the **dataset section (III)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the QMSum dataset. They mention that it consists of **1808 query-summary pairs over 232 meetings** and that it is used to train their Locator model. This section also describes how the dataset was constructed, including the process of creating general and specific questions for each meeting, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's structure and purpose.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the QMSum dataset. The authors cite the original paper that introduced the QMSum dataset as follows:

- **QMSum Dataset Citation**:
  > M. Zhong et al., “QMSum: A New Benchmark for Query-based Multi-domain Meeting Summarization.” arXiv, Apr. 13, 2021. Accessed: Jun. 05, 2023. [Online]. Available: http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.05938

Since the QMSum dataset is the only dataset explicitly mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and full citation.

Finally, I will ensure that all extracted information is accurate and clearly presented, ready for any further processing or review.
