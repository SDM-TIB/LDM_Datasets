To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Semantic Density: Uncertainty Quantification in Semantic Space for Large Language Models" by Xin Qiu and Risto Miikkulainen, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions experiments on "four free-form question-answering benchmarks," indicating that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they mention four specific datasets:

1. **CoQA**: The paper states that the coqa-dev-v1.0 version is used, which includes 1,596 questions randomly selected for the experiments.

2. **TriviaQA**: The authors indicate that 1,705 questions were randomly selected from the validation split of this dataset.

3. **SciQ**: The test split from a specific GitHub repository is used, containing 990 questions.

4. **Natural Questions (NQ)**: The authors mention that 1,800 questions were randomly selected from the test split of this dataset.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. Here are the full citations for each dataset:

- For **CoQA**, the citation is:
  > Siva Reddy, Danqi Chen, and Christopher D. Manning. *CoQA: A Conversational Question Answering Challenge*. Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics 7 (2019), 249–266. https://doi.org/10.1162/tacl_a_00266

- For **TriviaQA**, the citation is:

- For **SciQ**, the citation is:
  > Johannes Welbl, Nelson F. Liu, and Matt Gardner. *Crowdsourcing Multiple Choice Science Questions*. arXiv:1707.06209 [cs.HC], 2017.

- For **Natural Questions (NQ)**, the citation is:

Toutanova, Llion Jones, Ming-Wei Chang, Andrew Dai, Jakob Uszkoreit, Quoc Le, and Slav Petrov. *Natural Questions: a Benchmark for Question Answering Research*. Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics (2019).

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
