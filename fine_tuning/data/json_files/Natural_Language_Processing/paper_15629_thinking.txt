To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Crosslingual Retrieval Augmented In-context Learning for Bangla" by Xiaoqian Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of cross-lingual retrieval augmented in-context learning for Bangla tasks, which suggests that datasets are likely involved in the evaluation of their approach.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges faced by low-resource languages like Bangla and mention the need for labeled datasets. This indicates that they may reference specific datasets later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe the tasks they evaluated. Here, they explicitly mention several datasets used for classification and summarization tasks:

1. **Vio-Lens Dataset**: This dataset contains YouTube comments related to violent incidents in the Bengal region, aimed at identifying potential threats. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Sourav Saha, Jahedul Alam Junaed, Maryam Saleki, Arnab Sen Sharma, Mohammad Rashidujjaman Rifat, Mohamed Rahout, Syed Ishtiaque Ahmed, Nabeel Mohammad, and Mohammad Ruhul Amin. *Vio-lens: A novel dataset of annotated social network posts leading to different forms of communal violence and its evaluation*. In Proceedings of the 1st International Workshop on Bangla Language Processing (BLP-2023), Singapore. Association for Computational Linguistics.

2. **ETHOS Dataset**: This dataset is designed for identifying hate speech on social media and consists of 998 comments. The citation is:
   > Ioannis Mollas, Zoe Chrysopoulou, Stamatis Karlos, and Grigorios Tsoumakas. *Ethos: an online hate speech detection dataset*. In Proceedings of the 11th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval-2017), pages 502–518, Vancouver, Canada. Association for Computational Linguistics.

3. **SentNoB Dataset**: This dataset captures sentiment within text, classifying content as positive, negative, or neutral. The citation is:
   > Khondoker Ittehadul Islam, Sudipta Kar, Md Saiful Islam, and Mohammad Ruhul Amin. *SentNoB: A dataset for analysing sentiment on noisy Bangla texts*. In Findings of the Association for Computational Linguistics: EMNLP 2021, pages 3265–3271, Punta Cana, Dominican Republic. Association for Computational Linguistics.

4. **English Sentiment Analysis Dataset**: This dataset consists of tweets annotated for sentiment on various scales. The citation is:
   > Sara Rosenthal, Noura Farra, and Preslav Nakov. *SemEval-2017 task 4: Sentiment analysis in Twitter*. In Proceedings of the 11th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval-2017), pages 502–518, Vancouver, Canada. Association for Computational Linguistics.

5. **XL-Sum Dataset**: This is a large dataset consisting of 1.35 million pairs of articles and their corresponding summaries. The citation is:
   > Md. Arid Hasan, Shudipta Das, Afiyat Anjum, Firoj Alam, Anika Anjum, Avijit Sarker, and Sheak Rashed Haider Noori. *XL-Sum: Large-scale multilingual abstractive summarization for 44 languages*. In Findings of the Association for Computational Linguistics: ACL-IJCNLP 2021, pages 4693–4703, Online. Association for Computational Linguistics.

After identifying these datasets, I will ensure that I have the full citations for each one, as they are crucial for proper referencing in any subsequent work.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that can be used for further analysis or integration into a database, ensuring that all citations are accurately represented.
