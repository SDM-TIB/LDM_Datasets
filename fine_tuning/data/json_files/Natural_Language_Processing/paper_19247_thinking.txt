To extract datasets from the research paper titled "What Do Dialect Speakers Want? A Survey of Attitudes Towards Language Technology for German Dialects" by Verena Blaschke et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, results, and discussion sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or data sources used in the research.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the context of their research and may reference existing datasets or studies that have been conducted in the field of dialects and language technology. I will take note of any datasets that are cited or described.

Next, I will examine the **methodology section** to see if the authors detail the data collection process. This section often includes information about the survey conducted, including the number of participants and the types of data collected. If the authors mention any specific datasets used for comparison or analysis, I will document those.

In the **results section**, I will look for any references to datasets that were analyzed or compared as part of the study. The authors may present findings based on specific datasets, which will be crucial for my extraction.

Finally, I will check the **discussion and conclusion sections** for any reflections on the datasets used, their significance, and how they relate to the findings of the study. This may also include references to other relevant datasets in the field.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This is critical for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets themselves.

For example, if the authors mention a dataset like the "German Dialect Corpus," I will look for the full citation in the references, which might look something like this:
> MÃ¼ller, A., & Schmidt, B. (2020). *The German Dialect Corpus: A Resource for Linguistic Research*. Journal of Linguistic Resources, 15(2), 123-145.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation.

This structured approach will help ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets referenced in the research paper.
