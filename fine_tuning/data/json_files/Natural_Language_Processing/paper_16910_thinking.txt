To extract datasets from the research paper titled "FM-G-CAM: A Holistic Approach for Explainable AI in Computer Vision" by Ravidu Suien Rammuni Silva and Jordan J. Bird, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the development of a new methodology for explainable AI in computer vision, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any references to datasets used in the experiments. The introduction emphasizes the importance of explainability in AI but does not provide specific dataset names.

I will then focus on the **methodology and experiments sections**. In these sections, the authors describe their approach and provide practical use cases. They mention using **open-source, state-of-the-art models and datasets for the prediction tasks**, but I need to find specific dataset names.

In the **use cases section**, the authors refer to the application of their method in image classification and medical AI, specifically mentioning the use of **Chest X-ray images**. They reference **TorchXRayVision** for the DenseNet model, which indicates that this dataset is relevant for their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The relevant citations are:

1. **ImageNet**: 
   > Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, and Li Fei-Fei. *Imagenet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In 2009 IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pages 248–255. IEEE, 2009.

2. **Chest X-ray dataset (CheXpert)**:
   > Jeremy Irvin, Pranav Rajpurkar, Michael Ko, Yifan Yu, Silviana Ciurea-Ilcus, Chris Chute, Henrik Marklund, Behzad Haghgoo, Robyn Ball, Katie Shpanskaya, et al. *Chexpert: A large chest radiograph dataset with uncertainty labels and expert comparison*. In Proceedings of the AAAI conference on artificial intelligence, volume 33, pages 590–597, 2019.

3. **TorchXRayVision**:
   > Joseph Paul Cohen, Joseph D Viviano, Paul Bertin, Paul Morrison, Parsa Torabian, Matteo Guarrera, Matthew P Lungren, Akshay Chaudhari, Rupert Brooks, Mohammad Hashir, et al. *Torchxrayvision: A library of chest x-ray datasets and models*. In International Conference on Medical Imaging with Deep Learning, pages 231–249. PMLR, 2022.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names and their full citations, ensuring that I accurately represent the datasets used in the research.
