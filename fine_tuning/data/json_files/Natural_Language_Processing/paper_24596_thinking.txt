To extract datasets from the research paper titled "STBench: Assessing the Ability of Large Language Models in Spatio-Temporal Analysis" by Wenbin Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the datasets discussed. The abstract mentions the creation of a benchmark dataset called **STBench**, which contains 13 distinct tasks and over 60,000 QA pairs. This indicates that STBench is a primary dataset of interest.

Next, I will look for specific sections that detail the datasets used in the experiments. The **experiments section** is likely to provide insights into the datasets utilized for evaluation. I will also check the **related work** section for any references to other datasets that may have been used in conjunction with STBench.

In the **methodology** section, the authors describe the construction of STBench and the tasks it encompasses. They mention that the dataset is curated from several open-source datasets, including:

1. **Yelp Dataset**: Used for tasks related to Points of Interest (POIs).
2. **New Orleans Region Dataset**: Used for urban region function recognition tasks.
3. **Xi’an Dataset**: Used for trajectory-related tasks.
4. **EULUC Dataset**: Also used for point-region relationship detection tasks.
5. **Geolife Dataset**: Used for trajectory classification and prediction tasks.

I will now compile the full citations for these datasets from the **References section** of the paper:

- For the **Yelp Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yelp Inc. *Yelp Dataset Challenge*. Available at: https://www.yelp.com/dataset.

- For the **New Orleans Region Dataset**, the citation is:
  > United States Government. *New Orleans Region Dataset*. Available at: https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/zoning-district-9939c.

- For the **Xi’an Dataset**, the citation is:
  > DiDi Chuxing Inc. *Xi’an Dataset*. Available at: https://gaia.didichuxing.com/.

- For the **EULUC Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Peng Gong et al. *Mapping Essential Urban Land Use Categories in China (EULUC-China): Preliminary Results for 2018*. Science Bulletin, 65(3):182–187, 2020.

- For the **Geolife Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Microsoft Research. *Geolife GPS Trajectory Dataset: User Guide*. Available at: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/geolife-gps-trajectory-dataset-user-guide/.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets in a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly identified along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets referenced in the paper, which is essential for reproducibility and further research.
