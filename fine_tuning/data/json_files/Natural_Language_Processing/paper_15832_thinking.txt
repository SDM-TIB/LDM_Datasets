To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Geometry-Calibrated DRO: Combating Over-Pessimism with Free Energy Implications" by Jiashuo Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. I will look for any specific names of datasets, descriptions of their contents, and any relevant details such as the number of samples or the nature of the data.

In this paper, the authors mention using **simulation data** and **real-world datasets**. I will note the specific datasets they refer to:

1. **Bike-sharing dataset**: This dataset contains daily counts of rental bikes in a bike-sharing system along with weather and seasonal covariates. The task is to predict the count of rental bikes for casual users.

2. **House Price dataset**: This dataset includes house sales prices from King County, USA, with various predictive covariates such as the number of bedrooms and square footage. The task is to predict house transaction prices.

3. **Temperature dataset**: This dataset consists of temperature forecast data and geographic variables, used to predict the next day's maximum air temperatures.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. 

For the datasets mentioned, I will compile the following citations:

- **Bike-sharing dataset**: 
  > D. Dua and C. Graff. UCI Machine Learning Repository, 2017. URL: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml.

- **House Price dataset**: 
  > Kaggle. House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques. URL: https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data.

- **Temperature dataset**: 
  > D. Dua and C. Graff. UCI Machine Learning Repository, 2017. URL: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml.

Now, I will summarize the datasets and their citations in a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
