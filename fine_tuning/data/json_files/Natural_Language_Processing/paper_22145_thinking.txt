To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DFKI-NLP at SemEval-2024 Task 2: Towards Robust LLMs Using Data Perturbations and MinMax Training" by Bhuvanesh Verma et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections that discuss the datasets**. The abstract mentions the NLI4CT task and the use of large language models (LLMs) for Natural Language Inference on Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs), indicating that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 2.1 (Task and Dataset Description)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the NLI4CT dataset. This section states that the dataset consists of 999 Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and describes the structure of the reports, including sections like Eligibility Criteria, Intervention, Results, and Adverse Events. It also mentions the types of training instances (single and comparison) and their labeling (entailment or contradiction).

I will also check **section 4.1 (Data Perturbation)**, which discusses the use of the NLI4CT dataset and the introduction of perturbations to enhance the dataset. This confirms that the NLI4CT dataset is central to the experiments conducted in the paper.

Now, I will look for the full citation of the NLI4CT dataset in the **References section**. The citation is as follows:
> Maël Jullien, Marco Valentino, and André Freitas. *NLI4CT: Multi-evidence natural language inference for clinical trial reports*. In Proceedings of the 2023 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 16745–16764, Singapore. Association for Computational Linguistics.

Since the paper primarily discusses the NLI4CT dataset, I will focus on this dataset for extraction.

Finally, I will compile the extracted dataset information, ensuring to include the full citation for the NLI4CT dataset, which is crucial for proper attribution and reference.

In summary, the key steps are:
1. Read the abstract and introduction for initial context.
2. Identify and extract details from section 2.1 regarding the NLI4CT dataset.
3. Confirm the dataset's relevance in section 4.1.
4. Retrieve the full citation from the References section.
5. Compile the dataset information for output.

This structured approach ensures that I accurately capture the necessary details about the dataset while adhering to citation requirements.
