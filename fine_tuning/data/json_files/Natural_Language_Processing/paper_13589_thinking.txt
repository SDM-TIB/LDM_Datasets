To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Traffic Light Recognition using Convolutional Neural Networks: A Survey" by Svetlana Pavlitska et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** to get an overview of the paper's focus on traffic light recognition and the importance of datasets in this context. The introduction mentions that the paper reviews existing CNN-based approaches for traffic light detection and classification, which suggests that multiple datasets will be discussed.

Next, I will focus on **section II (Datasets for Traffic Light Recognition)**, where the authors provide a detailed overview of publicly available datasets. This section is likely to contain the most relevant information about the datasets used in the field of traffic light recognition.

In this section, the authors mention several datasets, including:

1. **La Route AutomatisÃ©e (LaRa) dataset**: This dataset was published in 2015 and contains over 11,000 images with 9,000 annotations. It is recorded as a 25 Hz video during a ride in Paris, with images annotated as bounding boxes and traffic light states labeled.

2. **LISA Traffic Light Dataset**: This dataset includes over 40,000 images captured at a 10 Hz video rate, with annotations provided as pixel-level binary masks and bounding boxes. It covers various cities in the USA and includes multiple traffic light states.

3. **Bosch Small Traffic Lights Dataset (BSTLD)**: Recorded in California, this dataset includes disparity maps and annotations for 15 classes describing traffic light colors and pictograms.

4. **DriveU Traffic Light Dataset (DTLD) v1.0 and v2.0**: The v1.0 dataset was published in 2016 and contains a large number of images and annotations. The v2.0 dataset, released in 2021, extends the v1.0 dataset with more diverse traffic scenarios.

5. **Cityscapes TL++ dataset**: This dataset contains images with fine annotations from the Cityscapes dataset, including additional traffic light labels.

6. **WPI Dataset**: Mentioned as another dataset used in the context of traffic light recognition.

After identifying these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access the datasets.

The citations I will extract include:

- For the **LaRa dataset**:
  > Robotics Centre of Mines ParisTech. *Traffic lights recognition (TLR) public benchmarks*, 2015.

- For the **LISA Traffic Light Dataset**:
  > M. B. Jensen et al. *Vision for looking at traffic lights: Issues, survey, and perspectives*. IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems, 2016.

- For the **BSTLD**:
  > K. Behrendt et al. *A deep learning approach to traffic lights: Detection, tracking, and classification*. In International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA), IEEE, 2017.

- For the **DriveU Traffic Light Dataset**:
  > A. Fregin et al. *The DriveU Traffic Light Dataset: Introduction and comparison with existing datasets*. In International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA), IEEE, 2018.

- For the **Cityscapes TL++ dataset**:
  > J. Janosovits. *Cityscapes TL++: Semantic traffic light annotations for the Cityscapes dataset*. In International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA), IEEE, 2022.

- For the **WPI Dataset**:
  > Z. Chen and X. Huang. *Accurate and reliable detection of traffic lights using multiclass learning and multiobject tracking*. IEEE Intelligent Transportation Systems Magazine, 2016.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured all relevant details regarding the datasets discussed in the paper.
