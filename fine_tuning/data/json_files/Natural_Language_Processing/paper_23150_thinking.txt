To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CiliaGraph: Enabling Expression-enhanced Hyper-Dimensional Computation in Ultra-Lightweight and One-Shot Graph Classification on Edge" by Yuxi Han et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research but may not specify datasets. The introduction often discusses related work and may reference datasets used in prior studies.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experiments)**, as this section typically contains detailed information about the datasets used for validation. In this paper, the authors mention that they conducted experiments on **seven real-world datasets selected from Tudataset**. This indicates that there are specific datasets that I need to identify.

I will look for a subsection within section 5 that lists these datasets. Upon reviewing the text, I find that the datasets mentioned include:

1. **PROTEINS_full**: A dataset used for graph classification tasks.
2. **COIL-RAG**: Another dataset utilized in the experiments.
3. **Synthie**: A synthetic dataset included for testing.
4. **Letter-low**: A dataset used for classification tasks.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The paper cites the Tudataset as the source for these datasets, which is crucial for providing proper attribution.

The citation for the Tudataset is:
> Christopher Morris, Nils M Kriege, Franka Bause, Kristian Kersting, Petra Mutzel, and Marion Neumann. *Tudataset: A collection of benchmark datasets for learning with graphs*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2007.08663, 2020.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citation for the Tudataset as it encompasses all the datasets mentioned in the paper.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its citation.
