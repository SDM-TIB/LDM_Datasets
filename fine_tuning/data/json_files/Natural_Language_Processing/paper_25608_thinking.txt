To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Improving Context-Aware Preference Modeling for Language Models" by Silviu Pitis et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors contribute context-conditioned preference datasets, which suggests that there are specific datasets to look for.

Next, I will examine **section 4 (Reasonable Preference Reversal (RPR) Datasets)**, where the authors describe their contribution in detail. Here, they mention the creation of two main datasets:

1. **RPR Criteria Dataset**: This dataset consists of over 20,000 paired tuples of prompt, context, and preference judgments, designed to measure context-specific preference. The authors explain that the dataset is generated to ensure that preference prediction performance is determined solely by the model's ability to interpret context.

2. **RPR Scenarios Dataset**: This dataset is synthesized from the RPR Criteria dataset and includes similar paired tuples but focuses on different contextual scenarios. It is also designed to evaluate context-specific preference modeling capabilities.

In the **experiments section**, the authors mention using these datasets to benchmark the performance of various models, which confirms their relevance and application in the study.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper does not provide specific citations for the RPR datasets since they are newly introduced in this work. However, I can note that the datasets are open-sourced and can be accessed through the authors' provided links or repositories.

Since the datasets are original contributions of the authors, I will document them as follows:

- **RPR Criteria Dataset**: A dataset containing over 20,000 paired tuples of prompt, context, and preference judgments, designed for evaluating context-specific preference modeling.

- **RPR Scenarios Dataset**: A dataset derived from the RPR Criteria dataset, focusing on different contextual scenarios to assess preference modeling capabilities.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for clarity and future reference.

In summary, I have identified two main datasets from the paper, both of which are original contributions by the authors and do not have external citations since they are newly created. I will ensure to document their descriptions accurately for any future use.
