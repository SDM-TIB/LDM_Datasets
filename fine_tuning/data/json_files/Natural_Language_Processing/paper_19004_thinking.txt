To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Color Image Denoising Using The Green Channel Prior" by Zhaoming Kong and Xiaowei Yang, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **experiments section**, the authors explicitly mention the datasets they used for their evaluations. I will pay close attention to any tables or figures that summarize the datasets, as they often contain key details.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention several datasets used for their experiments:

1. **SIDD (Smartphone Image Denoising Dataset)**: This dataset is referenced as providing training and validation samples for real-world color image denoising tasks.

2. **DND (Denoising Dataset)**: This dataset is used for evaluating denoising algorithms, but the clean-noisy image pairs are not available, and results are obtained by submitting denoised images.

3. **CC15 (Color Challenge 2015)**: This dataset is also mentioned as a benchmark for evaluating denoising performance.

4. **CC60**: Another dataset referenced for performance evaluation.

5. **PolyU**: This dataset is included in the experiments for denoising tasks.

6. **HighISO**: This dataset is used for testing the proposed method.

7. **IOCI (Image and Optical Character Recognition Dataset)**: This dataset is mentioned for video denoising tasks.

8. **CVRD (Color Video Restoration Dataset)**: This dataset is used for evaluating the performance of the proposed method on video denoising.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

After reviewing the references, I find the following citations:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their full citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
