To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Large Language Models for Scientific Information Extraction: An Empirical Study for Virology" by Mahsa Shamsabadi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the creation of a gold-standard corpus for a complex information extraction task, which suggests that there may be specific datasets referenced.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Corpus)**, where the authors describe their dataset creation process. They mention starting with the **CORD-19 dataset**, which is a large-scale collection of publications related to COVID-19 and other infectious diseases. This dataset is crucial for their research and should be documented.

The authors also describe filtering this dataset to create a curated corpus specifically focused on the R0 estimate theme, resulting in a final dataset of 3024 abstracts. This curated dataset is significant for their study and should be included as well.

I will also check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. The CORD-19 dataset is referenced as follows:
- For the **CORD-19 dataset**, the citation is:
  > Lucy Lu Wang, Kyle Lo, Yoganand Chandrasekhar, Russell Reas, Jiangjiang Yang, Darrin Eide, Kathryn Funk, Rodney Kinney, Ziyang Liu, William Merrill, et al. *CORD-19: The COVID-19 Open Research Dataset*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2004.10706, 2020.

Additionally, the authors mention that their curated corpus is a gold-standard dataset for training and development purposes, but they do not provide a specific citation for it. However, I will note that it is derived from the CORD-19 dataset.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for the datasets identified. The entries will include the CORD-19 dataset and the curated corpus derived from it.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited.
