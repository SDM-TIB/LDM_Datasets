To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Language-Driven Interactive Traffic Trajectory Generation" by Junkai Xia et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on the **Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD)** and **nuPlan**, indicating that these are the datasets used for their evaluations.

Next, I will look for specific details about these datasets in the **experiments section**. The authors state that they used the **Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD)** and **nuPlan** for their experiments, confirming their relevance. I will also check if there are any additional details provided about these datasets, such as their characteristics or the context in which they were used.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide a brief description of the datasets:
- **Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD)**: This dataset is referenced as a benchmark for motion forecasting in autonomous driving scenarios.
- **nuPlan**: This dataset is also mentioned as a source of real-world vehicle trajectories and corresponding lane maps.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access the datasets.

The citations I will extract are:
- For **Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD)**, the citation is:
  > Kan Chen, Runzhou Ge, Hang Qiu, Rami Ai-Rfou, Charles R. Qi, Xuanyu Zhou, Zoey Yang, Scott Ettinger, Pei Sun, Zhaoqi Leng, Mustafa Mustafa, Ivan Bogun, Weiyue Wang, Mingxing Tan, and Dragomir Anguelov. *Large scale interactive motion forecasting for autonomous driving: The Waymo Open Motion Dataset*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 9710â€“9719, October 2021.

- For **nuPlan**, the citation is:
  > K. Tan et al. H. Caesar, J. Kabzan. *NuPlan: A closed-loop ML-based planning benchmark for autonomous vehicles*. In CVPR ADP3 workshop, 2021.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
