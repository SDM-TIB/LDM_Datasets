To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Use of Boosting Algorithms in Household-Level Poverty Measurement: A Machine Learning Approach to Predict and Classify Household Wealth Quintiles in the Philippines" by Erika Lynet V. Salvador, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on machine learning models for predicting poverty levels, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets.

Next, I will examine **section 2 (Data and Methods)**, where the author discusses the data cleaning and preparation process. Here, the author states that the data was obtained from the **2022 Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) in the Philippines**. This is a crucial dataset for the study, and I will need to gather more details about it.

In this section, the author mentions that the original dataset consisted of **30,372 households** and **2,099 features**, which were reduced to **396 features** after cleaning. This indicates the dataset's size and complexity, which is relevant for understanding its application in the study.

Now, I will look for the **full citation** of the dataset in the **References section**. The DHS data is a well-known dataset, and I will ensure to provide the correct citation for it. The citation for the DHS data is typically as follows:

> Philippines Department of Health. *Philippines Demographic and Health Survey 2022*. Retrieved from [https://dhsprogram.com](https://dhsprogram.com).

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets, I will conclude that the **2022 DHS dataset** is the primary dataset used in this research.

Finally, I will compile the information about the dataset, including its name, description, and citation, into a structured format for clarity and future reference. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the relevant dataset information from the paper.
