To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Reinforcement Learning for Adaptive MCMC" by Congye Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and empirical assessment sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the methodology was validated on the **PosteriorDB benchmark**, indicating that this is a dataset of interest.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any additional datasets that may be referenced. The introduction discusses the relationship between adaptive MCMC and reinforcement learning but does not explicitly mention other datasets.

In the **methods section**, I will look for any specific datasets used in the experiments. The authors describe their methodology and mention the **PosteriorDB benchmark** again, confirming its significance in their evaluation.

Moving to the **empirical assessment section**, I will find detailed information about the **PosteriorDB** dataset. The authors state that PosteriorDB consists of a collection of posteriors for Bayesian inference and that it includes 120 models, with a subset of 44 models compatible with their implementation.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the PosteriorDB dataset. The relevant citation is:
> Magnusson, M., BÃ¼rkner, P., & Vehtari, A. (2022). PosteriorDB: A set of posteriors for Bayesian inference and probabilistic programming. URL: https://github.com/stan-dev/posteriordb.

Since the paper primarily discusses the PosteriorDB benchmark and does not mention any other datasets, I will conclude my extraction here.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry for the PosteriorDB into a structured format, ensuring that the full citation is included for clarity and proper attribution.
