To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multimodality in Online Education: A Comparative Study" by Praneeta Immadisetty et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections that discuss datasets** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract highlights the need for a multimodal approach to affect recognition in online education, which suggests that datasets related to this topic may be included.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Datasets Available)**, which is likely to contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the study. This section outlines various datasets for different recognition tasks, including gesture and posture recognition, eye tracking, facial recognition, and speech or verbal recognition.

In this section, I find the following datasets:

1. **Custom Dataset for Gesture and Posture Recognition**: This dataset consists of around 4000 images categorized into three types: slouching, writing, and sitting upright. It is specifically created for the study due to the lack of publicly available datasets in this area.

2. **Labelled Pupils in the Wild (LPW)**: This dataset includes 66 videos consisting of 130,856 separate frames, used for eye tracking recognition.

3. **GazeCapture**: A dataset created by MIT for eye tracking, which is also mentioned in the context of eye tracking recognition.

4. **FER2013**: This dataset contains over 35,000 grayscale images of various facial expressions, classified into seven commonly identified emotions, which are utilized for facial recognition.

5. **RAVDESS (Ryerson Audio-Visual Database of Emotional Speech and Song)**: This dataset consists of 7356 audio-only files used for speech recognition, capturing various emotional tones.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to guide readers to the original sources.

- For the **Custom Dataset for Gesture and Posture Recognition**, since it is created by the authors, I will note it as:
  > Immadisetty, P., Rajesh, P., Gupta, A., M R, A., A, S., & Subramanya, K. N. (2023). *Custom Dataset for Gesture and Posture Recognition*. Unpublished dataset.

- For **Labelled Pupils in the Wild (LPW)**, the citation is:
  > Tonsen, M., Zhang, X., Sugano, Y., & Bulling, A. (2016). *Labelled Pupils in the Wild*. In Proceedings of the Ninth Biennial ACM Symposium on Eye Tracking Research and Applications. doi:10.1145/2857491.2857520.

- For **GazeCapture**, the citation is:

- For **FER2013**, the citation is:
  > Goodfellow, I. J., Erhan, D., Carrier, P. L., Courville, A., Mirza, M., & Bengio, Y. (2013). *Challenges in Representation Learning: A Report on Three Machine Learning Contests*. In Neural Information Processing (pp. 117-124). Springer. doi:10.1007/978-3-642-42051-1_10.

- For **RAVDESS**, the citation is:
  > Livingstone, S., & Russo, F. (2018). *The Ryerson Audio-Visual Database of Emotional Speech and Song (RAVDESS): A Dynamic, Multimodal Set of Facial and Vocal Expressions in North American English*. PLOS ONE, 13(5), e0196391. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0196391.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries with their full citations for clarity and completeness. This structured approach ensures that I accurately capture all relevant datasets and their sources from the paper.
