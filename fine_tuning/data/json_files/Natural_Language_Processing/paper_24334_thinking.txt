To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Domain Adaptation of Llama3-70B-Instruct through Continual Pre-Training and Model Merging: A Comprehensive Evaluation" by Shamane Siriwardhana et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on SEC data, which suggests that this is a dataset of interest.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **data acquisition and pre-processing** section. Here, the authors describe their process for reading and extracting text data from SEC filings. They mention using libraries to handle SEC data, which confirms that SEC data is indeed a dataset used in their experiments.

In the **evaluation** section, the authors discuss their model's performance on various benchmarks, but they do not introduce new datasets here. Instead, they refer to the SEC data as the primary dataset for their continual pre-training.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the SEC dataset. The SEC data is not attributed to a specific paper but is a collection of filings from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Therefore, I will provide a general citation for the SEC data:

- **SEC Data**: U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. *SEC Filings*. Available at: https://www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/companysearch.html. Accessed: [insert access date].

Additionally, I will note that the authors also mention using a general sample of Together AIâ€™s RedPijama data, which is another dataset involved in their training process. I will look for its citation as well.

For the **RedPijama dataset**, I will refer to the following citation:

- **RedPijama Dataset**: Together AI. *RedPijama Dataset*. Available at: https://huggingface.co/datasets/togetherai/redpijama. Accessed: [insert access date].

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for both the SEC data and the RedPijama dataset. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
