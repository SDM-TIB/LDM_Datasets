To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Entropic Open-set Active Learning" by Bardia Safaei et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the proposed method is evaluated on **CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and TinyImageNet datasets**. This indicates that these datasets are likely to be important for the experiments conducted in the paper.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** to confirm the use of these datasets and gather more details about them. The authors explicitly state that they perform extensive experiments on **CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and TinyImageNet**, providing a brief description of each dataset's characteristics, such as the number of images and categories.

In the **experiments section**, I find the following details:

1. **CIFAR-10**: Contains 50,000 training images and 10,000 testing images across 10 categories.
2. **CIFAR-100**: Similar to CIFAR-10, but contains 50,000 training images and 10,000 testing images across 100 categories.
3. **TinyImageNet**: A larger dataset with 100,000 training images and 20,000 testing images across 200 categories.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **CIFAR-10** and **CIFAR-100**, the citation is:
  > Krizhevsky, A., Hinton, G., et al. (2009). *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. Technical Report TR-2009, University of Toronto.

- For **TinyImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Yao, L., & Miller, J. (2015). *Tiny ImageNet classification with convolutional neural networks*. CS 231N, 2(5): 8.

With this information gathered, I will now compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes the full citation as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
