To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Driving Towards Inclusion: Revisiting In-Vehicle Interaction in Autonomous Vehicles" by Ashish Bastola et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a summary of the paper's focus on inclusive HCI in autonomous vehicles, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets.

Next, I will examine the **methodology section**, particularly the parts that discuss the systematic review process. Here, the authors describe their search strategy and the number of articles identified from various databases. However, they do not specify any datasets used in their analysis or review.

I will also check the **results and discussion sections** to see if any datasets are referenced in the context of user needs or preferences regarding autonomous vehicles. The authors discuss various user needs and preferences but do not cite specific datasets.

Finally, I will look at the **references section** to see if any datasets are cited in the context of previous studies or literature that informed their research. However, the references primarily consist of studies and articles rather than datasets.

Since the paper does not explicitly mention any datasets, I will conclude that there are no datasets to extract from this particular research paper. Therefore, I will not be able to provide full citations for datasets as none are identified in the text.

In summary, my approach involved reviewing multiple sections of the paper to identify any datasets, but ultimately, it appears that this paper does not include any specific datasets for citation.
