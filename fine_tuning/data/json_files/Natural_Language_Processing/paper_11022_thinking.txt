To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Graph Switching Dynamical Systems" by Yongtuo Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors introduce two new datasets for benchmarking interacting object systems, which is a strong indication that I will need to extract details about these datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any relevant sections that describe the datasets in detail. In this paper, the authors mention two datasets: 

1. **Synthesized ODE-driven Particle Dataset**: This dataset is generated using three Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) systems (Lotka-Volterra, Spiral, and Bouncing Ball) to create time-evolving trajectories of particles. The paper describes how the dataset is structured and the number of samples used for training and testing.

2. **Salsa Couple Dancing Dataset**: This dataset consists of 17 real-world Salsa dancing videos, containing 8,672 frames. The authors explain how they extracted 3D skeletons from the videos and annotated the modes of movement for the dancers.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations I will extract are:

- For the **Synthesized ODE-driven Particle Dataset**, the citation is not explicitly provided in the references, but I can summarize the dataset's creation based on the methods described in the paper.

- For the **Salsa Couple Dancing Dataset**, the citation is based on the original work by Dong et al. (2020), which the authors reference. The citation for this dataset is:
  > Dong, Z., Seybold, B., Murphy, K., and Bui, H. *Collapsed amortized variational inference for switching nonlinear dynamical systems*. In International Conference on Machine Learning, pp. 2638â€“2647, 2020.

Now, I will compile the information about each dataset, including their descriptions and citations, ensuring that I maintain clarity and accuracy in the details provided. This structured approach will help in creating a comprehensive summary of the datasets used in the research paper.
