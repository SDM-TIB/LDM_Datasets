To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Stone Needle: A General Multimodal Large-scale Model Framework towards Healthcare" by Weihua Liu and Yong Zuo, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the framework integrates various modalities, which suggests that datasets may be involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the need for multimodal data in healthcare, but I need to look for specific datasets mentioned in the experimental setup.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiment)**, where the authors describe their experimental setup. They mention using a multimodal dataset comprising anonymized patient records, which includes:

- **865,275 text entries**
- **428,391 images**
- **421,785 videos**
- **463,814 audio files**

This dataset is used for training, while a smaller evaluation set includes **1,000 text entries, 1,000 images, 1,000 videos, and 1,000 audio files**. 

The authors do not provide a specific name for this dataset, but they describe it as a multimodal dataset of anonymized patient records. Since it is not a standard dataset with a widely recognized citation, I will note it as an internal dataset used for their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to see if there are any citations related to the datasets mentioned. However, it appears that the paper does not cite any external datasets, as the focus is on the internal dataset they created for their study.

Since the dataset is not publicly available or named, I will summarize the information as follows:

1. **Multimodal Patient Records Dataset**: This dataset consists of various modalities, including text, images, videos, and audio, specifically designed for training and evaluating the Stone Needle framework.

Now, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the details I have gathered, even though the citation is not from an external source. The dataset entry will reflect the nature of the dataset and its purpose in the research.

After completing this process, I will have a clear and concise entry for the dataset used in the paper, ready for further processing or review.
