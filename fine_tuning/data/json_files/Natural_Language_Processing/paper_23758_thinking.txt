To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Guiding Catalogue Enrichment with User Queries" by Yupei Du et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors assess their method on two popular encyclopedia KGs, specifically **DBPedia** and **YAGO 4**. This suggests that these are the datasets of interest.

Next, I will look for explicit mentions of these datasets in the **experiments section**. In the introduction, the authors mention using **DBPedia** and **YAGO 4** for their experiments, which confirms their relevance. I will also check the **evaluation section** to see if there are any additional details or datasets mentioned.

In the **experimental setup section**, the authors specify that they use **DBPedia** (specifically the English Wikipedia InfoBox from July 2020) and **YAGO 4** (from February 2020) for their experiments. This provides clarity on the specific versions of the datasets used.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the **References section** of the paper:

1. **DBPedia**:
   > Lehmann, J., Isele, R., Jakob, M., Jentzsch, A., Kontokostas, D., Mendes, P.N., Hellmann, S., Morsey, M., Van Kleef, P., Auer, S., et al. *DBpedia – A large-scale, multilingual knowledge base extracted from Wikipedia*. Semantic Web, 6(2), 167–195, 2015.

2. **YAGO 4**:
   > Pellissier Tanon, T., Weikum, G., Suchanek, F.M. *YAGO 4: A reason-able knowledge base*. In: The Semantic Web - 17th International Conference, ESWC 2020, Heraklion, Crete, Greece, May 31-June 4, 2020, Proceedings. Lecture Notes in Computer Science, vol. 12123, pp. 583–596. Springer, 2020.

After collecting this information, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

- **DBPedia**: A large-scale, multilingual knowledge base extracted from Wikipedia, used for various knowledge graph tasks.
- **YAGO 4**: A knowledge base that integrates information from Wikipedia and WordNet, providing structured data for semantic web applications.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that each dataset is accompanied by its full citation.
