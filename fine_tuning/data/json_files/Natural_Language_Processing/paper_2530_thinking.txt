To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Low-rank Convex/Sparse Thermal Matrix Approximation for Infrared-based Diagnostic System" by Bardia Yousefi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, results, and conclusion sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the use of "active and passive thermographic imaging systems" and "the Database for Mastology Research (DMR) dataset," which indicates that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, where the authors describe their experimental setup. They mention using three diverse specimens for active thermography: **carbon fiber-reinforced polymer composites (CFRP)**, **poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA, also known as Plexiglas)**, and **aluminum plate**. However, these are not datasets but rather materials used in the experiments.

In the **results section**, the authors provide details about the **Infrared breast cancer dataset**, which consists of 55 participants selected from the DMR dataset. This dataset is crucial for the study, as it is used for breast screening analysis.

I will now check the **references section** to find the full citation for the DMR dataset. The paper does not provide a specific citation for the DMR dataset, but it does mention that the dataset includes clinical information and demographics of the participants. I will note that the authors refer to the DMR dataset but do not provide a formal citation in the references.

The relevant datasets identified are:

1. **Database for Mastology Research (DMR)**: This dataset includes 55 participants with various health statuses (healthy and symptomatic) and is used for infrared breast screening.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring to include the full citation for the DMR dataset as it is critical for proper attribution. Since the paper does not provide a specific citation for the DMR dataset, I will note that it is referenced in the context of the study but lacks a formal citation.

In summary, the datasets extracted from the paper are:

- **Database for Mastology Research (DMR)**: This dataset is used for breast cancer screening and includes clinical information about the participants.

I will ensure to document this information clearly, emphasizing the importance of citing datasets accurately in future references.
