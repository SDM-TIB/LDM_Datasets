To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Sample Design Engineering: An Empirical Study of What Makes Good Downstream Fine-Tuning Samples for LLMs" by Biyang Guo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the research, which may include references to datasets.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of sample design for fine-tuning LLMs and mention conducting experiments on various tasks. However, they do not explicitly name any datasets here, so I will need to look further.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**. In **section 4.1**, the authors specify the tasks and datasets used for their evaluations. They mention two specific datasets:

1. **GENIA Dataset**: This dataset is used for nested named entity recognition (NER) tasks in the molecular biology domain. The authors reference the original paper for this dataset.
   
2. **MAVEN Dataset**: This dataset is used for event detection tasks. The authors also provide a reference for this dataset.

I will now check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **GENIA Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Ohta, T., Tateisi, Y., Kim, J.-D., Mima, H., & Tsujii, J. (2002). The GENIA corpus: An annotated research abstract corpus in molecular biology domain. In Proceedings of the Human Language Technology Conference, pages 73–77. Citeseer.

- For the **MAVEN Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Wang, X., Jiang, Y., Han, S., & Zhou, J. (2020). MAVEN: A massive general domain event detection dataset. In Proceedings of the 2020 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), pages 1652–1671.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and future reference.

In summary, the datasets extracted from the paper are:

1. **GENIA Dataset**
   - Citation: Ohta, T., Tateisi, Y., Kim, J.-D., Mima, H., & Tsujii, J. (2002). The GENIA corpus: An annotated research abstract corpus in molecular biology domain. In Proceedings of the Human Language Technology Conference, pages 73–77. Citeseer.

2. **MAVEN Dataset**
   - Citation: Wang, X., Jiang, Y., Han, S., & Zhou, J. (2020). MAVEN: A massive general domain event detection dataset. In Proceedings of the 2020 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), pages 1652–1671.

With this information, I am ready to present the dataset entries in the required format for further processing or review.
