To extract datasets from the research paper titled "D-NLP at SemEval-2024 Task 2: Evaluating Clinical Inference Capabilities of Large Language Models" by Duygu Altinok, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate LLMs using clinical trial reports as the dataset, which suggests that there is a specific dataset involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Task and Dataset Description)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset used for their experiments. Here, they mention that the dataset consists of clinical trials sourced from ClinicalTrials.gov, specifically focusing on breast cancer trials. They state that the dataset includes a total of 1,000 trials written in English, which is a significant detail.

The authors further describe the dataset's structure, including various fields such as **Eligibility Criteria, Intervention, Results, and Adverse Events**. They also mention that the dataset comprises 7,400 statements divided into training, development, and hidden test datasets. This section provides a comprehensive overview of the dataset's characteristics.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The dataset is derived from ClinicalTrials.gov, which is a well-known database, but I need to ensure I provide the correct citation format.

The citation for the dataset is:
> ClinicalTrials.gov. U.S. National Library of Medicine. Available at: https://clinicaltrials.gov.

Since the dataset is based on publicly available clinical trial data, I will note that the citation reflects the source of the dataset rather than a traditional academic paper.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the dataset details, including its name, description, and citation, ensuring that I adhere to the importance of providing full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for clarity and future reference.
