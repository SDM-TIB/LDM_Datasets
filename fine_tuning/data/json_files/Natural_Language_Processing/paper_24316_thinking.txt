To extract datasets from the research paper titled "EAGER: Two-Stream Generative Recommender with Behavior-Semantic Collaboration" by Jiahao Xun et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors validate their method on "four public benchmarks," which indicates that datasets are involved. I will look for specific names of these datasets.

Next, I will examine **section 4 (Experiments)**, particularly **subsection 4.1 (Experimental Setting)**, where the authors discuss the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they explicitly list the datasets:

1. **Amazon Product Reviews**: The authors mention using three categories from this dataset: Beauty, Sports and Outdoors, and Toys and Games. This indicates that there are multiple datasets derived from a single source.

2. **Yelp 2019**: The authors specify that they use the Yelp Challenge dataset, focusing on transaction records from small businesses.

Now, I will gather detailed statistics about each dataset from **Table 1**, which provides information on the number of users, items, interactions, and density for each dataset. This will help in describing the datasets comprehensively.

Next, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution. Based on the information provided in the paper, I can derive the following citations:

- For the **Amazon Product Reviews dataset**, the citation is:
  > Julian McAuley, Christopher Targett, Qinfeng Shi, and Anton Van Den Hengel. *Image-based recommendations on styles and substitutes*. In Proceedings of the 38th international ACM SIGIR conference on research and development in information retrieval, pages 43â€“52, 2015.

- For the **Yelp 2019 dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yelp Inc. *Yelp Dataset Challenge*. Available at: https://www.yelp.com/dataset.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly describes each dataset, ensuring that the full citations are included for proper referencing. This will facilitate further analysis or use of the datasets in future research.
