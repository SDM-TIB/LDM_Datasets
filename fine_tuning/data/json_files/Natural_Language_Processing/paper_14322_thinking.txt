To extract datasets from the research paper titled "BEVHeight++: Toward Robust Visual Centric 3D Object Detection" by Lei Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their method on "popular 3D detection benchmarks of roadside cameras," which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section** where the authors refer to "two large-scale benchmark datasets" for roadside cameras. This indicates that specific datasets will be mentioned later in the paper.

I will then look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors explicitly mention two datasets:

1. **DAIR-V2X**: This dataset is introduced by Yu et al. (2022) and is described as a large-scale, multi-modality dataset that contains images from vehicles and roadside units. The specific subset used in the experiments is DAIR-V2X-I, which focuses on images from mounted cameras.

2. **Rope3D**: This dataset is introduced by Ye et al. (2022) and contains over 500k images with three-dimensional bounding boxes from various intersections, which is utilized for the 3D object detection task.

To confirm the details and obtain the full citations for these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper:

- For **DAIR-V2X**, the citation is:
  > H. Yu, Y. Luo, M. Shu, Y. Huo, Z. Yang, Y. Shi, Z. Guo, H. Li, X. Hu, J. Yuan et al. "DAIR-V2X: A large-scale dataset for vehicle-infrastructure cooperative 3D object detection." In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2022, pp. 21 361–21 370.

- For **Rope3D**, the citation is:
  > X. Ye, M. Shu, H. Li, Y. Shi, Y. Li, G. Wang, X. Tan, and E. Ding. "Rope3D: The roadside perception dataset for autonomous driving and monocular 3D object detection task." In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2022, pp. 21 341–21 350.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
