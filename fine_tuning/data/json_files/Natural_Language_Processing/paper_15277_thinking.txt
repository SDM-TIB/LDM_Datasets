To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Distributed MIMO for 6G sub-Networks in the Unlicensed Spectrum" by Mohamed Elwekeil et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on distributed MIMO and its implications for 6G sub-networks, but it does not mention specific datasets.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section closely. Here, the authors discuss the context of 6G networks and the challenges associated with unlicensed spectrum usage. While they reference previous works, they do not specify any datasets at this point.

Moving on to the **methodology and numerical results sections**, I will look for any mention of datasets used for simulations or experiments. The paper describes a simulation environment and various parameters but does not explicitly mention any datasets.

I will also check the **numerical results** section, where the authors present their findings based on simulations. They describe the scenarios and parameters used in their experiments, but again, there is no mention of specific datasets.

Finally, I will review the **references section** to see if any cited works include datasets. The references primarily consist of previous research articles and standards related to 6G and MIMO technologies, but they do not provide specific datasets.

After thoroughly reviewing the paper, it appears that there are no explicit datasets mentioned or utilized in the research. The authors focus on theoretical modeling and simulations rather than empirical data derived from specific datasets.

Since no datasets were identified in the paper, I will not be able to provide full citations for any datasets. However, I will summarize the findings and note that the research relies on simulations rather than external datasets.

In conclusion, I will document that the paper does not reference any datasets, and therefore, there are no citations to provide. This will be important for future reference or for anyone looking to understand the data sources used in this research.
