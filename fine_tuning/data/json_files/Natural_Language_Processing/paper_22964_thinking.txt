To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Shopping Queries Image Dataset (SQID): An Image-Enriched ESCI Dataset for Exploring Multimodal Learning in Product Search" by Marie Al Ghossein et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract introduces the **Shopping Queries Image Dataset (SQID)**, which is an extension of the Amazon Shopping Queries Dataset enriched with image information. This indicates that there is at least one dataset to extract.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for further details about the dataset. The introduction mentions that SQID includes image information for 190,000 products and facilitates research on multimodal learning techniques. This reinforces the importance of SQID as a dataset.

I will then look into **section 3 (Shopping Queries Image (SQID) Dataset)**, which provides detailed characteristics of SQID. It describes the dataset's contents, including image URLs, visual embeddings, and text embeddings associated with search queries. This section confirms that SQID is the primary dataset discussed in the paper.

Additionally, I will check the **related work** section to see if the authors reference the original **Shopping Queries Dataset (SQD)**, which SQID builds upon. The paper notes that SQD was released by Amazon and includes a large number of product search queries, which is relevant context for understanding SQID.

Now, I will consult the **references section** to gather full citations for both datasets:

1. For the **Shopping Queries Image Dataset (SQID)**, since it is a new dataset introduced in this paper, I will cite it as follows:
   > Marie Al Ghossein, Ching-Wei Chen, and Jason Tang. *Shopping Queries Image Dataset (SQID): An Image-Enriched ESCI Dataset for Exploring Multimodal Learning in Product Search*. In Proceedings of the SIGIR Workshop on eCommerce (eCom), 2024.

2. For the **Shopping Queries Dataset (SQD)**, the citation is:
   > C. K. Reddy, L. MÃ rquez, F. Valero, N. Rao, H. Zaragoza, S. Bandyopadhyay, A. Biswas, A. Xing, K. Subbian. *Shopping Queries Dataset: A Large-Scale ESCI Benchmark for Improving Product Search*. arXiv:2206.06588, 2022.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for both SQID and SQD as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets discussed in the paper, ready for further processing or review.
