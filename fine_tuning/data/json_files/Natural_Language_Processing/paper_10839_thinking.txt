To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Safety of Autonomous Vehicles: A Survey on Model-based vs. AI-based Approaches" by Dimia Iberraken and Lounis Adouane, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a high-level overview, and the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the research, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will look for specific sections that typically contain dataset information, such as **"Datasets," "Experiments," or "Methodology."** In these sections, the authors usually describe the datasets used for their experiments, including their characteristics, size, and any relevant details.

As I read through the paper, I will take note of any datasets mentioned. For example, if the authors refer to a dataset used for training or testing their models, I will record the name of the dataset and any details provided about it.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. I will ensure that I capture the authors, title, publication venue, and year for each dataset.

For instance, if the paper mentions a dataset like the "Bertha-Benz Memorial Route," I will look for its citation in the references. If the citation is not directly provided, I may need to conduct a brief search to find the original source of the dataset.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details and that the datasets are accurately represented.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset information in a clear format for easy reference, making sure that all citations are complete and correctly formatted.
