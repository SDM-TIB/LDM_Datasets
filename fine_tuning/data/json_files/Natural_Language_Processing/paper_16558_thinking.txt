To extract datasets from the research paper titled "TrafficMOT: A Challenging Dataset for Multi-Object Tracking in Complex Traffic Scenarios" by Lihao Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract introduces the TrafficMOT dataset, indicating that it is designed to address the limitations of existing datasets for multi-object tracking in traffic videos. This suggests that TrafficMOT is the primary dataset of interest.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of other datasets in the **introduction** and **subsequent sections**. The introduction discusses the limitations of existing datasets like **VERI-Wild** and **MOTS**, which are relevant to the context of TrafficMOT. I will note these datasets as they may be important for comparison or context.

In the **methodology** section, I will look for any detailed descriptions of the TrafficMOT dataset, including its characteristics, the number of videos, classes, and any specific features that differentiate it from other datasets. The paper states that TrafficMOT consists of 2,102 videos and includes ten classes, which is crucial information for describing the dataset.

I will also check the **experiments** section to see if the authors mention any other datasets used for benchmarking or comparison. The paper references the **UrbanTracker**, **CADP**, and **CityFlow** datasets, which are also relevant to the discussion of TrafficMOT.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. Here are the citations I will extract:

In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pp. 8797–8806.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This will ensure that I have accurately captured all relevant datasets and their full citations from the paper.
