To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Energy Sharing among Resources within Electrical Distribution Systems: A Systematic Review" by G Hari Krishna et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides an overview of the paper's focus on energy-sharing methods and algorithms, which may hint at the datasets used in the analysis.

Next, I will examine the **sections discussing case studies and experiments**. These sections often contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used for analysis. I will look for any tables or figures that summarize datasets, as well as any references to specific datasets in the text.

In the **case studies section**, the authors mention several energy-sharing projects and initiatives. I will compile a list of these projects, noting any datasets associated with them. For example, if a project is mentioned with specific data points or metrics, I will document that as a dataset.

I will also check the **references section** for any cited datasets or studies that may provide additional context or data sources. This is crucial for ensuring that I have the correct citations for each dataset.

Once I have identified the datasets, I will ensure to retrieve the full citations for each one. For instance, if a dataset is derived from a specific project or study, I will include the authors, title, publication venue, and year of publication.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including their descriptions and citations, into a structured format for easy reference. This will ensure that all relevant information is captured and can be utilized for further analysis or review.

By following these steps, I will be able to extract and document the datasets from the paper effectively, ensuring that I maintain the integrity of the citations and provide a comprehensive overview of the data used in the research.
