To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DetZero: Rethinking Offboard 3D Object Detection with Long-term Sequential Point Clouds" by Tao Ma et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are referenced. In the abstract, the authors mention conducting experiments on the **Waymo Open Dataset**, which indicates that this is a key dataset used in their research.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors explicitly mention the **Waymo Open Dataset** in section 4.1, where they provide details about the dataset, including its size and the number of scenes available for training, validation, and testing.

In section 4.1, the authors describe the **Waymo Open Dataset** as follows:
- It contains a total of 1150 LiDAR scenes, with 798 for training, 202 for validation, and 150 for testing. The dataset provides 20-second point cloud data for each scene at a sampling frequency of 10Hz, along with 3D annotations for four object categories.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the **Waymo Open Dataset**. The citation is as follows:
> Pei Sun, Henrik Kretzschmar, Xerxes Dotiwalla, Aurelien Chouard, Vijaysai Patnaik, Paul Tsui, James Guo, Yin Zhou, Yuning Chai, and Benjamin Caine. *Scalability in perception for autonomous driving: Waymo open dataset*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), June 2020.

Since the paper primarily focuses on the **Waymo Open Dataset**, I will compile this information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and full citation.

After completing this process, I will have a clear and concise entry for the dataset used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
