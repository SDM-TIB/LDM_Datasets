To extract datasets from the research paper titled "GloVeInit at SemEval-2020 Task 1: Using GloVe Vector Initialization for Unsupervised Lexical Semantic Change Detection" by Vaibhav Jain, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the paper is based on the SemEval-2020 Task 1, which involves two corpora from different time periods. This suggests that datasets are involved, but I need to find their specific names and details.

Next, I will examine **section 3 (Results and Experimental Setup)**, where the author discusses the datasets used for the experiments. Here, the paper mentions that the dataset provided by the competition organizers consists of two corpora, C1 and C2, for four languages: English, German, Latin, and Swedish. However, it does not provide specific names for these corpora, so I will need to look for additional context or references.

I will also check the **References section** to see if there are any citations related to the datasets. The paper cites the work of Schlechtweg et al. (2020), which is the official reference for the SemEval-2020 Task 1. This reference may provide more detailed information about the datasets used in the task.

The citation for the SemEval-2020 Task 1 is:
> Dominik Schlechtweg, Barbara McGillivray, Simon Hengchen, Haim Dubossarsky, and Nina Tahmasebi. *In Proceedings of the 14th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation, Barcelona, Spain. Association for Computational Linguistics, 2020.*

Additionally, I will note that the paper mentions the datasets were preprocessed and provided in tokenized and lemmatized form, but it does not specify the exact names of the corpora. Therefore, I will include the general description of the datasets as they relate to the task.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citation for the SemEval-2020 Task 1 dataset as the authoritative source.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited.
