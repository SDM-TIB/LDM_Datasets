To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Intraday Trading Algorithm for Predicting Cryptocurrency Price Movements Using Twitter Big Data Analysis" by Vahidin Jeleskovic and Stephen Mackay, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study analyzes the impact of Twitter messages on cryptocurrency price movements, suggesting that datasets related to Twitter data and trading data are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their analysis. They mention two primary datasets:

1. **Historical Twitter Messages Dataset**: This dataset consists of the latest 3,200 tweets from various cryptocurrency foundation channels, totaling 147,111 messages. It includes 88 columns of information about each tweet, such as timestamps and hashtags.

2. **Historical Trading Data from Binance**: This dataset includes trading data with open, high, low, close, and volume indicators (OHLCV) in 1-minute intervals for all cryptocurrency pairs listed on Binance. The dataset spans from January 2, 2018, to November 10, 2018, containing 450,000 observations per cryptocurrency.

In the **results section**, the authors analyze the impact of these datasets on price movements, confirming their relevance and significance in the context of the study.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. However, since the datasets are derived from APIs (Twitter API and Binance API), I will note that the citations for these datasets are as follows:

- For the **Twitter dataset**, the citation is:
  > Twitter. *GET statuses/user_timeline*. Available at: https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/timelines/api-reference/get-statuses-user_timeline

- For the **Binance trading data**, the citation is:
  > Binance. *Binance Official API Docs*. Available at: https://github.com/binance-exchange/binance-official-api-docs/blob/master/rest-api.md

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
