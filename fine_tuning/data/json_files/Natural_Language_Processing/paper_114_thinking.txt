To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-layer Representation Learning for Medical Concepts" by Edward Choi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned or referenced. The abstract indicates that the authors used a large EHR dataset with over 3 million visits, which suggests that a dataset is indeed involved.

Next, I will look into **section 4 (Experiments)**, specifically **subsection 4.1 (Dataset description)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention two datasets:

1. **Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta (CHOA) Dataset**: This dataset consists of visit records from Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta, containing various medical codes (diagnosis, medication, procedure codes). The authors note that the data is fully de-identified and does not include any personal health information (PHI).

2. **CMS Dataset**: This is a publicly available synthetic EHR dataset. The authors provide basic statistics about this dataset, indicating that it has more patients but fewer unique medical codes compared to the CHOA dataset.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. However, since the CHOA dataset is proprietary and the CMS dataset is publicly available, the citation for the CMS dataset can be found in the references:

- For the **CMS Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. *OASIS Data Set*. Available at: https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Quality-Initiatives-Patient-Assessment-Instruments/OASIS/DataSet.html.

The CHOA dataset does not have a formal citation in the references, as it is proprietary data.

Now, I will compile the information about each dataset, ensuring to include the full citation for the CMS dataset and a note about the CHOA dataset being proprietary.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for further processing or review.
