To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Inertia-aware 3D Human Modeling with Pose Sequence" by Yutong Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. In the abstract, the authors introduce a novel dataset called **I3D-Human**, which is a strong indication that this is a primary dataset of interest.

Next, I will look for specific details about the **I3D-Human dataset** in the **introduction** and **methodology sections**. The introduction mentions that the dataset captures variations in clothing appearance under approximately identical poses, which provides context for its purpose. The methodology section further elaborates on the dataset, including the capturing equipment used (10 DJI Osmo Action cameras) and the number of frames recorded (10k frames from 6 subjects).

In the **experiments section**, the authors confirm that they primarily evaluate their method on the **I3D-Human dataset**, which reinforces its significance in their research.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the **I3D-Human dataset**. However, since this dataset is self-collected by the authors, it may not have a traditional citation like other datasets. Instead, I will note that the dataset is described in detail within the paper itself and that the authors plan to release it for research purposes.

Next, I will also look for any other datasets mentioned in the paper. The authors reference existing datasets such as **ZJU-MoCap**, **PeopleSnapshot**, and **Human3.6M** in the context of their work. I will extract the relevant citations for these datasets as well.

The citations I will compile are as follows:

1. **I3D-Human Dataset**: 
   - This dataset is self-collected and described in detail in the paper. The authors will release it for research purposes.

2. **ZJU-MoCap Dataset**:
   > Peng, S., Zhang, Y., Xu, Y., Wang, Q., Shuai, Q., Bao, H., & Zhou, X. (2021). Neural body: Implicit neural representations with structured latent codes for novel view synthesis of dynamic humans. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2021, 9054–9063. 

3. **PeopleSnapshot Dataset**:
   > Wu, M., Wang, Y., Hu, Q., & Yu, J. (2020). Multi-view neural human rendering. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 1682–1691.

4. **Human3.6M Dataset**:
   > Ionescu, C., Papava, D., Olaru, V., & Sminchisescu, C. (2014). Human3.6m: Large scale datasets and predictive methods for 3D human sensing in natural environments. IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 36(7), 1325–1339.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets in a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly identified along with its citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
