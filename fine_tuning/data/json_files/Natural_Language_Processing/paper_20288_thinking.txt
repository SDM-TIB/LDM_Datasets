To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Improving Real-Time Omnidirectional 3D Multi-Person Human Pose Estimation with People Matching and Unsupervised 2D-3D Lifting" by Pawel Knap et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions, but I need to look for specific datasets.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of 3D human pose estimation and mention the use of mmWave radars and omnidirectional cameras. However, they do not explicitly name any datasets here.

Next, I will examine the **methodology section**, particularly the parts where they describe the data fetching and 2D keypoint localization. They mention using **OpenPose** for 2D keypoint detection, which is a tool rather than a dataset. However, they also refer to **Human3.6M** as the dataset used for training their 2D-3D lifting network (LInKs). This is a significant dataset in the field of human pose estimation.

In the **results section**, the authors present quantitative results related to their experiments but do not introduce any new datasets. They primarily focus on the performance of their methods using the datasets mentioned earlier.

Now, I will consult the **references section** to find the full citation for the dataset mentioned:

1. **Human3.6M Dataset**: The citation is:
   > C. Ionescu, D. Papava, V. Olaru, and C. Sminchisescu. *Human3.6m: Large scale datasets and predictive methods for 3d human sensing in natural environments*. IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, vol. 36, pp. 1325â€“1339, Jul 2014.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets explicitly, I will summarize the findings:

- The only dataset identified is **Human3.6M**, which is used for training the LInKs model for 2D-3D lifting.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for **Human3.6M** using the required format, ensuring that the citation is included for proper referencing.
