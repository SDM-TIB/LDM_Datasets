To extract datasets from the research paper titled "P2PFormer: A Primitive-to-polygon Method for Regular Building Contour Extraction from Remote Sensing Images" by Tao Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on the **WHU, CrowdAI, and WHU-Mix datasets**, which suggests that these datasets are crucial for the research.

Next, I will look for specific details about these datasets in the **experiments section**. The authors provide a description of each dataset:

1. **CrowdAI Dataset**: This dataset is described as a challenging satellite dataset for building segmentation, containing **280,741 training images** and **60,317 test images**, with each image sized **300×300 pixels**.

2. **WHU Dataset**: This dataset consists of high-quality aerial images and annotations, with **2793 training images**, **627 validation images**, and **2220 test images**, each sized **1024×1024 pixels**.

3. **WHU-Mix Dataset**: This is a large mixed dataset with COCO format building boundary annotations, containing **43,778 training images**, **2922 validation images**, **11,675 test images** for test1, and **6011 test images** for test2.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The CrowdAI dataset citation is:
- Mohanty, S. P. (2019). *CrowdAI mapping challenge 2018 dataset*. Retrieved from https://www.crowdai.org/challenges/mapping-challenge.

The WHU dataset citation is:
- Wei, S., Ji, S., & Lu, M. (2019). *Toward automatic building footprint delineation from aerial images using CNN and regularization*. IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing, 58(3), 2178-2189.

The WHU-Mix dataset citation is:
- Wei, S., Zhang, T., Ji, S., Luo, M., & Gong, J. (2023). *Buildmapper: A fully learnable framework for vectorized building contour extraction*. ISPRS Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, 197, 87-104.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and full citation for each dataset. This will ensure that the datasets are accurately represented and properly cited for future reference.
