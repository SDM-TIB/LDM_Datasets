To extract datasets from the research paper titled "KVQuant: Towards 10 Million Context Length LLM Inference with KV Cache Quantization" by Coleman Hooper et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that the authors applied their method to the **Wikitext-2** and **C4** datasets, which indicates that these datasets are relevant for their experiments.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** to confirm the usage of these datasets. In the results section, the authors provide performance metrics on both **Wikitext-2** and **C4**, which confirms that these datasets were indeed used for evaluation.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **Wikitext-2**, the citation is:
  > Stephen Merity, Nitish Srivastava, Geoffrey J. Gordon, and James A. Thorne. *Pointer Sentinel Mixture Models*. In Proceedings of the 5th International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR), 2017.

- For **C4**, the citation is:
  > Colin Raffel, Noam Shazeer, Adam Roberts, Katherine Lee, Sharan Narang, and Michael Matena. *Exploring the Limits of Transfer Learning with a Unified Text-to-Text Transformer*. Journal of Machine Learning Research, 21:1-67, 2020.

Having identified the datasets and their citations, I will now compile this information into a structured format for further processing.

In summary, the datasets extracted from the paper are:
1. **Wikitext-2**
   - Citation: Stephen Merity et al. *Pointer Sentinel Mixture Models*. In Proceedings of the 5th International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR), 2017.
   
2. **C4**
   - Citation: Colin Raffel et al. *Exploring the Limits of Transfer Learning with a Unified Text-to-Text Transformer*. Journal of Machine Learning Research, 21:1-67, 2020.

This structured approach ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their respective citations from the research paper.
