To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Information Extraction from Historical Well Records Using a Large Language Model" by Zhiwei Ma et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract indicates that the authors tested their workflow on a dataset of **160 well documents**, which suggests that this is a dataset of interest.

Next, I will look for more detailed descriptions in the **methodology section**. In section 2.2, the authors specify that they analyzed **two types of well records**: well drilling completion reports from Colorado and well record reports from Pennsylvania. They mention that the preliminary dataset includes **150 well drilling completion reports from Colorado** and **10 well records from Pennsylvania**. This gives me the specific datasets used in their study.

Now, I need to ensure I have the full citations for these datasets. I will check the **References section** to find any relevant citations that correspond to the datasets mentioned. However, it appears that the datasets themselves (i.e., the well records) are not formally published datasets with citations but rather internal datasets compiled for the study.

Since the paper does not provide formal citations for these datasets, I will document them as follows:

1. **Colorado Well Drilling Completion Reports**: A dataset consisting of 150 well drilling completion reports from Colorado, used for testing the information extraction workflow.

2. **Pennsylvania Well Records**: A dataset consisting of 10 well records from Pennsylvania, also used for testing the information extraction workflow.

While these datasets do not have formal citations like published datasets, I will note that they are part of the internal data used in the study.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for clarity and future reference. This will include the dataset names, descriptions, and any relevant notes about their usage in the research.
