To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Differentially private exact recovery for stochastic block models" by Dung Nguyen and Anil Vullikanti, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may highlight key datasets used in the study.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments and results sections**, as these typically contain detailed information about the datasets used for evaluation. I will look for any specific names of datasets, descriptions, and the context in which they were used.

After identifying potential datasets, I will check the **references section** of the paper to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to ensure that the datasets can be easily located by others.

I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **Stochastic Block Models (SBMs)**: The paper discusses various types of SBMs, but it does not specify a dataset name. Instead, it describes the theoretical framework and algorithms developed for community detection in SBMs.

2. **Binary Asymmetric SBM (BASBM)**: The authors refer to the BASBM as a model rather than a dataset. They provide theoretical results based on this model.

3. **Censored Binary SBM (CBSBM)**: Similar to the BASBM, the CBSBM is a model discussed in the context of the paper, but no specific dataset is mentioned.

4. **General Structure SBM (GSSBM)**: Again, this is a model discussed in the paper without reference to a specific dataset.

Since the paper primarily focuses on theoretical models rather than empirical datasets, I will note that while the authors reference various SBMs, they do not provide specific datasets or citations for datasets used in experiments.

Finally, I will compile the findings into a structured format, ensuring that any references to models are clearly distinguished from actual datasets, and I will include full citations for any referenced works that provide foundational information on the SBMs discussed.

In conclusion, while the paper discusses several models of SBMs, it does not provide specific datasets or citations for datasets used in experiments. Therefore, I will document the models and their theoretical implications rather than specific datasets.
