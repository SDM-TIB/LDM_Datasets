To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Propagation and Attribution of Uncertainty in Medical Imaging Pipelines" by Leonhard F. Feiner et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the use of a realistic imaging pipeline, which suggests that datasets are involved, but I need to find specific names.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of uncertainty estimation in medical imaging pipelines, but they do not explicitly mention datasets. I will continue to the **methods section** where they describe their approach in detail.

In **section 4 (Experiments and Results)**, the authors detail their experiments and mention two specific datasets:

1. **fastMRI Dataset**: This dataset is used for the reconstruction and classification of knee MR images. It contains reference images and raw k-space data, which are undersampled with varying acceleration rates. The authors reference the dataset as follows:
   > Zbontar, J., Knoll, F., Sriram, A., et al. *fastMRI: An open dataset and benchmarks for accelerated MRI*. arXiv preprint (2018).

2. **Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) Dataset**: This dataset is utilized for the reconstruction of brain MR images and includes 818 MR images. The authors cite it as:
   > Petersen, R.C., Aisen, P., Beckett, L.A., et al. *Alzheimer’s disease neuroimaging initiative (ADNI): Clinical characterization*. Neurology 74(3), 201–209, 2010.

Next, I will verify the citations in the **References section** to ensure they are accurate and complete. 

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their full citations, ensuring that I follow the required format for each dataset.

After completing this process, I will have a structured output that clearly lists the datasets used in the research, along with their full citations, ready for further processing or review.
