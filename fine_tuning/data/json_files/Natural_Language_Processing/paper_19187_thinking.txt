To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Kernel KMeans clustering splits for end-to-end unsupervised decision trees" by Louis Ohl et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to find any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors compare their method on multiple datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed used.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for benchmarking their method. In this section, they mention that they cover datasets used for benchmarking by Laber et al. (2023) and Frost et al. (2020), as well as those from the Fundamental Clustering Data Suite by Bertsimas et al. (2021). This suggests that I need to look for specific dataset names and their characteristics.

In **Table 6**, the authors provide a summary of the datasets used in their experiments, including the number of samples, features, and classes for each dataset. The datasets listed include:

1. **Atom**: 800 samples, 3 classes.
2. **Avila**: 20,867 samples, 12 classes.
3. **Breast Cancer**: 683 samples, 2 classes.
4. **Car evaluation**: 1,728 samples, 4 classes.
5. **Chainlink**: 1,000 samples, 3 classes.
6. **US Congress**: 435 samples, 2 classes.
7. **Engytime**: 4,096 samples, 2 classes.
8. **Digits**: 1,797 samples, 10 classes.
9. **Haberman Survival**: 306 samples, 2 classes.
10. **Hepta**: 212 samples, 3 classes.
11. **Iris**: 150 samples, 3 classes.
12. **Lsun**: 404 samples, 3 classes.
13. **Mice protein**: 552 samples, 8 classes.
14. **Target**: 770 samples, 6 classes.
15. **Tetra**: 400 samples, 2 classes.
16. **Twodiamonds**: 800 samples, 2 classes.
17. **Vowel**: 990 samples, 10 classes.
18. **Wine**: 178 samples, 3 classes.
19. **Wingnut**: 1,016 samples, 2 classes.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The authors reference several papers that may contain the original datasets or descriptions of them. 

For example, the **Breast Cancer dataset** is commonly known and can be cited as:
> Wolberg, W. H., & Mangasarian, O. L. (1990). Multisurface method of pattern separation for medical diagnosis applied to breast fine-needle aspirates. *Cancer Letters*, 77(2), 163-171.

The **Iris dataset** is a well-known dataset and can be cited as:
> Fisher, R. A. (1936). The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems. *Annals of Eugenics*, 7(2), 179-188.

I will compile the dataset entries along with their citations into a structured format for clarity and future reference.

After gathering all necessary information, I will ensure that each dataset is documented with its full citation, as this is crucial for proper attribution and further research.
