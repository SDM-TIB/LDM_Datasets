To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Enhancing Brazilian Sign Language Recognition through Skeleton Image Representation" by Carlos Eduardo G. R. Alves et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant details, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their method on two widely recognized datasets in Brazilian Sign Language (LIBRAS), which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experimental Methodology)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention two datasets:

1. **MINDS-Libras Dataset**: This dataset includes a subset of 20 distinct signs in LIBRAS, performed by 12 signers, resulting in a total of 1,158 video sequences. The signs were selected based on their phonological characteristics.

2. **LIBRAS-UFOP Dataset**: This dataset encompasses a subset of 56 distinct signs in LIBRAS performed by 5 signers. The authors provide details about the classification of signs based on movement and articulation, as well as the number of takes per sign.

To ensure I have the correct citations, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **MINDS-Libras Dataset**, the citation is:
  > T. M. Rezende, S. G. M. Almeida, and F. G. Guimarães. *Development and validation of a Brazilian sign language database for human gesture recognition*. Neural Comput. Appl., vol. 33, p. 10449–10467, Aug 2021.

- For **LIBRAS-UFOP Dataset**, the citation is:
  > L. R. Cerna, E. E. Cardenas, D. G. Miranda, D. Menotti, and G. Camara-Chavez. *A multimodal LIBRAS-UFOP Brazilian sign language dataset of minimal pairs using a Microsoft Kinect sensor*. Expert Systems with Applications, vol. 167, p. 114179, 2021.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their relevant details as presented in the paper.
