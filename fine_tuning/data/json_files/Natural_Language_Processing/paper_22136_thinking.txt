To extract datasets from the research paper titled "PackVFL: Efficient HE Packing for Vertical Federated Learning" by Liu Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

Next, I will specifically look for a **dedicated section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the methodology or experiments sections. In this paper, I will focus on sections that discuss the experiments, as they typically detail the datasets used for evaluation.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention using the **SUSY dataset** and the **NUS-WIDE dataset** for their experiments. I will gather details about these datasets, including their characteristics and any relevant statistics provided in the paper.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets easily.

1. **SUSY Dataset**: The authors mention using this dataset for efficiency experiments, focusing on computation and communication aspects. The citation is:
   > Pierre Baldi, Peter Sadowski, and Daniel Whiteson. *Searching for exotic particles in high-energy physics with deep learning*. Nature communications 5, 1 (2014), 1–9.

2. **NUS-WIDE Dataset**: This dataset is used for accuracy experiments, as it contains heterogeneous features suitable for the VFL scenario. The citation is:
   > Tat-Seng Chua, Jinhui Tang, Richang Hong, Haojie Li, Zhiping Luo, and Yan-Tao Zheng. *NUS-WIDE: A Real-World Web Image Database from National University of Singapore*. In Proc. of ACM Conf. on Image and Video Retrieval (CIVR’09), Santorini, Greece, 2009.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will help maintain clarity and ensure that all necessary details are captured for future reference or analysis.
