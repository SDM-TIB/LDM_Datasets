To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Vocabulary Attack to Hijack Large Language Model Applications" by Patrick Levi and Christoph P. Neumann, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of two popular open-source LLMs, Llama2 and Flan-T5, but does not explicitly mention datasets. I will need to look further into the paper.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section IV) closely, as this is where datasets are often detailed. The authors mention using 35 test cases based on previous work, specifically referencing the experiments conducted by another study ([8]). However, they do not provide specific dataset names or citations in this section.

I will also check the **related work section** (Section II) for any references to datasets used in previous studies. The authors cite several works ([6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [12]) that may have utilized datasets relevant to their experiments. I will need to look up these references to see if they include datasets that are applicable to the current study.

In the **references section**, I will locate the full citations for the works cited in the paper. This will help me identify any datasets that were used in the referenced studies. For example, if [8] refers to a dataset used in their experiments, I will extract that information.

After gathering all relevant information, I will compile the datasets and their citations. If the paper does not mention specific datasets directly, I will note that the authors relied on previous studies and provide citations for those studies instead.

Finally, I will ensure that each dataset entry includes a full citation, formatted correctly, to maintain academic integrity and provide proper credit to the original sources. This will be crucial for any downstream processing or review of the extracted datasets.

By following these steps, I will systematically extract and document the datasets referenced in the paper, ensuring that I capture all necessary details and citations.
