To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Word and Document Embeddings based on Neural Network Approaches" by Siwei Lai, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract typically provides a concise overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments and results sections**. These sections usually contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used for training and evaluation. I will look for specific mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and any relevant characteristics.

In this paper, I will pay particular attention to sections that discuss the **evaluation metrics and tasks**, as they often reference the datasets used for those evaluations. For instance, if the paper mentions using datasets for tasks like sentiment analysis or text classification, I will note those datasets.

Once I identify the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets themselves.

For example, if the paper mentions using the **IMDB dataset** for sentiment analysis, I will look for the citation that describes the dataset's origin, such as:
> Maas, A. L., Daly, R. E., Pham, P. T., Huang, D., Ng, A. Y., & Potts, C. (2011). Learning word vectors for sentiment analysis. In Proceedings of the 49th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL), pages 142â€“150.

Similarly, if the paper discusses the **20 Newsgroups dataset**, I will find its citation:
> Lang, K. (1995). Newsweeder: Learning to filter netnews. In Proceedings of the 1995 International Conference on Machine Learning, pages 331-339.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the datasets into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset entry includes its name, description, and full citation.

Finally, I will review the extracted information to ensure accuracy and completeness before finalizing the dataset entries for presentation or further analysis.
