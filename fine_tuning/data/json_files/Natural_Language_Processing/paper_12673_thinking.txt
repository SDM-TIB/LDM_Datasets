To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Integrating Optimal EV Charging in the Energy Management of Electric Railway Stations" by Georgia Pierrou and Gabriela Hug, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and numerical study sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses a numerical study on an actual railway station in Chur, Switzerland, which suggests that there may be specific datasets related to this study.

Next, I will focus on the **numerical study section (Section V)**, where the authors describe the case study setup. Here, they mention that data sets corresponding to Churâ€™s daily train demand and regenerative braking (RB) profiles are provided by the Swiss Federal Railways. This indicates that there are specific datasets used for the simulations.

I will also look for any references to datasets in the **acknowledgments and references sections**. The authors acknowledge the Swiss Federal Railways for providing the railway consumption and solar radiation data, which suggests that these datasets are significant for the study.

Now, I will compile the datasets identified:

1. **Chur Daily Train Demand Dataset**: This dataset includes daily train demand data specific to the railway station in Chur, Switzerland, provided by the Swiss Federal Railways.

2. **Regenerative Braking Profiles Dataset**: This dataset contains profiles of regenerative braking energy available at the Chur railway station, also provided by the Swiss Federal Railways.

3. **Solar Radiation Data**: The authors mention using actual daily solar radiation data provided by the Swiss Federal Railways for their simulations.

Next, I will check the **References section** for full citations of the datasets mentioned. The relevant citations are:

- For the Chur Daily Train Demand and RB Profiles:
  > Swiss Federal Railways. *Daily train demand and regenerative braking profiles data*. [Online]. Available: [URL if available].

- For the Solar Radiation Data:
  > Swiss Federal Railways. *Daily solar radiation data*. [Online]. Available: [URL if available].

After gathering this information, I will ensure that each dataset is clearly described and that the full citations are included. This will allow for proper referencing and validation of the datasets used in the research.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
