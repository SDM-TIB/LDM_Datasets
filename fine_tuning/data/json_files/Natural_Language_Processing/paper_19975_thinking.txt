To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Spectral Phase Transition and Optimal PCA in Block-Structured Spiked Models" by Pierre Mergny, Justin Ko, and Florent Krzakala, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the inhomogeneous spiked Wigner model and its applications, but does not mention specific datasets. The introduction provides context about the spiked Wigner model and its relevance in various learning scenarios, but again, no datasets are named.

Next, I will examine the **main theoretical results section** and any subsequent sections that might detail experiments or applications of the model. I will look for any references to datasets used for validation or testing of the proposed methods. If the authors refer to any datasets, I will note their names and any relevant details provided.

I will also check the **references section** to see if any datasets are cited there. Often, datasets are introduced in the context of previous works, and the authors may provide citations for those datasets.

If I find any datasets mentioned, I will ensure to extract the full citation for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and for readers who may wish to access the datasets themselves.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. If no datasets are found, I will note that as well.

In summary, my steps will be:
1. Read the abstract, introduction, and results sections for mentions of datasets.
2. Examine the main theoretical results and any experimental sections for dataset references.
3. Check the references section for any cited datasets.
4. Document the datasets with full citations if found, or note the absence of datasets if applicable.
