To extract datasets from the research paper titled "TAIWAN-LLM: Bridging the Linguistic Divide with a Culturally Aligned Language Model" by Yen-Ting Lin and Yun-Nung Chen, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors have developed a model using a comprehensive pretraining corpus and instruction-finetuning datasets, which suggests that there are specific datasets involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used in their work. Here, they mention three primary datasets:

1. **Continue-Pretraining Corpus**: This dataset is a large collection of documents from various sources, specifically curated to represent the Taiwanese context. However, the paper does not provide a specific citation for this dataset, as it is a compilation of various sources.

2. **Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) Data**: This dataset includes a diverse set of instruction datasets, including a unique dataset called **Taiwan Instruction**, which consists of author-written conversations designed to capture cultural nuances. Again, no specific citation is provided for this dataset.

3. **Feedback Supervised Fine-Tuning (Feedback SFT) Data**: This dataset comprises 20,000 user feedback instances collected from a dedicated platform. The authors do not provide a citation for this dataset either.

Since the datasets mentioned are not associated with specific publications, I will note that they are original datasets created or compiled by the authors. However, I will still need to provide citations for the instruction datasets mentioned in **Table 2** of the paper, which are sourced from various existing datasets. I will look for the references in the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets.

For example, I will check the references for datasets like **SuperNI**, **Flan V2**, and others listed in Table 2. Each of these datasets will have its own citation that I will need to extract.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include any relevant citations for the instruction datasets while noting that the continue-pretraining corpus and the Taiwan Instruction dataset are original contributions without specific citations.

Finally, I will summarize my findings, ensuring that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations for potential downstream processing or review.
