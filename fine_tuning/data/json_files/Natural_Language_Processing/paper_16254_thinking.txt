To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Gene expression in growing cells: A biophysical primer" by Ido Golding and Ariel Amir, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus, which may hint at the types of datasets used. The introduction often discusses previous work and may reference specific datasets that the authors build upon.

Next, I will examine the **results and discussion sections** closely. These sections typically contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the experiments, including any specific measurements or observations made. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and the context in which they were used.

I will also check the **figures and tables** throughout the paper, as they often summarize key datasets and findings. Each figure or table may have a caption that describes the dataset used, which is crucial for understanding the data's relevance.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is essential for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily.

For example, if the authors mention using a dataset from a previous study, I will ensure to note the full citation as follows:

- If they reference a dataset from a specific paper, I will format it like this:
  > Author(s). *Title of the Paper*. Journal Name, Volume(Issue), Page Numbers, Year.

- If they mention a dataset that is publicly available, I will include the dataset's name and the source, such as:
  > Dataset Name. Available at: URL (Accessed: Date).

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will help maintain clarity and ensure that all relevant datasets are documented accurately for future reference.
