To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Velde: constructing cell potential landscapes by RNA velocity vector field decomposition" by Junbo Jia and Luonan Chen, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, results, and conclusion sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the method is validated using both synthetic and real datasets, which indicates that there are specific datasets that will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **results section**, particularly the subsections that describe the application of the method to datasets. In **section 3.2**, the authors explicitly mention three real scRNA-seq datasets used for validation:

1. **Dentategyrus scRNA-seq dataset**: This dataset is referenced in relation to the work by La Manno et al. (2018), which provides context for its use in the study.

2. **Human hematopoiesis scRNA-seq dataset**: This dataset is linked to the work by Qiu et al. (2022), indicating its relevance in the context of the research.

3. **Pancreatic development scRNA-seq dataset**: This dataset is cited from the work by Bastidas-Ponce et al. (2019), which is crucial for understanding the method's application in a biological context.

I will then check the **References section** to gather the full citations for each of these datasets:

- For the **Dentategyrus scRNA-seq dataset**, the citation is:
  > La Manno, G., Soldatov, R., Zeisel, A., Braun, E., Hochgerner, H., Petukhov, V., Lidschreiber, K., Kastriti, M. E., Lönnerberg, P., Furlan, A., et al. (2018). RNA velocity of single cells. *Nature*, 560(7719):494–498.

- For the **Human hematopoiesis scRNA-seq dataset**, the citation is:
  > Qiu, X., Zhang, Y., Martin-Rufino, J. D., Weng, C., Hosseinzadeh, S., Yang, D., Pogson, A. N., Hein, M. Y., Min, K. H. J., Wang, L., et al. (2022). Mapping transcriptomic vector fields of single cells. *Cell*, 185(4):690–711.

- For the **Pancreatic development scRNA-seq dataset**, the citation is:
  > Bastidas-Ponce, A., Tritschler, S., Dony, L., Scheibner, K., Tarquis-Medina, M., Salinno, C., Schirge, S., Burtscher, I., Böttcher, A., Theis, F. J., et al. (2019). Comprehensive single cell mRNA profiling reveals a detailed roadmap for pancreatic endocrinogenesis. *Development*, 146(12):dev173849.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation, ready for further processing or review.
