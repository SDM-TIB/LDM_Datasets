To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Adaptive Taxonomy Learning and Historical Patterns Modelling for Patent Classification" by Tao Zou et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention the datasets used. The introduction often elaborates on the problem being addressed and may reference specific datasets.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, the authors mention two datasets:

1. **USPTO-200K**: This dataset consists of patent documents retrieved from the USPTO, specifically filtered to include documents from 2010 to 2019 that contain essential metadata such as assignee details, text descriptions, and IPC codes.

2. **CNPTD-200K**: This dataset records patent documents from technology companies in China, also covering the years 2010 to 2019, with similar filtering criteria as the USPTO-200K dataset.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For the **USPTO-200K dataset**, the citation is:
> United States Patent and Trademark Office. *USPTO Patent Full-Text and Image Database*. Retrieved from https://www.uspto.gov/patents-application-process/search-patents.

For the **CNPTD-200K dataset**, the citation is:
> National Intellectual Property Administration of China. *China Patent Database*. Retrieved from https://www.cnipa.gov.cn/.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format, ready for review or further processing.
