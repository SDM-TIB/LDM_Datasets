To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Group-Conditional Conformal Prediction via Quantile Regression Calibration for Crop and Weed Classification" by Paul Melki et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** to get an overview of the research context and any datasets that may be mentioned. The abstract discusses the application of conformal prediction in agricultural contexts, specifically for crop and weed classification, which suggests that there may be datasets related to these tasks.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental setup section** (Section 3), as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, the authors mention a "specialized proprietary dataset" consisting of **218,000 RGB images** annotated with six classes (corn, rapeseed, sugar beet, sunflower, weed, and background). This dataset is crucial for understanding the performance of their proposed methods.

I will also look for any additional datasets mentioned in the **results or discussion sections**. However, the primary dataset appears to be the one described in Section 3.1, which is used for the image classification task.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. In this case, the paper does not provide a specific citation for the proprietary dataset, as it is likely an internal dataset used by the authors. However, I will note that the authors reference other works related to conformal prediction and machine learning, which may be relevant for understanding the context of their dataset.

Since the proprietary dataset does not have a formal citation, I will document it as follows:

1. **Proprietary Dataset for Crop and Weed Classification**: This dataset consists of 218,000 RGB images annotated with six classes (corn, rapeseed, sugar beet, sunflower, weed, and background). It is gathered under real-world uncontrolled conditions across multiple locations.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for clarity and future reference. The focus will be on ensuring that the description is clear and that any relevant citations are included where applicable.
