To extract datasets from the research paper titled "How to Surprisingly Consider Recommendations? A Knowledge-Graph-based Approach" by Oliver Baumann et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** to get an overview of the datasets referenced. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their approach on two datasets: **LastFM listening histories** and **synthetic Netflix viewing profiles**. This indicates that there are at least two datasets to focus on.

Next, I will look into **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they specifically mention:

1. **LFM-1b Dataset**: This dataset is used for the music domain and contains 379 million listening events. It is enriched with additional datasets for acoustic features and musical genres.

2. **Netflix Titles Dataset**: This dataset includes 8,808 titles available on Netflix, covering movies and TV shows, along with their metadata.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **LFM-1b Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Schedl, M. (2016). *The LFM-1b Dataset for Music Retrieval and Recommendation*. In Proceedings of the 2016 ACM on International Conference on Multimedia Retrieval. ACM. https://doi.org/10.1145/2911996.2912004

- For the **Netflix Titles Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Netflix titles dataset. (2022). Available at: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/netflix-shows

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their respective citations for future reference.
