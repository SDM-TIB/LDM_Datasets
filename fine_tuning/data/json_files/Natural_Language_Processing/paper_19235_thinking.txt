To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Online Local False Discovery Rate Control: A Resource Allocation Approach" by Ruicheng Ao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for validation or experimentation.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as this is typically where authors describe the datasets they used for their analyses. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

In this paper, the authors mention conducting experiments on **time series data from New York City taxi passengers**. This indicates that there is a specific dataset being utilized for their empirical applications.

I will then check the **references section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The paper mentions that the dataset is sourced from the **Numenta Anomaly Benchmark (NAB)** repository, specifically the NYC taxi dataset. I will ensure to document the citation correctly.

The full citation for the NYC taxi dataset is:
> Ahmad, S., Lavin, A., Purdy, S., & Agha, Z. (2017). Unsupervised real-time anomaly detection for streaming data. *Neurocomputing*, 262, 134–147.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation.

1. **NYC Taxi Dataset**: This dataset records the number of taxi passengers in New York City every 30 minutes from July 1, 2014, to January 31, 2015. It captures fluctuations caused by major events such as the NYC marathon and holidays.

   Citation:
   > Ahmad, S., Lavin, A., Purdy, S., & Agha, Z. (2017). Unsupervised real-time anomaly detection for streaming data. *Neurocomputing*, 262, 134–147.

By following these steps, I have successfully extracted the relevant dataset from the paper and documented it with the necessary citation.
