To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The impact of Covid-19 vaccination in Aotearoa New Zealand: a modelling study" by Samik Datta et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, results, and discussion sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a summary of the study's objectives and findings, which may include references to datasets used. The introduction often outlines the context and significance of the research, potentially mentioning specific datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, as it typically details the datasets utilized in the study. In this paper, the authors mention using the **Health Service User (HSU) dataset** for population size by age and prioritised ethnicity. This dataset is crucial for understanding the demographics involved in the study.

I will also look for any supplementary materials or tables that may provide additional datasets or relevant information. For instance, the supplementary tables may contain specific data points or references to other datasets that were analyzed.

In the **results section**, the authors present findings based on the datasets used, which can help confirm the datasets' relevance and application in the study. I will take note of any specific metrics or outcomes derived from these datasets.

Finally, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. For the HSU dataset, the citation is:
> StatsNZ. *Review of health service user population methodology*. 2022. URL: https://www.stats.govt.nz/reports/review-of-health-service-user-population-methodology.

Additionally, I will look for any other datasets mentioned in the paper, such as those related to vaccination rates or demographic statistics, and ensure to capture their citations as well.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, including their descriptions and full citations, to ensure that they are ready for further processing or review.
