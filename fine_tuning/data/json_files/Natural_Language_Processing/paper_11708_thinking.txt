To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Hierarchical Matching and Reasoning for Multi-Query Image Retrieval" by Zhong Ji et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that extensive experiments were conducted on a benchmark dataset, which suggests that a specific dataset is used.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets and evaluation metrics)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, I will look for explicit mentions of dataset names, descriptions, and any relevant details such as the number of images, types of annotations, and how the dataset is split for training, validation, and testing.

In this paper, the authors mention using the **Visual Genome dataset**. I will note the details provided about this dataset, such as the number of images (105,414) and the specific splits for training, validation, and testing (92,105/5,000/9,896).

After identifying the dataset, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Visual Genome dataset. The citation typically includes the authors, title, publication venue, and year. For the Visual Genome dataset, the citation is:

> Ranjay Krishna, Yuke Zhu, Oliver Groth, Justin Johnson, Kenji Hata, Joshua Kravitz, Stephanie Chen, Yannis Kalantidis, Li-Jia Li, David A. Shamma, et al. *Visual Genome: Connecting Language and Vision Using Crowdsourced Dense Image Annotations*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 123(1):32â€“73, 2017.

Now that I have the dataset name, description, and citation, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines the dataset's relevance to the research.

Finally, I will ensure that all extracted information is accurate and ready for any further processing or analysis that may be required.
