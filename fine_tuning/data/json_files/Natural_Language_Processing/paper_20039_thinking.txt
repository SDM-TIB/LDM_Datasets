To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Survey of Application of Machine Learning in Wireless Indoor Positioning Systems" by Amala Sonny et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and conclusion** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract provides a general overview, and the introduction often highlights the significance of datasets in the context of the research.

Next, I will focus on **section VI (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly discuss various datasets related to indoor positioning systems. This section is likely to contain detailed descriptions of the datasets, including their names, technologies used, dimensions, and the number of data points.

In this section, I will identify the datasets mentioned, such as:

1. **UJIIndoorLoc**: A dataset created for WLAN fingerprint-based indoor localization, covering a university campus with a specific number of training and testing data points.
2. **UJIIndoorLoc-Mag**: A dataset that explores magnetic field variations alongside inertial sensor data.
3. **SODIndoorLoc**: A Wi-Fi-based dataset that includes multiple buildings and various access points.
4. **BLE dataset**: A dataset for Bluetooth Low Energy indoor positioning, detailing its structure and collection methodology.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access the datasets.

For example, the citation for **UJIIndoorLoc** might look like:
> Torres-Sospedra, J., et al. "UJIIndoorLoc: A new multi-building and multi-floor database for WLAN fingerprint-based indoor localization problems." In Proceedings of the International Conference on Indoor Positioning and Indoor Navigation (IPIN), 2014, pp. 261â€“270.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring that they are ready for review or further processing.
