To extract datasets from the research paper titled "PathRL: An End-to-End Path Generation Method for Collision Avoidance via Deep Reinforcement Learning" by Wenhao Yu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, method, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the performance of the proposed method in various scenarios, which may imply the use of datasets, but I need to find specific names.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention the challenges of existing DRL methods and the need for robust navigation strategies, but they do not specify datasets yet. I will continue to the **method section** where they describe the training process and environments used.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**. Here, the authors detail the scenarios used for testing the PathRL method, including static and dynamic environments. They mention using a customized simulator to collect experiences for training, but they do not explicitly name any datasets.

I will also check the **references section** for any cited datasets or related works that may have used specific datasets. However, it appears that the paper primarily discusses the methodology and results without referencing specific datasets used for training or evaluation.

Since the paper does not provide explicit dataset names or citations, I will summarize the findings as follows:

1. **Customized Simulator**: The authors created a custom simulator to generate random environments for training the navigation policy. This simulator is not a publicly available dataset but rather a tool developed for their experiments.

2. **Real-World Testing**: The authors mention deploying their method on a real-world Ackermann steering robot, but again, no specific datasets are cited for this real-world testing.

Given that no formal datasets are explicitly mentioned in the paper, I will note that the authors rely on a custom simulator and real-world scenarios for their experiments. Therefore, I will not be able to provide full citations for datasets as none are specified.

In conclusion, while I have thoroughly searched the paper for datasets, it appears that the authors did not utilize any publicly available datasets or provide citations for specific datasets. Instead, they focused on their custom simulation environments and real-world applications.
