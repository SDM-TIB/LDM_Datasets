To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SpikeMba: Multi-Modal Spiking Saliency Mamba for Temporal Video Grounding" by Wenrui Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the effectiveness of the proposed model across "mainstream benchmarks," which suggests that datasets are involved, but I need to find their specific names.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methods** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors mention evaluating their model on several datasets, which is a strong indication that specific datasets will be detailed.

Upon reviewing the **experiments section**, I find that the authors mention using the following datasets:

1. **QVHighlights**: This dataset is used for moment retrieval and highlight detection tasks. It is a well-known benchmark in the field of video grounding.

2. **Charades-STA**: This dataset is also mentioned as a benchmark for evaluating the model's performance in temporal grounding tasks.

3. **TACoS**: Another dataset used for moment retrieval, which focuses on video and language alignment.

4. **TVSum**: This dataset is used for highlight detection, providing a summary of web videos.

5. **Youtube-HL**: Similar to TVSum, this dataset is used for highlight detection in videos.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for future researchers.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, which is essential for reproducibility and further studies in the field.
