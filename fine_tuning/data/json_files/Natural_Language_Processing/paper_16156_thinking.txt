To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Cognitive bias in large language models: Cautious optimism meets anti-Panglossian meliorism" by David Thorstad, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections that discuss experiments or methodologies** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a general overview, but I will focus on sections that explicitly mention data or datasets used in the research.

In the **introduction**, the author discusses cognitive biases in large language models and references various studies. However, I need to look for specific datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will examine **sections 4 (Availability)** and **5 (Anchoring)**, as these sections detail specific experiments that likely involve datasets. In section 4.2, the author mentions the **Drug-Drug Interaction (DDI) dataset**, which is described as an annotated corpus of 1,017 texts detailing 5,021 interactions between various drugs. This dataset is crucial for understanding the availability bias in relation extraction tasks.

In section 5.2, the author discusses the **HumanEval dataset**, which is used to assess code generation tasks. This dataset consists of 164 programming problems, each with a function signature, an English description, and input-output pairs. This is another important dataset relevant to the research.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **Drug-Drug Interaction (DDI) dataset**, the citation is:
   > Segura-Bedmar, Isabel, Martínez, Paloma, and Herrero-Zazo, María. "SemEval-2013 Task 9: Extraction of Drug-Drug Interactions from Biomedical Texts (DDIExtraction 2013)." In Second Joint Conference on Lexical and Computational Semantics (*SEM*), Volume 2: Proceedings of the Seventh International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval 2013), 341–350. Atlanta, Georgia, USA: Association for Computational Linguistics, 2013.

2. For the **HumanEval dataset**, the citation is:
   > Chen, Mark, Tworek, Jerry, Jun, Heewoo, et al. "Evaluating Large Language Models Trained on Code." arXiv 2107.03374, 2021.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets and their details, ensuring that I include the full citations as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets referenced in the paper, ready for further processing or review.
