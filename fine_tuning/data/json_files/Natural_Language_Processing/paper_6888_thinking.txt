To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Discovering Language-neutral Sub-networks in Multilingual Language Models" by Negar Foroutan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and it may mention specific datasets used for evaluation or training.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental setup section** (Section 4), where the authors typically describe the tasks and datasets used in their experiments. In this section, I will look for explicit mentions of datasets, including their names and any relevant details such as the number of examples, languages covered, and specific tasks associated with each dataset.

From my reading of Section 4.2 (Tasks & Datasets), I note the following datasets:

1. **WikiAnn**: This dataset is used for Named Entity Recognition (NER) and is built on Wikipedia articles for 282 languages. The authors mention that Swahili is not included, and Hindi has a small data size, which is important for understanding the dataset's limitations.

2. **XNLI Dataset**: This dataset is used for Natural Language Inference (NLI) and includes a subset of examples from the MNLI dataset, translated into 14 languages. The authors note that Farsi is not included in this dataset.

3. **Masked Language Modeling (MLM)**: The authors mention using 512-token sequences from Wikipedia in each language as the training data for the MLM task. However, this is more of a description of the data source rather than a specific dataset name.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **WikiAnn**, the citation is:
  > Pan, Xiaoman, Boliang Zhang, Jonathan May, Joel Nothman, Kevin Knight, and Heng Ji. "Cross-lingual name tagging and linking for 282 languages." In Proceedings of the 55th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, ACL 2017, Vancouver, Canada, July 30 - August 4, Volume 1: Long Papers, pages 1946–1958. Association for Computational Linguistics.

- For **XNLI**, the citation is:
  > Conneau, Alexis, Ruty Rinott, Guillaume Lample, Adina Williams, Samuel R. Bowman, Holger Schwenk, and Veselin Stoyanov. "XNLI: Evaluating Cross-lingual Sentence Representations." In Proceedings of the 2018 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), pages 2475–2485.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described with its name, description, and full citation. This will allow for a clear and organized presentation of the datasets used in the research paper.
