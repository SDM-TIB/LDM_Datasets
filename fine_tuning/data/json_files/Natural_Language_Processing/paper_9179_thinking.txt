To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Ensuring reliability: what is the optimal time for power plant maintenance in Texas as the climate changes?" by Hugh Daigle et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors analyzed data from the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) to assess changes in shoulder seasons, which suggests that there are datasets related to electricity demand and temperature.

Next, I will focus on the **data and methods section** where the authors describe their analysis. They mention using **hourly load data from ERCOT** for electricity use and **temperature data from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Reanalysis 5 (ERA5)**. This section provides specific details about the datasets used, including the time range and the nature of the data.

The paper specifies that the electricity use data covers the period from **January 1, 1996, to the present**, with the exception of the year 2001. The temperature data from ERA5 dates back to **1959**. This information is crucial for understanding the datasets' scope.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **ERCOT hourly load data**, the citation is:
   > Electric Reliability Council of Texas. *ERCOT’s use of energy conservation*. Retrieved from https://www.ercot.com/files/docs/2021/08/04/Energy_Conservation_7-13-2022.pdf.

2. For the **ERA5 temperature data**, the citation is:
   > Hersbach, H., et al. (2020). *The ERA5 global reanalysis*. Quarterly Journal of the Royal Meteorological Society, 146(730), 1999–2049. doi:10.1002/qj.3803.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
