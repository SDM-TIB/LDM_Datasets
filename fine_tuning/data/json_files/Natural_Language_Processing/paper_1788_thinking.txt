To extract datasets from the research paper titled "qDKT: Question-centric Deep Knowledge Tracing" by Shashank Sonkar et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on several real-world datasets, which indicates that datasets are present. The introduction further elaborates on the use of two specific datasets, **ASSISTments 2009** and **ASSISTments 2017**, which are crucial for the experiments.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (section 5) where the authors provide a detailed description of the datasets used. They mention four datasets in total:

1. **ASSISTments 2009**: This dataset consists of 16,891 questions and has 4,151 learners. It is noted for having a low average number of observations per question, which affects model performance.

2. **ASSISTments 2017**: This dataset contains 1,183 questions and 1,709 learners. It has a higher average number of observations per question compared to ASSISTments 2009, which contributes to better model performance.

3. **Statics 2011**: This dataset is from an engineering statics course and includes 1,223 questions and 333 learners.

4. **Tutor**: This dataset comes from an online learning platform and includes 5,981 questions and 895 learners.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The paper provides a link for the ASSISTments datasets, which I will use to retrieve the necessary citation information.

For the **ASSISTments 2009** dataset, the citation is:
> "ASSISTments 2009 Dataset." Available at: https://sites.google.com/site/assistmentsdata/home

For the **ASSISTments 2017** dataset, the citation is:
> "ASSISTments 2017 Dataset." Available at: https://sites.google.com/site/assistmentsdata/home

For the **Statics 2011** dataset, the citation is:
> "Statics 2011 Dataset." Available at: https://pslcdatashop.web.cmu.edu/DatasetInfo?datasetId=507

For the **Tutor** dataset, the citation is not explicitly provided in the paper, but it can be referenced as:
> "Tutor Dataset." Available from the online learning platform.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.
