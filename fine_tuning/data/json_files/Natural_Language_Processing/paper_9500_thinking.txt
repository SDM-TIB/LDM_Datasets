To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Larger Language Models Do In-Context Learning Differently" by Jerry Wei et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, and the introduction typically outlines the context and significance of the study. In this case, the authors mention evaluating their methods across various NLP tasks, which suggests that multiple datasets may be involved.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experimental setup** or **methodology** sections. In this paper, the authors describe seven NLP tasks in **section 2.1 (Evaluation Tasks)**, which is a strong indication that specific datasets are being used for these tasks.

In **section 2.1**, the authors list the following datasets:
1. **SST-2 (Stanford Sentiment Treebank)**: Used for sentiment analysis.
2. **SUBJ (Subjectivity Dataset)**: Used for subjective/objective sentence classification.
3. **TREC (Text REtrieval Conference)**: Used for question classification.
4. **QQP (Quora Question Pairs)**: Used for duplicated-question recognition.
5. **RTE (Recognizing Textual Entailment)**: Used for textual entailment recognition.
6. **FP (Financial Sentiment Analysis)**: Used for financial sentiment analysis.
7. **ETHOS (Hate Speech Detection)**: Used for hate speech detection.

I will also check the **appendices** for any additional details or datasets mentioned. The appendix includes examples of prompts for each dataset, confirming their usage in the experiments.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset from the **References section** of the paper. Here are the citations for the datasets mentioned:

After compiling this information, I will ensure that each dataset is clearly documented, including its purpose and the corresponding citation, ready for further processing or review.
