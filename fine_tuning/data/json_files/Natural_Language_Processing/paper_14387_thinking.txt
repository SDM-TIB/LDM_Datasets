To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DeBERTinha: A Multistep Approach to Adapt DebertaV3 XSmall for Brazilian Portuguese Natural Language Processing Tasks" by Israel Campiotti et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and datasets sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of initial datasets from Carolina and BrWac, which indicates that these datasets are crucial for the study. 

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Datasets)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used in their research. Here, they explicitly mention two datasets:

1. **brWAC Dataset**: This dataset is described as a web crawl of Brazilian web pages, resulting in approximately 17.5 GB of processed text. It is noted that this dataset has been utilized in other works, such as BERTimbau.

2. **Carolina Dataset**: The authors describe this dataset as containing 823 million tokens and two million text entries, covering a diverse range of domains. They also mention that they only used the document body for their analysis.

In the same section, the authors discuss the preprocessing steps taken for both datasets, which include handling emojis and HTML tags, indicating the datasets' importance in their methodology.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **brWAC Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Jorge A Wagner Filho, Rodrigo Wilkens, Marco Idiart, and Aline Villavicencio. *The brwac corpus: A new open resource for Brazilian Portuguese*. In Proceedings of the Eleventh International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC 2018), 2018.

- For the **Carolina Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Marcelo Finger, Maria Clara Paixão de Sousa, Cristiane Namiuti, Vanessa Martins do Monte, Aline Silva Costa, Felipe Ribas Serras, Mariana Lourenço Sturzeneker, Raquel de Paula Guets, Renata Morais Mesquita, Guilherme Lamartine de Mello, Maria Clara Ramos Morales Crespo, Maria Lina de Souza Jeannine Rocha, Patrícia Brasil, Mariana Marques da Silva, and Mayara Feliciano Palma. *Carolina: The open corpus for linguistics and artificial intelligence*. https://sites.usp.br/corpuscarolina/corpus, 2022. Version 1.1 (Ada).

With this information, I will now summarize the datasets and their citations clearly, ensuring that I have captured all necessary details for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This will prepare me for any further processing or structuring of the data as needed.
