To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SDE+ - An Indicator for Constrained Multi-Objective Optimization" by Oladayo S. Ajani et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for evaluation. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets in relation to the research objectives.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. This is where the authors typically describe the datasets they used for their experiments, including details such as the number of instances, characteristics, and any specific configurations relevant to the study.

In this paper, I will specifically look for any references to benchmark suites or datasets that the authors used to evaluate their proposed method. For instance, if they mention using specific benchmark problems or datasets, I will note those down.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial as it provides the necessary context and source for the datasets used in the research.

For example, if the authors refer to benchmark suites like CF, LIRCMOP, or DASCMOP, I will look for the original papers or sources that describe these datasets to ensure I have the correct citations.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each entry is complete and accurately reflects the information provided in the paper.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for easy reference and further analysis, ensuring that all citations are correctly formatted and attributed to their respective sources.
