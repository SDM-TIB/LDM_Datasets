To extract datasets from the research paper titled "AN INFORMATION RETRIEVAL AND EXTRACTION TOOL FOR COVID-19 RELATED PAPERS" by Marcos V. L. Pivetta, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract mentions the **COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19)**, which is a significant dataset for this research. This indicates that I should look for more details about this dataset in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 1.1 (Data sources)**, where the author describes the CORD-19 dataset in detail. The paper states that CORD-19 is a curated source of articles about COVID-19 and related coronaviruses, created through collaboration with various organizations. It contains over 1 million articles, which is crucial information for understanding the dataset's scope.

Additionally, I will look for any other datasets mentioned in the paper. In **section 1.2.1**, the author references the **COVID-19 Research Aspect Dataset (CODA-19)**, which is constructed from CORD-19 abstracts and annotated by crowd workers. This dataset is also relevant and should be documented.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For **CORD-19**, the citation is:
   > Wang, L. L., Lo, K., Chandrasekhar, Y., Reas, R., Yang, J., Eide, D., Funk, K., Kinney, R., Liu, Z., Merrill, W., Mooney, P., Murdick, D., Rishi, D., Sheehan, J., Shen, Z., Stilson, B., Wade, A. D., Wang, K., Wilhelm, C., Xie, B., Raymond, D., Weld, D. S., Etzioni, O., & Kohlmeier, S. (2020). CORD-19: The Covid-19 Open Research Dataset. *arXiv preprint arXiv:2004.10706*.

2. For **CODA-19**, the citation is:
   > Huang, T.-H., Huang, C.-Y., Ding, C.-K. C., Hsu, Y.-C., & Giles, C. L. (2020). CODA-19: Reliably Annotating Research Aspects on 10,000+ CORD-19 Abstracts Using a Non-Expert Crowd. *Technical report*. URL: https://github.com/Mimino666/langdetect.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that highlights the key details and citations for each dataset. This will ensure that the datasets are properly documented and can be referenced accurately in future work.
