To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Computation-Efficient Era: A Comprehensive Survey of State Space Models in Medical Image Analysis," I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to look for any explicit mentions of datasets. The abstract provides a high-level overview, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used in the research.

Next, I will focus on the **sections that discuss specific applications or experiments**, particularly **section 4 (State Space Models in Action)**, which details various applications of Mamba models in medical imaging. This section is likely to contain references to datasets used for training or evaluation.

As I read through these sections, I will take note of any datasets mentioned, including their names, descriptions, and any relevant details such as the number of samples, types of data, and specific applications. For example, if the paper discusses a dataset used for medical image segmentation, I will look for details about the dataset's size, the types of images it contains, and its relevance to the study.

Once I have identified the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets themselves.

For instance, if the paper mentions a dataset like the "MIMIC-III clinical database," I will look for its citation in the references, which might include details such as the authors, title, publication year, and where it can be accessed.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation in the appropriate format.

Finally, I will organize this information clearly, ready for presentation or further processing, ensuring that all datasets are accurately represented and properly cited.
