To extract datasets from the research paper titled "FUM: Fine-grained and Fast User Modeling for News Recommendation" by Tao Qi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information and provide full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are referenced. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments on "two real-world datasets," which indicates that datasets are indeed involved.

Next, I will look closely at **section 3 (Experiment)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they refer to two datasets:

1. **MIND**: This is described as a public dataset based on user data sampled from Microsoft News. The authors provide some context about how the dataset was constructed and its relevance to their experiments.

2. **Feeds**: This dataset is based on user data sampled from the news feeds platform of Microsoft during a specific time frame. The authors detail how they selected impressions for training and evaluation.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets:

- For **MIND**, the citation is:
  > Fangzhao Wu, Ying Qiao, Jiun-Hung Chen, Chuhan Wu, Tao Qi, Jianxun Lian, Danyang Liu, Xing Xie, Jianfeng Gao, Winnie Wu, et al. *MIND: A large-scale dataset for news recommendation*. In ACL. 3597â€“3606, 2020.

- For **Feeds**, the dataset is derived from user data sampled from Microsoft, but the paper does not provide a separate citation for it. Instead, it is referenced in the context of the experiments, so I will note that it is based on internal data from Microsoft.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets in a structured manner, ensuring that I include the full citations as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.
