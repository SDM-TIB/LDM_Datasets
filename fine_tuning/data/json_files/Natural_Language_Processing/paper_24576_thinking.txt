To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MMR-Mamba: Multi-Modal MRI Reconstruction with Mamba and Spatial-Frequency Information Fusion" by Jing Zou et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that extensive experiments were conducted on the **BraTS** and **fastMRI knee datasets**, indicating that these datasets are crucial for the research.

Next, I will look closely at the **experiments section** where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used. In this section, they describe the **BraTS dataset** as containing both T1-weighted images (T1WIs) and T2-weighted images (T2WIs) from 100 3D MRI volumes, with a total of 3,621 images for training and 1,088 images for testing. They also mention the **fastMRI knee dataset**, which consists of single-coil proton density weighted images (PDWIs) and fat-suppressed PDWIs, with 227 training pairs and 45 testing pairs, resulting in 8,332 training images and 1,665 testing images.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For the **BraTS dataset**, the citation is:
  > Menze, B. H., Jakab, A., Bauer, S., Kalpathy-Cramer, J., Farahani, K., Kirby, J., Burren, Y., Porz, N., Slotboom, J., Wiest, R., et al. (2014). *The multimodal brain tumor image segmentation benchmark (brats)*. IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging, 34(10), 1993-2024.

- For the **fastMRI dataset**, the citation is:
  > Knoll, F., Zbontar, J., Sriram, A., Muckley, M. J., Bruno, M., Defazio, A., Parente, M., Geras, K. J., Katsnelson, J., Chandarana, H., et al. (2020). *fastMRI: A publicly available raw k-space and DICOM dataset of knee images for accelerated MR image reconstruction using machine learning*. Radiology: Artificial Intelligence, 2(1), e190007.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets and their citations clearly, ensuring that I have accurately represented the datasets used in the research.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
