To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Time Series Data Contribution via Influence Functions" by Yizi Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions and may mention specific datasets used for evaluation. In this case, the authors discuss their method, TimeInf, and its application to various real-world datasets, which suggests that datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 5), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention evaluating TimeInf on five benchmark datasets: **UCR**, **SMAP**, **MSL**, **NAB-Traffic**, and **SMD**. I will note these datasets and look for specific details about each one.

I will then check the **datasets subsection** (Section 5.1) for detailed descriptions. Here, the authors provide information about the datasets, including their characteristics and the context in which they are used. They mention that UCR features 250 time series from diverse fields, SMAP and MSL are NASA datasets monitoring spacecraft telemetry anomalies, and SMD is a dataset from an Internet company.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution. The citations for the datasets mentioned are as follows:

1. **UCR Dataset**:
   > Renjie Wu and Eamonn Keogh. *Current time series anomaly detection benchmarks are flawed and are creating the illusion of progress*. IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering, 2021.

2. **SMAP Dataset**:
   > NASA. *Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) Data*. Available at: https://smap.jpl.nasa.gov/data/.

3. **MSL Dataset**:
   > NASA. *Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) Data*. Available at: https://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/msl-raw-images/.

4. **NAB-Traffic Dataset**:
   > Subutai Ahmad, Alexander Lavin, Scott Purdy, and Zuha Agha. *Unsupervised real-time anomaly detection for streaming data*. Neurocomputing, 262:134–147, 2017.

5. **SMD Dataset**:
   > Ya Su, Youjian Zhao, Chenhao Niu, Rong Liu, Wei Sun, and Dan Pei. *Robust anomaly detection for multivariate time series through stochastic recurrent neural network*. In Proceedings of the 25th ACM SIGKDD international conference on knowledge discovery & data mining, pages 2828–2837, 2019.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their proper citations.
