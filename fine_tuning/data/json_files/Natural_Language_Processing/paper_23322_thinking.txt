To extract datasets from the research paper titled "TVB C++: A Fast and Flexible Back-End for The Virtual Brain" by Ignacio Mart√≠n et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions and may mention specific datasets or data sources used in the research. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets, so I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or data sources.

Next, I will carefully review the **methods** and **experiments** sections, as these typically contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the study. I will look for sections that specifically mention datasets, such as "Data Sources," "Dataset Description," or "Experimental Setup." 

In this paper, the authors discuss the use of structural connectomes and various input data formats, which may indicate the datasets they utilized. I will pay attention to any specific datasets mentioned, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. I will look for papers or resources that describe the datasets in detail.

For example, if the authors mention using a specific structural connectivity dataset, I will find the original paper that introduced that dataset and note its citation. Similarly, if they refer to any neuroimaging datasets, I will ensure to locate their corresponding citations.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset descriptions, including their names, characteristics, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented.

Finally, I will organize this information in a clear and concise manner, ready for further processing or review.
