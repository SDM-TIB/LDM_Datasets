To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Active Anomaly Detection based on Deep One-class Classification" by Minkyung Kim et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors analyze their method on **seven anomaly detection datasets**, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the **experiments section** (section 5) provides a table (Table 1) that lists the datasets used for evaluation, including their characteristics such as the number of samples, dimensions, and anomaly ratios.

The datasets mentioned in the paper are:

1. **NSL-KDD**: A dataset for network intrusion detection with 125,973 samples and an anomaly ratio of 46.5%.
2. **Ionosphere**: Contains 351 samples with an anomaly ratio of 35.9%.
3. **Arrhythmia**: Comprises 452 samples with an anomaly ratio of 14.6%.
4. **Cardio**: A dataset with 1,831 samples and an anomaly ratio of 9.6%.
5. **Mnist**: Contains 7,603 samples with an anomaly ratio of 9.2%.
6. **Glass**: A smaller dataset with 214 samples and an anomaly ratio of 4.2%.
7. **Optdigits**: Comprises 5,216 samples with an anomaly ratio of 2.9%.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The NSL-KDD dataset is referenced as follows:

- For **NSL-KDD**:

The other datasets may not have specific citations in the references, as they are commonly known datasets in the anomaly detection community. However, I will ensure to note their common usage in the field.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described with its characteristics and the appropriate citations where available. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
