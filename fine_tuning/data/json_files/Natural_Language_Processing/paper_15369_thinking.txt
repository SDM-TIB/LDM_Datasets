To extract datasets from the research paper titled "WojoodNER 2023: The First Arabic Named Entity Recognition Shared Task" by Mustafa Jarrar et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the introduction of novel NER datasets, specifically the **Wojood corpus**, which is a strong indication that this is the primary dataset of interest.

Next, I will look into **section 4 (Shared Task Datasets and Evaluation)**, as it is likely to contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the shared task. Here, the authors explicitly state that the **Wojood corpus** is the main dataset utilized for the shared task, providing key details about its size, token count, and the types of annotations it includes.

In this section, I will note the following details about the **Wojood corpus**:
- It contains approximately **550K tokens**.
- It includes annotations for **21 entity types**.
- The corpus encompasses both **Modern Standard Arabic (MSA)** and two dialects (Palestinian and Lebanese).

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the **Wojood corpus**. The citation provided in the paper is:
> Mustafa Jarrar, Mohammed Khalilia, and Sana Ghanem. *Wojood: Nested Arabic Named Entity Corpus and Recognition Using BERT*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC), Marseille, France, 2022.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the dataset details and ensure that I have the full citation ready for inclusion.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format that highlights the dataset name, description, and citation, ensuring that all necessary details are included for future reference or processing.
