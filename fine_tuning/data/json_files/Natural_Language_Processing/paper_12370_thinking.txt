To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Asymptotically Unbiased Synthetic Control Methods by Distribution Matching" by Masahiro Kato et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study and may mention any datasets used for validation or experimentation. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the research, which might include references to specific datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **experiments**. In this paper, I will specifically check sections that discuss the methodology or empirical analysis, as these sections typically detail the datasets used. I will pay attention to any tables or figures that might summarize the datasets or their characteristics.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention several datasets in the context of their empirical analysis. The relevant datasets identified are:

1. **Terrorist Conflict in Basque Country**: This dataset includes annual Spanish regional-level panel data from 1955 to 1997, focusing on the impact of terrorist activities on GDP. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Abadie, A., & Gardeazabal, J. (2003). The economic costs of conflict: A case study of the Basque Country. *American Economic Review*, 93(1), 113-132.

2. **Tobacco Control Program in California**: This dataset consists of annual state-level panel data from 1970 to 2000, examining the effects of a tobacco control program implemented in California. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Abadie, A., Diamond, A., & Hainmueller, J. (2010). Synthetic control methods for comparative case studies: Estimating the effect of Californiaâ€™s tobacco control program. *Journal of the American Statistical Association*, 105(490), 493-505.

3. **Reunification of Germany**: This dataset includes annual panel data at the country level from 1960 to 2003, analyzing the economic impact of the reunification of Germany. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Abadie, A., Diamond, A., & Hainmueller, J. (2015). Comparative politics and the synthetic control method. *American Journal of Political Science*, 59(2), 495-510.

After identifying these datasets, I will ensure to note their specific characteristics, such as the time periods covered, the types of data included (e.g., GDP, cigarette consumption), and any relevant covariates mentioned in the paper.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information along with their full citations in a structured format for easy reference. This will ensure that I have accurately captured all necessary details for each dataset mentioned in the paper.
