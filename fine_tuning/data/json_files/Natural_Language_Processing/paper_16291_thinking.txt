To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Volumetric 3D Point Cloud Attribute Compression: Learned Polynomial Bilateral Filter for Prediction" by Tam Thuc Do, Philip A. Chou, and Gene Cheung, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors demonstrate their method's performance over a wide range of point cloud datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe their experimental setup. Here, they mention that their training dataset comprises voxelized point clouds derived from 3D models publicly available on Sketchfab. They specifically state that they picked 10 meshes resembling the human form, which indicates a dataset but lacks a formal name.

In the same section, the authors list their evaluation dataset, which includes the following point clouds:
1. **Longdress**
2. **Redandblack**
3. **Loot**
4. **Soldier**

These names are crucial as they represent the datasets used for evaluation in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The authors refer to the MPEG point clouds, which are likely documented in the references. 

Upon reviewing the references, I find the following citation relevant to the datasets used:
- For the dataset comprising the point clouds Longdress, Redandblack, Loot, and Soldier, the citation is:
  > E. d’Eon, B. Harrison, T. Meyers, and P. A. Chou. *8i voxelized full bodies — a voxelized point cloud dataset*. Input document M74006 & m42914, ISO/IEC JTC1/SC29 WG1 & WG11 (JPEG & MPEG), Ljubljana, Slovenia, Jan. 2017.

Since the training dataset does not have a formal citation, I will note that it is derived from publicly available 3D models on Sketchfab, but it lacks a specific reference.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations. The final output will include the datasets identified, along with their full citations, ready for further processing or review.
