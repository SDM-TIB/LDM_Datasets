To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Boosting Transformers for Job Expression Extraction and Classification in a Low-Resource Setting" by Lukas Lange et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors participated in the MEDDOPROF competition, which suggests that there may be specific datasets associated with this task.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **Datasets** section or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors discuss their approach to the MEDDOPROF shared task, which involves the extraction and classification of job expressions in Spanish clinical texts. This implies that there is likely a dataset used for this task.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors refer to the **MEDDOPROF dataset**, which is specifically designed for the tasks they are addressing. They mention that this dataset includes job-related expressions in Spanish clinical texts, but I need to confirm the details and citation.

In the **References section**, I will look for any citations that provide the full details of the MEDDOPROF dataset. The authors reference the MEDDOPROF shared task in their citations, which will help me locate the original source of the dataset.

The citation for the MEDDOPROF dataset is:
> Lima-LÃ³pez, S., & Miranda-Escalada, A. (2021). *NLP applied to occupational health: MEDDOPROF shared task at IberLEF 2021 on automatic recognition, classification and normalization of professions and occupations from medical texts*. In Proceedings of the Iberian Languages Evaluation Forum (IberLEF 2021), CEUR Workshop Proceedings.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the dataset details:

1. **MEDDOPROF Dataset**: This dataset is used for the extraction and classification of job expressions in Spanish clinical texts. It is part of the MEDDOPROF shared task and includes various job-related expressions annotated for the competition.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, ensuring that I include the full citation for the MEDDOPROF dataset as it is crucial for proper attribution and reference.

After completing these steps, I will be ready to present the dataset information in the required format for further processing or review.
