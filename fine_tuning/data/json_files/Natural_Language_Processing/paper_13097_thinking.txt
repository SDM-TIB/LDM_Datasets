To extract datasets from the research paper titled "LesionMix: A Lesion-Level Data Augmentation Method for Medical Image Segmentation" by Berke Doga Basaran et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on "four brain MR lesion datasets and one liver CT lesion dataset," which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 3), where the authors describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, they explicitly list the datasets:

1. **MICCAI 2008 Multiple Sclerosis Lesion Dataset (MS2008)**: This dataset contains 20 samples and is referenced in the context of evaluating the LesionMix method.

2. **ISBI 2015 Longitudinal MS Lesion Dataset (MS2015)**: This dataset includes 21 samples and is also used for evaluation.

3. **MICCAI 2016 MS Lesion Dataset (MS2016)**: This dataset consists of 15 samples and is mentioned as part of the evaluation process.

4. **MICCAI 2017 White Matter Hyperintensity Dataset (WMH2017)**: This dataset has a training set of 60 samples and a test set of 110 samples, and it is used for training and testing the segmentation network.

5. **MICCAI 2017 Liver Tumor Segmentation Dataset (LiTS)**: This dataset contains CT scans for 131 subjects and is used for training and evaluation.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each of these datasets:

- For **MICCAI 2008 Multiple Sclerosis Lesion Dataset (MS2008)**, the citation is:
  > Styner, M., Lee, J., Chin, B., et al. "3D segmentation in the clinic: A grand challenge II: MS lesion segmentation." The MIDAS Journal, 2008.

- For **ISBI 2015 Longitudinal MS Lesion Dataset (MS2015)**, the citation is:

- For **MICCAI 2016 MS Lesion Dataset (MS2016)**, the citation is:

- For **MICCAI 2017 White Matter Hyperintensity Dataset (WMH2017)**, the citation is:

  > Bilic, P., Christ, P., Li, H.B., et al. "The liver tumor segmentation benchmark (LiTS)." Medical Image Analysis, 2023.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes its full citation. This structured approach will help in organizing the datasets effectively for further processing or review.
