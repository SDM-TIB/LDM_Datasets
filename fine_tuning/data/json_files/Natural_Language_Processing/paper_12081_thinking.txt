To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fairness and Diversity in Recommender Systems" by Yuying Zhao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's focus, but it may not contain detailed dataset information. The introduction often outlines the context and significance of the research, which may include references to datasets used in prior studies.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments or methodology sections**. In this paper, the authors discuss various fairness and diversity metrics, but I need to identify if they utilized specific datasets for their experiments. 

As I read through the paper, I will pay attention to any references to datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics. If the authors mention datasets used in their experiments, I will note down the details provided.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. I will ensure that I capture the authors, title, publication venue, and year for each dataset.

For example, if the paper mentions using the **MovieLens dataset**, I would look for the citation like this:
> F. Maxwell Harper and Joseph A. Konstan. *The MovieLens Datasets: History and Context*. ACM SIGKDD Explorations Newsletter, 5(1): 1-10, 2003.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset information in a structured format for easy reference, ensuring that all citations are complete and accurate for future use.
