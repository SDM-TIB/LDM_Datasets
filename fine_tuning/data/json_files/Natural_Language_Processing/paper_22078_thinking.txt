To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Using Artificial Intelligence Methods for the Studied Visual Analyzer" by A.I. Medvedeva and M.V. Kholod, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that two datasets were collected: one using computerized perimetry for glaucoma diagnosis and another from a Russian-Swiss experiment using Tobii Pro Glasses 3 on VR video. This gives me a clear starting point.

Next, I will look for specific details about these datasets in the **methods** or **experiments** sections. In the introduction, the authors mention the first dataset is related to computerized perimetry for visual field analysis, while the second dataset involves eye movement data collected during a VR experience. I need to find more detailed descriptions of these datasets.

In the **section 1 (Research on Visual Field Analysis)**, the authors describe the first dataset collected through computerized perimetry, which is used to visualize the human visual field and diagnose glaucoma. However, they do not provide a specific name for this dataset. I will note that it is related to glaucoma diagnosis.

In **section 2 (Eye Movement Data Collection)**, the authors detail the second dataset collected using Tobii Pro Glasses 3 during a VR video experiment. They mention that the data includes eye movement metrics such as fixation points and saccades, but again, no specific dataset name is provided.

Now, I will check the **References section** for citations related to the datasets. The authors reference several works that may provide context or foundational data for their experiments:

1. For the computerized perimetry dataset, I will cite:
   > Симакова, И.Л., Сухинин М.В. Сравнительный анализ эффективности некоторых методов компьютерной периметрии в диагностике глаукомы // «Глаукома: теория и практика»: сборник научных трудов конф. – 2012. –№ 7. – С. 198 – 203.

2. For the eye movement data collected using Tobii Pro Glasses 3, I will cite:
   > Duchowski, A. T., Shivashankaraiah, V., Rawls, T., Gramopadhye, A. K., Melloy, B. J., & Kanki, B. Binocular eye tracking in virtual reality for inspection training. In Proceedings of the 2000 symposium on Eye tracking research & applications, 2000, pp. 89 – 96.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets and their relevant citations for any future use or analysis.
