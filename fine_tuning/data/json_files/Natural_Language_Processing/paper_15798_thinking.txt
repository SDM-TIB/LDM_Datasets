To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Reaction-diffusion equations in mathematical models arising in epidemiology" by Vasyl Davydovych, Vasyl Dutka, and Roman Cherniha, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections that discuss models and experiments** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a general overview, but I will focus on the introduction and subsequent sections for specific mentions of datasets.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss various mathematical models used for epidemic processes, but they do not explicitly mention datasets. I will need to look for sections that detail specific models or experiments, as these are likely to reference datasets.

Next, I will examine **section 3 (Classical epidemic models with diffusion in space)** and **section 4 (Other epidemic models taking into account spatial heterogeneity)**. These sections may contain references to datasets used for simulations or model validation. If the authors mention any specific datasets or sources of data, I will note them down.

I will also check the **conclusions and references** sections to see if any datasets are cited or if there are references to studies that include datasets. The references may provide additional context or direct citations for datasets used in the models discussed.

If I find any datasets mentioned, I will ensure to extract the full citation for each dataset. For example, if the authors refer to a dataset from a specific study, I will look for the corresponding reference in the bibliography to obtain the complete citation.

Once I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset along with its full citation. This will ensure that the datasets are properly documented for future reference or analysis.

In summary, my approach will involve:
1. Reading the abstract, introduction, and relevant sections for mentions of datasets.
2. Noting any datasets and their descriptions.
3. Checking the references for full citations of the datasets.
4. Compiling the information into a clear format for documentation.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and cite the datasets referenced in the paper.
