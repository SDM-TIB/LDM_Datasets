To extract datasets from the research paper titled "kk2018 at SemEval-2020 Task 9: Adversarial Training for Code-Mixing Sentiment Classification" by Jiaxiang Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors achieved first place in a sentiment classification competition, which suggests that they likely used specific datasets for their experiments.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of code-mixing and the lack of data in this area. They mention the use of a code-mixing dataset but do not specify its name yet. This prompts me to look further into the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**. Here, the authors state that there are **14,000 training examples, 3,000 development examples, and 3,000 test examples**. They refer to a dataset used for training but again do not provide a specific name. However, they do reference the work of Patwa et al. (2020) for more detailed dataset information, which is a crucial lead.

I will then check the **references section** to find the full citation for the work of Patwa et al. (2020) since it likely contains the dataset details. The citation is:
> Parth Patwa, Gustavo Aguilar, Sudipta Kar, Suraj Pandey, Srinivas PYKL, Björn Gambäck, Tanmoy Chakraborty, Thamar Solorio, and Amitava Das. *SemEval-2020 Task 9: Overview of Sentiment Analysis of Code-Mixed Tweets*. In Proceedings of the 14th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval-2020), Barcelona, Spain, December. Association for Computational Linguistics.

This citation indicates that the dataset used for the experiments is related to the SemEval-2020 Task 9, which focuses on sentiment analysis of code-mixed tweets.

Now, I will summarize the findings regarding the dataset:

1. **Code-Mixed Dataset**: The paper discusses a code-mixed dataset used for sentiment classification, specifically for Hindi-English code-mixing. The details of this dataset can be found in the work of Patwa et al. (2020).

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citation for the dataset as it is critical for proper attribution and further research.

In conclusion, I have identified the relevant dataset and its citation, which will be included in the structured output for further processing.
