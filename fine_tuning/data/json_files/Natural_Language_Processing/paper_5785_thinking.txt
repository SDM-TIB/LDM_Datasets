To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Model Stability with Continuous Data Updates" by Huiting Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on model stability and mentions experiments on various text classification tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will examine **section 4 (Tasks)**, where the authors summarize the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they list several datasets along with their characteristics, such as the number of training and testing examples, the number of classes, and example inputs and outputs. The datasets mentioned include:

1. **Consumer Complaints Dataset (CCD)**: This dataset contains 59,583 training examples and 6,681 testing examples, with 11 classes.
2. **IJCNLP Customer Feedback Dataset**: This dataset has 3,037 training examples and 500 testing examples.
3. **Stack Overflow Dataset**: This dataset includes 35,676 training examples and 4,000 testing examples, with 6 classes.
4. **Reuters-21578 Dataset**: This dataset consists of 6,999 training examples and 2,742 testing examples, with 77 classes.
5. **ATIS Dataset**: This dataset has 4,978 training examples and 893 testing examples, with 21 classes.
6. **SNIPS Dataset**: This dataset contains 13,784 training examples and 700 testing examples, with 7 classes.

In the **References section**, I will look for full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its full citation, ready for further processing or review.
