To extract datasets from the research paper titled "State Anti-windup: A New Methodology for Tackling State Constraints at Both Synthesis and Implementation Levels" by Amir H. Abolmasoumi and Bogdan Marinescu, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview, and the introduction often highlights the significance of the research, including any datasets used.

Next, I will look for specific sections that typically contain dataset information, such as **section 6 (Simulation Results)**, where the authors discuss the effectiveness of their proposed methods. This section often includes details about the datasets used for simulations or experiments.

In the **simulation results**, the authors mention two distinct systems: a mathematical second-order system and an industrial application involving a grid-connected inverter-based resource. I will note any datasets or simulation parameters they provide.

I will also check the **references section** for any citations related to datasets. If the authors refer to existing datasets, I will ensure to capture the full citations for those datasets.

For example, if they mention using a specific dataset for simulations, I will extract the name of that dataset and its citation. If they refer to any standard datasets in the field, I will look up their full citations as well.

Once I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation.

Finally, I will summarize the findings, ensuring that I have accurately captured all relevant datasets and their citations from the paper.
