To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Corpus Considerations for Annotator Modeling and Scaling" by Olufunke O. Sarumi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract provides a general overview, but the methodology section is likely to contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used.

In **section 3 (Datasets)**, the authors explicitly list seven datasets used in their study. I will carefully note the names and descriptions of each dataset:

1. **Gab Hate Speech Corpus (GHC)**: This dataset consists of 27,665 social media posts from Gab.com, annotated by at least three annotators, focusing on hate speech detection.

2. **GoEmotions**: This dataset contains 58,012 English Reddit comments labeled for 27 emotion categories, focusing on six Ekman emotions.

3. **HS-Brexit**: A dataset of 1,120 tweets related to Brexit and immigration, annotated for hate speech, aggressiveness, and offensiveness by two groups of annotators.

4. **ConvAbuse**: This dataset includes approximately 4,000 English dialogues annotated for abuse presence, severity, and directness.

5. **Multi-Domain Agreement (MD)**: Comprising 10,753 tweets from three domains, this dataset is annotated for offensiveness by a group of five annotators.

6. **Arabic Misogyny and Sexism (ArMIS)**: This dataset contains over 900 Arabic tweets annotated for misogyny and sexism, focusing on varying perspectives of annotators.

7. **Social Chemistry (SoC)**: Sourced from Reddit, this dataset includes posts and comments from the /r/amitheasshole subreddit, with 21,000 posts and 327,000 verdicts.

Next, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. Here are the citations I will extract:

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
