To extract datasets from the research paper titled "AnonPSI: An Anonymity Assessment Framework for PSI" by Bo Jiang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted a comprehensive performance evaluation using **two real datasets**. This indicates that datasets are indeed present in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically looking for any detailed descriptions of the datasets used. The authors state that they evaluated their algorithms using two real-world datasets: **COVID-19 dataset of tested individuals in Israel** and **Taobaoâ€™s dataset of ad display/click records**. I will note down the key details provided about each dataset.

1. **COVID-19 Dataset**: This dataset was collected by the Israel Ministry of Health and includes **255,668 distinct individuals** who were tested for COVID-19 from **March 22, 2020, to April 30, 2020**. The dataset is used for leakage quantification in COVID-19 contact tracing.

2. **Taobao Dataset**: This dataset consists of **25,029,435 ad display/click records** concerning **827,009 ads and 1,061,768 individuals**. It was collected from **May 6, 2017, to May 14, 2017**, and is used for leakage quantification to measure ad conversion revenue.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

- For the **COVID-19 dataset**, the citation is:
  > Machine learning-based prediction of covid-19 diagnosis based on symptoms. URL: https://github.com/nshomron/covidpred.

- For the **Taobao dataset**, the citation is:
  > Taobao display advertisement click-through rate prediction dataset. URL: https://tianchi.aliyun.com/dataset/datadetail?dataid=56, 2018.

With this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture the necessary details about the datasets used in the research paper.
