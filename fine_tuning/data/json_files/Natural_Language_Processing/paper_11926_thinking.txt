To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Mitigating Bias: Enhancing Image Classification by Improving Model Explanations" by Raha Ahmadi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experimentation on benchmark datasets, which indicates that datasets are likely discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, I find that the authors specifically mention using the **RIVAL10 dataset** in section 4.1. I will read this section carefully to gather details about the dataset, including its structure, number of images, categories, and any relevant characteristics.

In section 4.1, the authors describe the **RIVAL10 dataset** as follows:
- It consists of images from 20 categories of ImageNet-1k, totaling 26,000 high-resolution images organized into 10 classes that match those of CIFAR10.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the RIVAL10 dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:
> Mazda Moayeri, Phillip Pope, Yogesh Balaji, and Soheil Feizi. *A comprehensive study of image classification model sensitivity to foregrounds, backgrounds, and visual attributes*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 19087â€“19097, 2022.

With this information, I have successfully identified the dataset used in the research and its full citation.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format for clarity and future reference. This includes the dataset name, description, and citation, ensuring that all details are accurately captured for any potential downstream processing or review.
