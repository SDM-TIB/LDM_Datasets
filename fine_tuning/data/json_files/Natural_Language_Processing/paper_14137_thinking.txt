To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Are Deep Learning Classification Results Obtained on CT Scans Fair and Interpretable?" by Mohamad M.A. Ashames et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant dataset information along with their full citations.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of deep learning methods for classification of lung nodules from CT scans, which suggests that there may be datasets involved. The introduction further discusses the importance of dataset separation in training and testing, indicating that specific datasets may be referenced.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **materials and methods** section. In this paper, the authors specifically mention the **LIDC/IDRI dataset** as the primary dataset used for their experiments. I will note the details provided about this dataset, including its size, the number of patients, and the nature of the data it contains.

In the **materials and methods section**, the authors describe the LIDC/IDRI dataset in detail, stating that it contains 1018 thoracic CT scans from 1010 different patients, along with XML files containing diagnosis and nodule reports from radiologists. This information is crucial for understanding the dataset's context and usage.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the LIDC/IDRI dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:

> Armato III SG, McLennan G, Bidaut L, McNitt-Gray MF, Meyer CR, Reeves AP, Zhao B, Aberle DR, Henschke CI, Hoffman EA, Kazerooni EA. *The lung image database consortium (LIDC) and image database resource initiative (IDRI): a completed reference database of lung nodules on CT scans*. Medical physics. 38(2):915-31, 2011.

Since the paper primarily focuses on the LIDC/IDRI dataset, I will ensure that this dataset is the only one I extract and describe.

Finally, I will compile the extracted dataset information, including its description and full citation, into a structured format for further use or analysis. This will ensure that all relevant details are captured accurately and can be referenced appropriately in future work.
