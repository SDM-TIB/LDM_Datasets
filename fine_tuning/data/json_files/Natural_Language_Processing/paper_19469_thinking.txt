To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Usage-centric Take on Intent Understanding in E-Commerce" by Wendi Zhou et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the introduction of a **Product Recovery Benchmark** and an **example dataset**, which indicates that there are datasets to be extracted.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors discuss the weaknesses of the FolkScope knowledge graph and the need for a new benchmark. They mention that they will release their code and datasets, which suggests that there are specific datasets related to their research.

In the **Product Recovery Benchmark section (Section 4)**, the authors describe the benchmark and state that it is based on the **Amazon Reviews Dataset (ARD)**. This is a clear indication of a dataset that is being utilized in their research.

I will also look for any additional datasets mentioned in the **experiments and results sections**. However, the primary dataset referenced is the Amazon Reviews Dataset, which is used to validate the weaknesses identified in the FolkScope knowledge graph.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to gather the full citation for the Amazon Reviews Dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:

- **Amazon Reviews Dataset (ARD)**: 
  > Jianmo Ni, Jiacheng Li, and Julian McAuley. *Justifying Recommendations using Distantly-Labeled Reviews and Fine-Grained Aspects*. In Proceedings of the 2019 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing and the 9th International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing (EMNLP-IJCNLP), pages 188â€“197, Hong Kong, China. Association for Computational Linguistics, 2019.

Since the authors mention that they will release their own dataset based on the ARD, I will note that while the paper does not provide a specific name for this new dataset, it is implied that it is derived from the ARD.

In summary, the key dataset extracted from the paper is:

1. **Amazon Reviews Dataset (ARD)**: This dataset is crucial for the experiments and is used to validate the proposed Product Recovery Benchmark.

Now, I will compile the dataset entry with the full citation into a structured format for further processing.
