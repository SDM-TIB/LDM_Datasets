To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CodeScope: An Execution-based Multilingual Multitask Multidimensional Benchmark for Evaluating LLMs on Code Understanding and Generation" by Weixiang Yan et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract highlights the introduction of CodeScope as a benchmark for evaluating LLM capabilities, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly the subsections that describe the datasets used for evaluation. I will look for specific mentions of datasets, their characteristics, and how they are utilized in the experiments. 

In the **CodeScope Benchmark section**, the authors describe various tasks and the datasets associated with them. I will note the following datasets:

1. **Code Summarization Dataset**: This dataset is collected from the Rosetta Code website, covering 43 programming languages. It includes 4,838 code samples and is designed to evaluate the ability of models to summarize code functionality.

2. **Code Smell Dataset**: This dataset integrates Java and C# code smells identified from industry-relevant projects, covering various categories of code smells.

3. **Code Review Dataset**: This dataset is based on real-world code changes from GitHub, covering multiple programming languages and designed to evaluate code review capabilities.

4. **Automated Testing Dataset**: This dataset consists of samples from four programming languages (Python, Java, C, and C++) sourced from Codeforces, including problem descriptions and corresponding test cases.

5. **Program Synthesis Dataset**: This dataset includes problem descriptions and correct submissions across 14 programming languages, focusing on the ability to generate code from natural language descriptions.

6. **Code Translation Dataset**: This dataset is derived from the Program Synthesis dataset and is used to evaluate the translation of code between different programming languages.

7. **Code Repair Dataset**: This dataset expands on the Program Synthesis dataset by including incorrect code submissions and their corresponding error information.

8. **Code Optimization Dataset**: This dataset is constructed from problem samples that exhibit optimization potential based on execution time and memory usage.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations related to these datasets. For example, the Code Summarization dataset references the Rosetta Code website, while the Code Smell dataset references works by Madeyski and Lewowski (2023) and Slivka et al. (2023).

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required.

Now, I will prepare the structured output for each dataset, ensuring that all necessary details are included for clarity and completeness.
