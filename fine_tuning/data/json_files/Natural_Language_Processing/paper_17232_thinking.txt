To extract datasets from the research paper titled "USTHB at NADI 2023 shared task: Exploring Preprocessing and Feature Engineering Strategies for Arabic Dialect Identification" by Mohamed Lichouri et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and dataset description sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the paper focuses on Arabic dialect identification, which suggests that there may be datasets related to this task.

In the **introduction**, the authors reference several previous works and shared tasks related to Arabic dialect identification, specifically mentioning NADI 2019, NADI 2020, NADI 2021, and NADI 2022. However, I need to find specific datasets used in their experiments.

Next, I will examine **section 2 (Description of the Dataset)**, where the authors provide details about the dataset used in their study. They mention that the dataset consists of **23.4K tweets from 18 Arab countries**, divided into three subsets: Closed Country-level Dialect Identification, Closed Dialect to MSA MT, and Open Dialect to MSA MT. This section provides a clear indication of the dataset's structure and purpose.

The authors also provide statistics about the dataset in **Table 1**, which includes information about the number of sentences, words, and other relevant metrics for the training, development, and test sets. This confirms the dataset's relevance and usage in their experiments.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The authors refer to previous NADI shared tasks, which are likely the sources of the datasets they used. I will extract the citations for these tasks:

1. For **NADI 2019**, the citation is:
   > Mourad Abbas, Mohamed Lichouri, and Abed Alhakim Freihat. 2019. St madar 2019 shared task: Arabic fine-grained dialect identification. In Proceedings of the Fourth Arabic Natural Language Processing Workshop, pages 269–273.

2. For **NADI 2020**, the citation is:
   > Muhammad Abdul-Mageed, Chiyu Zhang, Houda Bouamor, and Nizar Habash. 2020. Nadi 2020: The first nuanced arabic dialect identification shared task. arXiv preprint arXiv:2010.11334.

3. For **NADI 2021**, the citation is:
   > Muhammad Abdul-Mageed, Chiyu Zhang, AbdelRahim Elmadany, Houda Bouamor, and Nizar Habash. 2021. NADI 2021: The second nuanced Arabic dialect identification shared task. In Proceedings of the Sixth Arabic Natural Language Processing Workshop, pages 244–259, Kyiv, Ukraine (Virtual).

4. For **NADI 2022**, the citation is:
   > Muhammad Abdul-Mageed, Chiyu Zhang, AbdelRahim Elmadany, Houda Bouamor, and Nizar Habash. 2022. NADI 2022: The third nuanced Arabic dialect identification shared task. In Proceedings of the The Seventh Arabic Natural Language Processing Workshop (WANLP), pages 85–97, Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates (Hybrid). Association for Computational Linguistics.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. Each dataset will be described with its purpose, size, and relevant citations to ensure proper attribution.
