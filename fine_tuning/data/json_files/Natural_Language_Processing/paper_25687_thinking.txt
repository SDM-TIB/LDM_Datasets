To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Graph-Structured Speculative Decoding" by Zhuocheng Gong et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions the application of the proposed method across various large language models (LLMs) and hints at the datasets used for evaluation. This suggests that datasets are likely discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **experiments**. In this paper, it appears that the datasets are mentioned in **section 6 (Experiments)**. Here, the authors explicitly list the datasets they evaluated their method on, which include:

1. **GSM8K**: A dataset for solving math word problems.
2. **XSUM**: A dataset for extreme summarization tasks.
3. **Alpaca**: A dataset for instruction-following tasks.
4. **WMT-14 (En-De)**: A dataset for machine translation tasks.

I will also check the **results section** to confirm how these datasets were utilized in the experiments and to gather any additional details that may be relevant for the dataset descriptions.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and will provide context for each dataset's origin and purpose.

For the datasets mentioned, I will compile the following citations:

- **GSM8K**: 
  > Karl Cobbe, Vineet Kosaraju, Mohammad Bavarian, Mark Chen, Heewoo Jun, Lukasz Kaiser, Matthias Plappert, Jerry Tworek, Jacob Hilton, Reiichiro Nakano, Christopher Hesse, and John Schulman. *Training verifiers to solve math word problems*. CoRR, abs/2110.14168, 2021.

- **XSUM**: 
  > Shashi Narayan, Shay B. Cohen, and Mirella Lapata. *Don’t give me the details, just the summary! Topic-aware convolutional neural networks for extreme summarization*. In Proceedings of the 2018 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 1797–1807, 2018.

- **Alpaca**: 
  > Rohan Taori, Ishaan Gulrajani, Tianyi Zhang, Yann Dubois, Xuechen Li, Carlos Guestrin, Percy Liang, and Tatsunori B. Hashimoto. *Stanford Alpaca: An instruction-following LLaMA model*. https://github.com/tatsu-lab/stanford_alpaca, 2023.

- **WMT-14 (En-De)**: 
  > Ondrej Bojar et al. *Findings of the 2014 workshop on statistical machine translation*. In Proceedings of the Ninth Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation, pages 12–58, 2014.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will prepare to format this information according to the required structure for downstream processing or review.
