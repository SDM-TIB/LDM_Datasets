To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ASY-VRNet: Waterway Panoptic Driving Perception Model based on Asymmetric Fair Fusion of Vision and 4D mmWave Radar" by Runwei Guan et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors achieved state-of-the-art performance on the **WaterScenes benchmark**, which suggests that this dataset is crucial for their evaluation.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this section, the authors state that they trained and evaluated ASY-VRNet on the **WaterScenes dataset**, which includes 54,120 frames across seven categories in various waterway scenarios. This is a clear identification of a dataset used in their research.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the WaterScenes dataset. The relevant citation is:
> S. Yao, R. Guan, Z. Wu, Y. Ni, Z. Huang, R. W. Liu, Y. Yue, W. Ding, E. G. Lim, H. Seo, et al. "Waterscenes: A multi-task 4d radar-camera fusion dataset and benchmarks for autonomous driving on water surfaces." *IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems*, 2024.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the findings:

1. **WaterScenes Dataset**: This dataset is used for training and evaluating the ASY-VRNet model. It consists of 54,120 frames and includes seven categories relevant to waterway scenarios.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that the full citation for the dataset is included.
