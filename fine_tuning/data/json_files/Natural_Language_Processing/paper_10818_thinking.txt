To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Automating the Analysis of Institutional Design in International Agreements" by Anna WrÃ³blewska et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly referenced. The abstract mentions the use of a prototype tool tested against the **2003 UNESCO Convention for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage**, which suggests that this document is central to the research but does not indicate a dataset in the traditional sense.

Next, I will examine the **methodology section** for any mention of data sources or datasets used in the analysis. The authors describe their tool's workflow, which includes scraping legal documents and using Institutional Grammar (IG) for analysis. However, they primarily focus on the **2003 UNESCO Convention** as the main document analyzed, rather than a dataset in the conventional sense.

In the **results and discussion sections**, I will look for any references to datasets or data collections that might have been used to validate their findings or compare results. The authors discuss the analysis of the **2003 UNESCO Convention** and its implications for understanding institutional design, but again, they do not mention additional datasets.

Finally, I will check the **references section** for any cited datasets or related works that might provide further context. The references primarily consist of academic papers and articles related to Institutional Grammar and network analysis, but they do not specifically cite datasets.

Based on this thorough review, it appears that the primary focus of the paper is on the **2003 UNESCO Convention** rather than on multiple datasets. Therefore, I will document this single source as the main dataset used in their analysis.

The full citation for the **2003 UNESCO Convention** is:
> United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). *Convention for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage*. Paris, 2003.

I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and future reference.
