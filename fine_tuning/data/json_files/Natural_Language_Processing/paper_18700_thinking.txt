To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Low-rank Attention Side-Tuning for Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning" by Ningyuan Tang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the **VTAB-1K** benchmark, which indicates that this dataset is likely to be important.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. In section 5.2, the authors describe the **VTAB-1K** dataset in detail, stating that it is a collection of visual adaptation tasks designed to assess the transferability of pretrained models. They mention that it encompasses 19 datasets categorized into Natural, Specialized, and Structured groups, with each dataset including 800 training images and 200 validation images.

Additionally, in section 5.3, the authors evaluate their method on five fine-grained visual classification (FGVC) datasets: **CUB-200-2011**, **NABirds**, **Oxford Flowers**, **Stanford Dogs**, and **Stanford Cars**. This confirms that these datasets are also utilized in their experiments.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper from the **References section**:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its full citation for clarity and completeness.
