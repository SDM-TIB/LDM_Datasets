To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Domain-Guided Masked Autoencoders for Unique Player Identification" by Bavesh Balaji et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on three large-scale sports datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically section IV, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, they mention three datasets:

1. **SoccerNet**: This dataset is described as the largest open-source jersey number dataset, comprising 4,064 player tracklets, with a clear structure for training, validation, testing, and challenge sets.

2. **Baseball Dataset**: This dataset is curated from baseball videos, consisting of 150 player tracklets sampled from over 1,000 videos, with jersey number labels assigned to each tracklet.

3. **Ice Hockey Dataset**: This dataset consists of 3,510 player tracklets generated from 84 NHL videos, specifically designed to evaluate the model's performance in a fast-paced environment.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, facilitating further exploration and validation of the findings presented in the paper.
