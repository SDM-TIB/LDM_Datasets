To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Unveiling Disparities in Maternity Care: A Topic Modelling Approach to Analysing Maternity Incident Investigation Reports" by Georgina Cosma et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study analyzes **anonymised maternity incident investigation reports** provided by the Healthcare Safety Investigation Branch (HSIB), which suggests that this is the primary dataset used.

Next, I will focus on **section 2.1 (Dataset of maternity incident investigation reports)**, where the authors describe the dataset in detail. They mention that the dataset consists of **188 anonymised investigation reports** written between 2019 and 2022, with specific details about the number of reports per year and the inclusion of ethnicity data for some reports. This section confirms the dataset's relevance and provides context for its use in the study.

In the **methodology section**, the authors describe how the dataset was processed and annotated using the Safety Intelligence Research (SIRch) taxonomy, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's structure and purpose. They also mention that the output was compiled into a **CSV file**, which is important for any future reference or analysis.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The authors reference the HSIB Maternity Investigation Programme Year in Review 2022/23, which provides an overview of the program's activities and findings. The citation for this report is:

- **HSIB Maternity Investigation Programme Year in Review 2022/23**: Healthcare Safety Investigation Branch. *Maternity Investigation Programme Year in Review 2022/23*. Available at: https://www.mnsi.org.uk/news/maternity-investigation-programme-year-in-review-202223/ (Accessed: 6th June 2024).

Additionally, the authors reference the I-SIRch tool, which is used for concept annotation. The citation for this tool is:

- **Singh, M.K., Cosma, G., Waterson, P., Back, J., Jun, G.T.**: I-SIRch: AI-powered Concept Annotation Tool for Equitable Extraction and Analysis of Safety Insights from Maternity Investigations. Under Review (2023). Preprint available: https://github.com/gcosma/I-SIRchpapers.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and that the full citations are included for reference. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
