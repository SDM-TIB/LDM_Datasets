To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Scaling Laws for Discriminative Speech Recognition Rescoring Models" by Yile Gu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, experimental setup, and results sections** to find any references to datasets. The abstract discusses the use of a rescoring model and mentions the importance of training data, which suggests that datasets are involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the need for second-pass rescoring in automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems and reference various studies. However, I need to look for specific datasets used in their experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental setup section**. Here, the authors mention that they utilize internal datasets consisting of de-identified user interactions with a conversational agent in English. They specify that the training, development, and test splits contain 95,300, 30, and 10 utterances, respectively. This indicates that they are using a proprietary dataset for their experiments.

I will also check the **results section** to see if there are any additional details about the datasets or their characteristics. However, it appears that the authors primarily rely on their internal dataset for the experiments, and they mention that there is no readily available public speech data at this large size.

Since the authors do not provide a specific name for their internal dataset, I will note that it is an internal dataset used for training and evaluation in their study. I will also mention that they refer to the original RescoreBERT paper for the model architecture and training details.

Finally, I will compile the information I have gathered and ensure that I provide a full citation for the RescoreBERT paper, as it is relevant to the dataset used in this research.

The citation for the RescoreBERT paper is:
> L. Xu, Y. Gu, J. Kolehmainen, H. Khan, A. Gandhe, A. Rastrow, A. Stolcke, and I. Bulyko. "RescoreBERT: Discriminative speech recognition rescoring with BERT." In ICASSP 2022-2022 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP), pp. 6117â€“6121, 2022.

Now, I will summarize the dataset information and prepare it for structured output.
