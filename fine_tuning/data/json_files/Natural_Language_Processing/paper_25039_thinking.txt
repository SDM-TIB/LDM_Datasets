To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Sinkhorn algorithms and linear programming solvers for optimal partial transport problems" by Yikun Bai, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions, and the introduction typically outlines the context and significance of the research. I will look for any mentions of datasets or references to data used in the experiments.

Next, I will examine the **methodology** and **experiments** sections. These sections often contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used, including their names, sizes, and any specific characteristics that are relevant to the research. I will pay close attention to any tables or figures that might summarize the datasets.

If the paper includes a **datasets** section, I will focus on that as it is likely to provide explicit details about the datasets used in the study. I will note down the names of the datasets, their descriptions, and any relevant statistics or metrics provided by the authors.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial as it allows for proper attribution and enables others to locate the datasets easily. I will ensure to capture the authors, title, publication venue, and year for each dataset.

If the paper mentions any datasets that are not original but are derived from other works, I will trace back to the original sources and provide their citations as well.

Finally, I will compile all the extracted information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset entry includes its name, description, and full citation. This will facilitate easy access and understanding of the datasets used in the research.

By following these steps, I will ensure a thorough and accurate extraction of datasets from the paper, complete with proper citations.
