To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Enhancing Wildfire Forecasting Through Multisource Spatio-Temporal Data, Deep Learning, Ensemble Models and Transfer Learning" by Ayoub Jadouli and Chaker El Amrani, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract discusses the integration of multisource spatiotemporal data, including satellite data, which suggests that datasets are involved, but I need to find specific names and details.

Next, I will examine the **methodology section**, particularly **section 3 (Methodology)**, where the authors describe their data sources. They mention using **satellite imagery, weather data, human activity data, and ground truth data**. I will look for any specific datasets or sources that are cited or referenced.

In **section 3.1 (Data Sources)**, the authors specify that they source satellite data from platforms like **Sentinel** and **MODIS**. This indicates that these platforms provide datasets relevant to their study.

I will also check the **results and discussion sections** to see if the authors provide any additional context or details about the datasets used, particularly in terms of their application in the experiments.

Finally, I will consult the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The citations for the satellite data sources are as follows:

- For **MODIS**, the citation is:
  > Giglio, L., Descloitres, J., Justice, C. O., & Kaufman, Y. J. (2003). An enhanced contextual fire detection algorithm for MODIS. *Remote sensing of Environment*, 87(2-3), 273-282.

- For **Sentinel**, the citation is:
  > European Space Agency. (2015). Sentinel-1: A new space mission for the Copernicus program. *ESA Bulletin*, 162, 8-17.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
