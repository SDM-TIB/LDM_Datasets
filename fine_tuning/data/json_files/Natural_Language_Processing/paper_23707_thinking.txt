To extract datasets from the research paper titled "HDMba: Hyperspectral Remote Sensing Imagery Dehazing with State Space Model" by Hang Fu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on the **Gaofen-5 HSI dataset**, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental results section** where the authors provide details about the datasets used. In this section, they mention two specific datasets:

1. **HyperDehazing Dataset**: This dataset is synthesized based on the Dark Object Subtraction (DOS) model using 100 clean scenes with 20 different haze thicknesses and 5 haze abundances. It contains a total of 2000 hazy and haze-free image pairs, each with dimensions of 512×512×305.

2. **HDD (Hyperspectral Defogging Dataset)**: This dataset comprises 20 reference-free hazy images, each also with dimensions of 512×512×305. All images in this dataset were used for network testing.

To ensure I have the correct citations, I will check the **References section** of the paper for any relevant citations related to these datasets. However, the paper does not provide specific citations for the datasets themselves, as they appear to be original contributions of the authors.

Since the **HyperDehazing Dataset** is mentioned to be publicly available at a GitHub repository, I will note that down as part of the dataset description.

Now, I will compile the information about each dataset, ensuring to include the details and any relevant links or citations as needed.

1. **HyperDehazing Dataset**:
   - Description: Synthesized dataset based on the DOS model using 100 clean scenes with 20 different haze thicknesses and 5 haze abundances. Contains 2000 hazy and haze-free image pairs, each sized 512×512×305.
   - Citation: Available at [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/RsAI-lab/HyperDehazing).

2. **HDD (Hyperspectral Defogging Dataset)**:
   - Description: Comprises 20 reference-free hazy images, each with dimensions of 512×512×305, used for network testing.
   - Citation: No specific citation provided in the paper.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare to format it according to the required structure for datasets, ensuring that each entry is clear and includes the necessary details for future reference or processing.
