To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Estimating Propensity for Causality-based Recommendation without Exposure Data" by Zhongzhou Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention key datasets used for evaluation. 

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experiment)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, the authors mention three datasets:

1. **DH_original**: This dataset is derived from the DunnHumby dataset, which includes purchase and promotion logs at a physical retailer over a 93-week period. The authors note that this dataset is used to evaluate their proposed method.

2. **DH_personalized**: This is another version of the DunnHumby dataset, which differs in the derivation of ground-truth propensity scores. It incorporates a simulated personalization factor.

3. **MovieLens 100K (ML)**: This dataset includes users' ratings on movies and simulated propensity scores based on the ratings and user behaviors.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

- For **DunnHumby datasets**, the citation is:
  > Sato, M., Singh, J., Takemori, S., & Ohkuma, T. (2020). Unbiased learning for the causal effect of recommendation. In *Proceedings of the ACM Conference on Recommender Systems* (RecSys), pages 378â€“387.

- For **MovieLens 100K**, the citation is:
  > Harper, F. M., & Konstan, J. A. (2009). The MovieLens Datasets: History and Context. *ACM SIGKDD Explorations Newsletter*, 5(1), 1-10.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant information regarding the datasets used in the research paper.
