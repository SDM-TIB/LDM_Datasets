To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Toward Motion Robustness: A masked attention regularization framework in remote photoplethysmography" by Pengfei Zhao et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on three benchmark datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used in their experiments. In this section, they mention:

1. **PURE Dataset**: This dataset consists of 60 facial videos from 10 participants, recorded under various head movements. The videos were captured at a resolution of 640 x 480 pixels and a frame rate of 30 FPS, with ground truth PPG signals collected using a finger clip pulse oximeter.

2. **UBFC-rPPG Dataset**: This dataset includes 42 high-quality facial videos, each featuring simultaneous recordings of PPG signals and heart rates. The videos are also at a resolution of 640 x 480 pixels and a frame rate of 30 FPS.

3. **MMPD Dataset**: The Multi-domain Mobile Video Physiology Dataset contains 11 hours of recordings from 33 participants, captured at 30 FPS and originally at 1280 x 720 pixels, later scaled down to 320 x 240 pixels. It includes various lighting conditions and activities, with accompanying PPG signals downsampled to match the video frame rate.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **PURE Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Ronny Stricker, Steffen Muller, and Horst-Michael Gross. *Non-contact video-based pulse rate measurement on a mobile service robot*. The 23rd IEEE International Symposium on Robot and Human Interactive Communication, pages 1056–1062, 2014.

- For the **UBFC-rPPG Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Richard Macwan, Yannick Benezeth, and Alamin Mansouri. *Heart rate estimation using remote photoplethysmography with multi-objective optimization*. Biomedical Signal Processing and Control, 49:24–33, 2019.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
