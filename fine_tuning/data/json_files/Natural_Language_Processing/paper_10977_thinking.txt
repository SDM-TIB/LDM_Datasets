To extract datasets from the research paper titled "GaitGS: Temporal Feature Learning in Granularity and Span Dimension for Gait Recognition" by Haijun Xiong et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors conducted extensive experiments on three popular gait datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used. In **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, they list three datasets:

1. **CASIA-B**: This dataset includes cross-view and multi-walking condition sequences of 124 subjects, with three walking conditions: normal walking, walking with bags, and walking in coats. The authors mention that they adopt a specific training strategy for this dataset.

2. **GREW**: This is a large outdoor gait dataset with 128,671 sequences captured by 882 cameras from 26,345 subjects. The dataset is divided into training, validation, and test sets.

3. **OU-MVLP**: This dataset contains cross-view sequences of 10,307 subjects and is divided into two groups with different views. The authors specify the training and testing splits used in their experiments.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **CASIA-B**, the citation is:
  > Yu, S., Tan, D., Tan, T. (2006). A framework for evaluating the effect of view angle, clothing and carrying condition on gait recognition. In Proceedings of the 18th International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR’06), vol. 4, pp. 441–444. IEEE.

- For **GREW**, the citation is:
  > Zhu, Z., Guo, X., Yang, T., Huang, J., Deng, J., Huang, G., Du, D., Lu, J., Zhou, J. (2021). Gait recognition in the wild: A benchmark. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision, pp. 14789–14799.

- For **OU-MVLP**, the citation is:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
