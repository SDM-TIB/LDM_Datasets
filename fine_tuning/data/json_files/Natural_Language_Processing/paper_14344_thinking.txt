To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Knowledge Graphs for the Life Sciences: Recent Developments, Challenges and Opportunities" by Jiaoyan Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections that discuss knowledge graphs and their applications**. The abstract provides a general overview, but I will focus on sections that are likely to mention specific datasets, such as the **Knowledge Graphs in the Life Sciences** section and any sections that discuss use cases or examples.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention the importance of data-driven research in life sciences, which suggests that datasets will be discussed later in the paper. I will pay close attention to any specific datasets mentioned in the context of knowledge graph construction and management.

Next, I will examine **section 2 (Knowledge Graphs in the Life Sciences)**, where the authors describe various types of knowledge graphs and their applications. Here, they mention specific datasets such as:

1. **PharmaGKB**: An integrated online knowledge resource capturing how genetic variation contributes to variation in drug response.
2. **Gene Ontology**: A comprehensive, structured representation of gene function.
3. **UMLS Metathesaurus**: A repository of biomedical vocabularies developed by the US National Library of Medicine.

I will also look for any additional datasets mentioned in **section 3 (Knowledge Graph Construction and Management)** and **section 4 (Life Science Knowledge Discovery)**, where the authors discuss specific projects or use cases that utilize knowledge graphs.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper documentation. For example, the citation for the **Gene Ontology** is:

- The Gene Ontology Consortium. *The Gene Ontology knowledgebase in 2023*. Genetics, 224(1):iyad031, 2023. doi:10.1093/genetics/iyad031.

For **PharmaGKB**, I will look for its citation in the references, which typically includes the authors, title, journal, volume, pages, and year of publication.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture the datasets discussed in the paper and provide proper attribution.
