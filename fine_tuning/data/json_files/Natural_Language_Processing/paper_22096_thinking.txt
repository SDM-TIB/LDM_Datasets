To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Longitudinal Mammogram Risk Prediction" by Batuhan K. Karaman et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract discusses the use of a large-scale dataset for evaluating the proposed model, which indicates that there is a dataset involved.

Next, I will focus on the **Materials and Methods section**, specifically **section 2.1 (Dataset)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset used in their study. Here, they mention the **Karolinska case-control (CSAW-CC) dataset**, which is derived from the Cohort of Screen-Aged Women. The dataset consists of mammograms from women aged 40 to 74 who underwent screenings over multiple years, totaling 19,328 mammograms with 1,413 resulting in a cancer diagnosis.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Karolinska dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:
> Dembrower, K., Lindholm, P., Strand, F. (2019). A multi-million mammography image dataset and population-based screening cohort for the training and evaluation of deep neural networks—the cohort of screen-aged women (CSAW). *Journal of Digital Imaging*, 33, 408–413. https://doi.org/10.1007/s10278-019-00278-0

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets, I will conclude my extraction process here.

Now, I will compile the dataset entry for the **Karolinska case-control dataset** using the required format, ensuring that the full citation is included.

In summary, I have identified one dataset from the paper, and I will prepare the entry accordingly.
