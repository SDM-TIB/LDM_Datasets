To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Outcomes, Assessment, and Evaluation in Educational Recommender Systems: A Systematic Review" by Nursultan Askarbekuly and Ivan LukoviÄ‡, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, results, and discussion sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus, but I need to look for specific datasets in the main body of the paper.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the systematic literature review (SLR) methodology and the papers analyzed, but they do not mention specific datasets yet. I will need to look further into the methodology section.

In **section III (Methodology)**, the authors describe their search strategy and inclusion/exclusion criteria for selecting relevant papers. They mention that they reviewed 1395 papers and filtered them down to 28 relevant studies. However, they do not specify any datasets used in their review process.

Next, I will check **section IV (Results)**, where the authors present the findings of their review. They discuss the educational contexts, supported tasks, and recommendation methods used in the selected papers. They also mention that many studies relied on undisclosed internal datasets, which indicates a lack of publicly available datasets in this field.

In the **discussion section**, the authors reflect on the findings and highlight the gap in available datasets for educational recommender systems. They note that only one study used the **MovieLens dataset**, which is not directly related to education but is a well-known dataset in the recommendation systems domain.

Now, I will compile the information I found regarding datasets:

1. **MovieLens Dataset**: This dataset is mentioned as being used in one of the studies reviewed in the paper. It is a popular dataset for evaluating recommendation algorithms, although it is not specifically designed for educational contexts.

Next, I will look for the full citation of the MovieLens dataset in the references section of the paper. The citation for the MovieLens dataset is:

> J. Bennett and S. Lanning. "The Netflix Prize." In Proceedings of KDD Cup and Workshop, vol. 2007, pp. 35, New York, 2007.

Since the paper primarily discusses the lack of datasets in educational recommender systems and only mentions the MovieLens dataset, I will summarize my findings accordingly.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for the MovieLens dataset, ensuring to include the full citation as required.
