To extract datasets from the research paper titled "COMNet: Co-Occurrent Matching for Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation" by Yukun Su et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the experiments were conducted on the **PASCAL VOC 2012** and **MS-COCO** datasets, which indicates that these datasets are crucial for the research.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (Section IV) to gather more details about these datasets. In this section, the authors provide specific information about the datasets used for evaluation. They mention that the PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset has 1464 images for training, 1449 for validation, and 1456 for testing, and that they also used an augmented training set with 10,582 images. For the MS-COCO dataset, they note that it contains 80 semantic classes and has a default split of 80,000 images for training and 40,000 for validation.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are essential for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

1. For the **PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset**, the citation is:
   > M. Everingham, S. A. Eslami, L. Van Gool, C. K. Williams, J. Winn, and A. Zisserman. "The pascal visual object classes challenge: A retrospective." *International Journal of Computer Vision*, vol. 111, no. 1, pp. 98–136, 2015.

2. For the **MS-COCO dataset**, the citation is:
   > T.-Y. Lin, M. Maire, S. Belongie, J. Hays, P. Perona, D. Ramanan, P. Dollár, and C. L. Zitnick. "Microsoft coco: Common objects in context." In *European Conference on Computer Vision*, Springer, 2014, pp. 740–755.

After gathering all this information, I will summarize the datasets in a clear format, ensuring that each dataset is described with its name, a brief description, and the full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, facilitating further exploration and validation of the findings presented by the authors.
