To extract datasets from the research paper titled "LITE: A Stable Framework for Lattice-Integrated Embedding of Topological Descriptors" by Michael E. Van Huffel and Matteo Palo, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the contributions and may mention datasets used for evaluation or comparison.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any references to datasets, especially in the context of previous work or applications of the proposed methods. The introduction often highlights the significance of the datasets in relation to the research problem.

In the **methodology section**, I will look for any specific datasets used for experiments or evaluations. The authors may describe the datasets in detail, including their characteristics, sizes, and any preprocessing steps taken.

The **results section** may also provide insights into the datasets used, especially if the authors report performance metrics or comparisons across different datasets. This section might include tables or figures summarizing the results obtained on various datasets.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For this paper, I anticipate that the authors may have used datasets related to topological data analysis or benchmark datasets commonly used in machine learning and data analysis. I will specifically look for any mentions of datasets like the Orbit5K dataset or other standard datasets in the field.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for easy reference and further processing.
