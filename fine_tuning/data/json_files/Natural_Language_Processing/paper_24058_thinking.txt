To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Object-Attribute-Relation Representation based Video Semantic Communication" by Qiyuan Du et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on **traffic surveillance video datasets**, which indicates that datasets are involved. This is a good starting point.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors discuss the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they specifically mention using the **UA-DETRAC dataset** for performance validation. I will look for details about this dataset, such as its purpose, size, and any specific characteristics that are relevant to the study.

In the **dataset preparation subsection**, the authors describe how they segmented video frames into a training set and two validation sets with a ratio of 8:1:1. They also mention that validation set val1 shares the same scenes with the training set but features different objects and motions, while validation set val2 comprises distinct scenes from the training set. This information is crucial for understanding how the dataset was utilized in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the UA-DETRAC dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Wen, L., Du, D., Cai, Z., Lei, Z., Chang, M.-C., Qi, H., Lim, J., Yang, M.-H., & Lyu, S. (2020). UA-DETRAC: A new benchmark and protocol for multi-object detection and tracking. *Computer Vision and Image Understanding*, 193, 102907. 

Since the authors did not mention any other datasets in the paper, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format.

I will create an entry for the UA-DETRAC dataset, ensuring to include its full citation and relevant details about its use in the experiments. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the dataset as utilized in the research.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for review or further processing, ensuring that all necessary information is included and accurately represented.
