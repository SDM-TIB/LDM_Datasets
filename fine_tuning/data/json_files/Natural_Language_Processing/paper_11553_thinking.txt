To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MIR-GAN: Refining Frame-Level Modality-Invariant Representations with Adversarial Network for Audio-Visual Speech Recognition" by Yuchen Hu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. In the abstract, the authors mention that their approach is evaluated on two public benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention:

1. **LRS3 Dataset**: This dataset is described as collecting 433 hours of transcribed English videos from TED and TEDx talks, making it the largest publicly available labeled audio-visual speech recognition dataset.

2. **LRS2 Dataset**: This dataset contains 224 hours of video speech from BBC programs, with a total of 144K clips.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **LRS3 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Triantafyllos Afouras, Joon Son Chung, and Andrew Zisserman. *LRS3-TED: A Large-Scale Dataset for Visual Speech Recognition*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1809.00496, 2018.

- For the **LRS2 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Joon Son Chung, Andrew Senior, Oriol Vinyals, and Andrew Zisserman. *Lip Reading Sentences in the Wild*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 3444â€“3453, 2017.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their proper citations.
