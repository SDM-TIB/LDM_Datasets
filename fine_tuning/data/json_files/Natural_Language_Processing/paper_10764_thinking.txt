To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Non-Log-Concave and Nonsmooth Sampling via Langevin Monte Carlo Algorithms" by Tim Tsz-Kit Lau et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study and may mention any datasets used for validation or testing. The introduction typically outlines the context and significance of the research, which may include references to specific datasets.

Next, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments sections**. These sections often detail the experimental setup, including the datasets used for training and evaluation. I will pay close attention to any descriptions of the datasets, such as their names, sizes, and characteristics.

If the paper includes a **results section**, I will check for any references to datasets that were used to obtain the results presented. This could provide additional confirmation of the datasets utilized in the study.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like the "Penn Action Dataset," I would look for its citation in the references, which might look something like this:
> Wenzheng Zhang, Menglong Zhu, and Konstantinos G. Derpanis. *From Actemes to Action: A Strongly-Supervised Representation for Detailed Action Understanding*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 2248â€“2255, 2013.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant datasets from the paper.
