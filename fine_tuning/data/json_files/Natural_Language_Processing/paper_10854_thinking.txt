To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SR-OOD: Out-of-Distribution Detection via Sample Repairing" by Rui Sun et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments on three image datasets: **CIFAR-10**, **CelebA**, and **Pokemon**. This indicates that these datasets are likely central to the research and should be documented.

Next, I will examine the **methodology** and **experiments** sections, as they often provide detailed descriptions of how the datasets were used. In the methodology section, the authors describe their framework and mention the datasets again, confirming their relevance. The experiments section will likely provide additional context on how these datasets were utilized in the experiments.

In the **experiments section**, the authors explicitly state that they evaluated their method on the following datasets:
1. **CIFAR-10**: A well-known dataset consisting of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes.
2. **CelebA**: A large-scale face attributes dataset with over 200,000 celebrity images, each annotated with 40 attribute labels.
3. **Pokemon Dataset**: A dataset that includes data on more than 800 Pokemon from all 7 generations, containing attributes such as name, type, and stats.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to guide readers to the original sources.

- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. *CIFAR-10: Canadian Institute for Advanced Research*. 2009. [Online Available: https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html]

- For **CelebA**, the citation is:
  > Ziwei Liu, Ping Luo, Xiaogang Wang, and Xiaoou Tang. *Deep Learning Face Attributes in the Wild*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 3730-3738, 2015. [Online Available: http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.cn/projects/CelebA.html]

- For **Pokemon Dataset**, the citation is:
  > M. T. Romero. *Complete Pokemon Dataset*, 2022. [Online Available: https://www.pokemon.com/us]

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant datasets and their sources from the paper.
