To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Joint-Dataset Learning and Cross-Consistent Regularization for Text-to-Motion Retrieval" by Nicola Messina et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's focus on text-to-motion retrieval and mentions the use of datasets, which indicates that I should look for specific names.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this paper, they explicitly mention two datasets:

1. **KIT Motion-Language Dataset (KITML)**: This dataset contains 3,911 recordings of full-body motion along with textual descriptions for each motion. The authors note that it has a total of 6,278 annotations in English.

2. **HumanML3D**: This dataset is described as containing 14,616 motions annotated by 44,970 textual descriptions. It is mentioned that this dataset was developed by adding textual annotations to existing motion-capture datasets.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets.

The full citations I will extract are:

- For **KIT Motion-Language Dataset (KITML)**:
  > Matthias Plappert, Christian Mandery, and Tamim Asfour. *The KIT Motion-Language Dataset*. Big Data 4, 4 (2016), 236–252. https://doi.org/10.1089/big.2016.0028

- For **HumanML3D**:
  > Chuan Guo, Xinxin Zuo, Sen Wang, Wei Ji, Xingyu Li, and Li Cheng. *Generating Diverse and Natural 3D Human Motions From Text*. In IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 5152–5161, 2022.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their proper citations.
