To extract datasets from the research paper titled "GaitMotion: A Multitask Dataset for Pathological Gait Forecasting" by Wenwen Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract introduces the GaitMotion dataset, which is designed to capture real-time movement data from patients with pathological gait. This indicates that the dataset is central to the paper's contributions.

Next, I will look for specific details about the dataset in the **Methods** or **Datasets** section, which is likely to provide comprehensive information about the dataset's structure, contents, and intended use. In this paper, the authors describe the GaitMotion dataset in detail, including its composition and the types of data collected (e.g., synchronized accelerometer and gyroscope data, step segmentation results, and gait parameters).

In the **Results** section, I will check for any additional insights or analyses performed on the dataset, which may provide context on its application and significance in the field of gait analysis.

The paper mentions that the GaitMotion dataset includes:
- Data from 10 subjects performing walking tasks under three different conditions: Normal, Parkinsonâ€™s, and Stroke.
- Extensive ground-truth labeling for multiple tasks, including step segmentation and gait parameter estimation.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the GaitMotion dataset. The authors state that the dataset is publicly accessible at a specific GitHub repository, which is crucial for proper citation.

The full citation for the GaitMotion dataset is:
> Wenwen Zhang, Hao Zhang, Zenan Jiang, Jing Wang, Amir Servati, and Peyman Servati. *GaitMotion: A Multitask Dataset for Pathological Gait Forecasting*. Available at: https://github.com/Zhang-Wenwen/GaitMotion.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and full citation in the required format. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the dataset for future reference or analysis.
