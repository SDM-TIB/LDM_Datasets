To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CE-QArg: Counterfactual Explanations for Quantitative Bipolar Argumentation Frameworks" by Xiang Yin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and while it may not explicitly mention datasets, it can hint at the data used for empirical evaluations.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 7) since this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. I will look for any specific mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

In this paper, the authors discuss their empirical evaluations on randomly generated Quantitative Bipolar Argumentation Frameworks (QBAFs). However, they do not mention any external datasets but rather focus on the generation of their own data for testing their algorithm. This means I need to note that the datasets used are not publicly available datasets but rather synthetic data generated for the purpose of the study.

Since there are no specific datasets cited from external sources, I will not be able to provide full citations for datasets as they do not exist in this context. Instead, I will summarize the nature of the data used in the experiments.

Now, I will compile my findings into a structured format, ensuring to clearly state that the data used in the experiments are synthetically generated QBAFs and do not have formal citations as they are not derived from established datasets.

In conclusion, I will document that the paper does not reference any external datasets but relies on generated data for its evaluations, and I will ensure to clarify this in my final output.
