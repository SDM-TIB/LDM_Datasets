To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Sparsity-Guided Holistic Explanation for LLMs with Interpretable Inference-Time Intervention" by Zhen Tan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions empirical evaluations on real-world datasets, which suggests that datasets are indeed used in the research.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically looking for any tables or descriptions that outline the datasets used. In this case, I find a table (Table 1) that lists two datasets: **CEBaB** and **IMDB-C**. I will note the details provided for each dataset, including their purpose and the statistics related to training, validation, and testing splits.

1. **CEBaB Dataset**: This dataset is used for a 5-way classification task. The statistics indicate that it has 1755 training samples, 1673 validation samples, and 1685 test samples. The dataset includes concepts such as "Food," "Ambiance," "Service," and "Noise," with counts for each concept's classification.

2. **IMDB-C Dataset**: This dataset is used for a 2-way classification task. It has 100 training samples, 50 validation samples, and 50 test samples. The concepts include "Acting," "Storyline," and "Emotion," with counts for each concept's classification.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The paper cites the following:

- For **CEBaB**, the citation is:
  > Abraham, E. D.; D’Oosterlinck, K.; Feder, A.; Gat, Y.; Geiger, A.; Potts, C.; Reichart, R.; and Wu, Z. (2022). CEBaB: Estimating the causal effects of real-world concepts on NLP model behavior. In NeurIPS, 35: 17582–17596.

- For **IMDB-C**, the citation is:
  > Tan, Z.; Cheng, L.; Wang, S.; Bo, Y.; Li, J.; and Liu, H. (2023). Interpreting Pretrained Language Models via Concept Bottlenecks. arXiv:2311.05014.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this into a structured format for further processing or review. This includes ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation, which is crucial for proper attribution and reference in future work.
