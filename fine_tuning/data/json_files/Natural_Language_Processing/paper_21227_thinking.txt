To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Riemannian Covariance Fitting for Direction-of-Arrival Estimation" by Joseph S. Picard, Amitay Bar, and Ronen Talmon, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and the introduction often highlights the datasets used for experiments or comparisons.

Next, I will look for specific sections that typically contain dataset information, such as **"Datasets," "Experiments," or "Methodology."** In this paper, I will pay particular attention to any mention of datasets used for simulations or evaluations of the proposed methods.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors do not explicitly mention any publicly available datasets. Instead, they describe their own experimental setup involving simulated data for direction-of-arrival (DoA) estimation. This includes the use of phased arrays and various signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) but lacks references to established datasets.

Since there are no datasets explicitly cited in the paper, I will check the **References section** for any related works that might have used datasets relevant to the experiments conducted in this study. However, it appears that the references primarily focus on theoretical frameworks and methodologies rather than specific datasets.

Given that the paper does not provide any dataset citations, I will conclude that there are no datasets to extract from this paper. If there were datasets mentioned, I would ensure to note their names and provide full citations as required.

In summary, I will compile my findings, noting that no datasets were explicitly mentioned or cited in the paper, and thus there are no dataset entries to create.
