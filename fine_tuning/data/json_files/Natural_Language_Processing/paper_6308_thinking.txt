To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Leveraging Pretrained Language Models for Detecting Homophobia and Transphobia in Social Media Comments" by Vitthal Bhandari and Poonam Goyal, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and datasets sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors experimented with a "carefully annotated, real life dataset of YouTube comments in English as well as Tamil." This suggests that there are specific datasets used in their experiments.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experimental Setup)**, particularly **subsection 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the dataset used for their task. Here, they mention that the dataset consists of **15,141 multilingual YouTube comments** classified into three categories: Homophobic, Transphobic, and Non-anti-LGBT+ content. The breakdown of the dataset is also provided in Table 1, which details the distribution of comments across training, development, and test sets for English, Tamil, and Tamil-English.

To ensure I have the correct citation for the dataset, I will check the **References section** of the paper. The authors cite the dataset as follows:

- For the dataset used in their experiments, the citation is:
  > Bharathi Raja Chakravarthi, Ruba Priyadharshini, Rahul Ponnusamy, Prasanna Kumar Kumaresan, S. Thangasamy, John P. McCrae. 2021b. Dataset for identification of homophobia and transphobia in multilingual YouTube comments. ArXiv, abs/2109.00227.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the dataset information:

1. **Dataset Name**: Multilingual YouTube Comments Dataset
   - **Description**: A collection of 15,141 multilingual YouTube comments classified as Homophobic, Transphobic, or Non-anti-LGBT+ content.
   - **Citation**: Bharathi Raja Chakravarthi, Ruba Priyadharshini, Rahul Ponnusamy, Prasanna Kumar Kumaresan, S. Thangasamy, John P. McCrae. 2021b. Dataset for identification of homophobia and transphobia in multilingual YouTube comments. ArXiv, abs/2109.00227.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This systematic approach ensures that I accurately capture the datasets referenced in the paper along with their proper citations.
