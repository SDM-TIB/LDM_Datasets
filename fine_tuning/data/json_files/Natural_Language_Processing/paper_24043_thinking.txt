To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Calibrating Where It Matters: Constrained Temperature Scaling" by Stephen J. McKenna and Jacob Carse, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors demonstrate their method using the **ISIC 2019 challenge dermoscopy dataset**, which suggests that this dataset is crucial for their experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors provide more details about the dataset. They mention using images from the **ISIC 2019 challenge dataset** of dermoscopic images of skin lesions, which includes seven classes of skin lesions, three benign and four malignant. This section confirms the dataset's relevance and provides context for its use.

I will also check the **references section** for the full citation of the ISIC 2019 challenge dataset. The relevant citation is:

- For the **ISIC 2019 challenge dataset**, the citation is:
  > N. Codella, D. Gutman, E. Celebi, B. Helba, M. Marchetti, S. Dusza, A. Kalloo, K. Liopyris, N. Mishra, H. Kittler, et al. *Skin lesion analysis toward melanoma detection: A challenge at the 2017 International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI), hosted by the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC)*. In IEEE ISBI, pages 168â€“172, 2018.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. This includes ensuring that the dataset name, description, and citation are clearly articulated for any downstream applications or reviews.
