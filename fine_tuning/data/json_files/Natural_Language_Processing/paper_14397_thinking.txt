To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Safe Non-Stochastic Control of Control-Affine Systems: An Online Convex Optimization Approach" by Hongyu Zhou et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract discusses validating the algorithm in simulated scenarios, which suggests that there may be datasets or simulation environments referenced later in the paper.

Next, I will examine the **numerical evaluations** section (Section VI) closely, as this is where the authors typically describe the experiments conducted and the datasets or simulation environments used. In this section, the authors mention two specific scenarios: 

1. **Inverted Pendulum**: The authors describe a simulation setup for an inverted pendulum model, detailing its dynamics and the control inputs used. However, they do not specify a dataset in the traditional sense, as this is a simulation rather than a dataset derived from real-world data.

2. **Quadrotor**: The authors provide a detailed description of the quadrotor dynamics and the Gazebo simulation environment used for testing their algorithm. They mention using occupancy grid mapping and external force estimation, but again, this is more about the simulation setup rather than a dataset.

Since the paper primarily discusses simulations rather than traditional datasets, I will note that there are no publicly available datasets cited in the paper. However, I will still look for any references to prior works or datasets that may have been used in the context of the simulations.

Next, I will check the **References section** to see if any datasets or related works are cited that could be relevant. I will look for any papers that might describe datasets used in similar contexts, such as those related to control systems or robotics.

After reviewing the references, I will compile the information I have gathered. If I find any relevant citations, I will ensure to include the full citation for each dataset or simulation environment mentioned.

In conclusion, I will summarize my findings, noting that while the paper does not explicitly mention traditional datasets, it does reference simulation environments and methodologies that are crucial for understanding the experiments conducted. If any relevant citations are found in the references, I will include those as well.
