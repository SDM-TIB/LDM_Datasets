To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Visual Storytelling with Question-Answer Plans" by Danyang Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are mentioned. The abstract mentions the use of the **VIST benchmark** for evaluation, which suggests that this is a key dataset used in the research.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors describe their experiments in section 4.1, where they explicitly state that they performed experiments on the **VIST dataset**. 

In section 4.1, the authors provide details about the VIST dataset, noting that it contains **10,117 Flickr albums and 210,819 unique photos**, with each training sample consisting of **5 images and a corresponding story of 5 sentences**. This information is crucial for understanding the dataset's structure and purpose.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the VIST dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:
> Huang, F., Ferraro, F., Mostafazadeh, N., Misra, I., Agrawal, A., Devlin, J., Girshick, R., He, X., Kohli, P., Batra, D., et al. (2016). Visual storytelling. In Proceedings of the 2016 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, pages 1233â€“1239.

Having gathered this information, I will compile the dataset details into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the VIST dataset as it is essential for proper attribution.

In summary, the steps I followed are:
1. Read the abstract and introduction to identify any datasets.
2. Locate the datasets section or relevant mentions in the methodology/experiments sections.
3. Extract details about the VIST dataset from section 4.1.
4. Retrieve the full citation from the References section.

Now, I will prepare the dataset entry for the VIST dataset, ensuring that it includes all necessary details and the full citation.
