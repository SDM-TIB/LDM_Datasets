To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Equip Vision Occupancy with Instance Segmentation and Visual Grounding" by Zichao Dong et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions occupancy prediction tasks and references existing works, which may indicate the presence of datasets used for evaluation. The introduction elaborates on the significance of occupancy perception and may provide insights into specific datasets utilized in the research.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments** section. In this paper, the authors mention conducting experiments on the **NYUv2 dataset**. I will gather details about this dataset, including its purpose, size, and any specific configurations used in the experiments.

In the **experiments section**, the authors specify that they used the NYUv2 dataset, which consists of 1449 indoor scenes, with a training split of 795 scenes and a test split of 654 scenes. This information is crucial for understanding how the dataset was utilized in their research.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the NYUv2 dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Nathan Silberman, Derek Hoiem, Pushmeet Kohli, and Rob Fergus. *Indoor segmentation and support inference from RGBD images*. In Computer Vision–ECCV 2012: 12th European Conference on Computer Vision, Florence, Italy, October 7-13, 2012, Proceedings, Part V 12, pages 746–760. Springer, 2012.

Since the paper primarily discusses the NYUv2 dataset, I will focus on this dataset for extraction. I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that the full citation is included.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for the NYUv2 dataset, ensuring that all relevant details are captured accurately for future reference or processing.
