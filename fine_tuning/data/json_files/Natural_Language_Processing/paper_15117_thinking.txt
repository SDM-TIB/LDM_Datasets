To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Neural networks for insurance pricing with frequency and severity data: a benchmark study from data preprocessing to technical tariff" by Freek Holvoet et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the paper discusses a benchmark study on **four insurance datasets** with frequency and severity targets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Data sets)**, where the authors provide a clear overview of the datasets used in their benchmark study. Here, I will find the following datasets:

1. **Australian MTPL Dataset**: This dataset is described as containing 67,856 observations for frequency and 4,624 for severity, with various covariates including vehicle value, vehicle age, and policyholder characteristics.

2. **Belgian MTPL Dataset**: This dataset includes 163,212 observations for frequency and 18,276 for severity, with a mix of continuous, categorical, and spatial variables.

3. **French MTPL Dataset**: This dataset has 668,897 observations for frequency and 24,944 for severity, also containing a variety of covariates.

4. **Norwegian MTPL Dataset**: This dataset consists of 183,999 observations for frequency and 8,444 for severity, with similar variable types as the others.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **Australian MTPL Dataset**:
  > Dutang, C., & Charpentier, A. (2019). CASdatasets: insurance datasets. R package version 1.0.10.

- For the **Belgian MTPL Dataset**:
  > Henckaerts, R., & Antonio, K. (2022). The added value of dynamically updating motor insurance prices with telematics collected driving behavior data. Insurance: Mathematics and Economics, 105, 79-95.

- For the **French MTPL Dataset**:
  > Dutang, C., & Charpentier, A. (2019). CASdatasets: insurance datasets. R package version 1.0.10.

- For the **Norwegian MTPL Dataset**:
  > Dutang, C., & Charpentier, A. (2019). CASdatasets: insurance datasets. R package version 1.0.10.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations in a structured format for clarity and ease of use.

In summary, I will extract the datasets by:
1. Reading the relevant sections of the paper to identify datasets.
2. Documenting the datasets and their descriptions.
3. Retrieving full citations from the references for each dataset.
4. Compiling this information into a structured format for further use.
