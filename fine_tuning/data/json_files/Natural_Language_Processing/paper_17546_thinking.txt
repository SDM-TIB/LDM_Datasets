To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Modality-missing RGBT Tracking via Invertible Prompt Learning and A High-quality Data Simulation Method" by Andong Lu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors propose a high-quality data simulation method and mention the lack of a modality-missing RGBT tracking dataset, which suggests that datasets are a key focus of the paper.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **introduction**. The authors reference three representative RGBT tracking datasets: **RGBT234**, **LasHeR**, and **VTUAV**. They also mention that these datasets are used to construct three new modality-missing datasets: **RGBT234-Miss**, **LasHeR245-Miss**, and **VTUAV176-Miss**.

In the **methodology section**, the authors describe how they generated the modality-missing datasets based on the existing datasets. They provide details about the construction of these new datasets, confirming their significance in the research.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

1. **RGBT234**:
   > Chenglong Li, Xinyan Liang, Yijuan Lu, Nan Zhao, and Jin Tang. *RGB-T Object Tracking: Benchmark and Baseline*. Pattern Recognition, 96:106977, 2019.

2. **LasHeR**:
   > Chenglong Li, Wanlin Xue, Yaqing Jia, Zhichen Qu, Bin Luo, Jin Tang, and Dengdi Sun. *LasHeR: A Large-scale High-diversity Benchmark for RGBT Tracking*. IEEE Transactions on Image Processing, 31:392â€“404, 2021.

3. **VTUAV**:
   > Zhang Pengyu, Jie Zhao, Dong Wang, Huchuan Lu, and Xiang Ruan. *Visible-thermal UAV Tracking: A Large-scale Benchmark and New Baseline*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2022.

4. **RGBT234-Miss**:
   > This dataset is derived from RGBT234 and does not have a separate citation since it is a new dataset created by the authors.

5. **LasHeR245-Miss**:
   > This dataset is derived from LasHeR and does not have a separate citation since it is a new dataset created by the authors.

6. **VTUAV176-Miss**:
   > This dataset is derived from VTUAV and does not have a separate citation since it is a new dataset created by the authors.

Having gathered this information, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations. This will ensure that I have accurately documented the datasets used in the research paper, along with their full citations for reference.
