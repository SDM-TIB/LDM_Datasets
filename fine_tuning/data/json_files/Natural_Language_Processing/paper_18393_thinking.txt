To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Transparency Attacks: How Imperceptible Image Layers Can Fool AI Perception" by Forrest McKee and David Noever, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract discusses the concept of dataset poisoning and mentions the use of a collection of grayscale landscapes and logos. This indicates that there may be specific datasets referenced later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methods** or **results** sections. In this paper, the authors describe their methodology for conducting transparency attacks and mention the use of various image pairs, but they do not explicitly name datasets in a dedicated section. Instead, I will need to extract information from the context where they describe their experiments and results.

In the **results section**, the authors provide examples of image pairs used in their experiments, such as blending a military tank with a bridge or a baby stroller with an airplane. However, they do not provide formal dataset names or citations. I will need to infer the datasets based on the context and examples given.

I will also check the **references section** for any datasets that might be cited indirectly. The authors reference various works related to adversarial attacks and image processing, but I need to identify if any of these references correspond to datasets.

After reviewing the paper, I will compile the information I have gathered about the datasets. Since the paper does not provide formal dataset names or citations, I will note the examples of image pairs used in the experiments and any relevant references that could be associated with these datasets.

Finally, I will ensure to document the findings clearly, including any relevant citations from the references section that may pertain to the datasets or methodologies discussed in the paper. If specific datasets are not named, I will indicate that in my documentation.

In summary, my steps will include:
1. Review the abstract and introduction for initial mentions of datasets.
2. Examine the methods and results sections for any dataset descriptions or examples.
3. Check the references for any potential dataset citations.
4. Compile the findings, noting any examples of image pairs and relevant citations, even if formal datasets are not explicitly named.

This structured approach will help ensure that I capture all relevant information regarding datasets from the paper, even if they are not explicitly labeled as such.
