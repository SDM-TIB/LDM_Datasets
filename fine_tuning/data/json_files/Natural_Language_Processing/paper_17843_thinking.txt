To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Hierarchical Classification of Transversal Skills in Job Ads Based on Sentence Embeddings" by Florin Leon et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental study sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors created their own dataset of job ads annotated with skills from the ESCO taxonomy, which suggests that this dataset is crucial for their research.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, specifically where the authors describe the data collection process. They mention that they collected **219 job ads from the EURES online platform** and manually labeled them according to the ESCO skill framework. This is a clear indication of the dataset they used for their experiments.

In the **results and discussion sections**, I will look for any additional datasets mentioned or referenced. However, the primary dataset appears to be the one they created from the job ads, as they emphasize its importance for their hierarchical classification approach.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the ESCO taxonomy, which is essential for understanding the dataset's context. The ESCO framework is referenced as a classification system for skills and competences, but it may not have a specific citation in the traditional sense since it is an initiative by the European Commission.

The relevant citations I will compile are:

1. **EURES Job Ads Dataset**:
   > Leon, F., Gavrilescu, M., Floria, S.-A., & Minea, A.-A. (2024). Hierarchical Classification of Transversal Skills in Job Ads Based on Sentence Embeddings. *Preprint*.

2. **ESCO Taxonomy**:
   > European Commission, Directorate-General for Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion. (2022). ESCO Publications: Skills & competences. Available online: https://esco.ec.europa.eu/en/classification/skill_main.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets in a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly identified along with its citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
