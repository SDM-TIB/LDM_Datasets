To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Gated Embeddings in End-to-End Speech Recognition for Conversational-Context Fusion" by Suyoun Kim et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant details, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their models on the **Switchboard conversational speech corpus**, which suggests that this dataset is crucial for their experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 5) where the authors provide a detailed description of the datasets used. In this section, they mention using the **Switchboard (SWBD) LDC corpus (97S62)** for their evaluations. They also provide statistics about the dataset, such as the number of utterances, conversations, and average utterances per conversation.

I will note the specific details provided in the paper:
- **Switchboard (SWBD) LDC corpus (97S62)**: The authors used 300 hours of the SWBD training set, splitting it into 285 hours for model training and 5 hours for hyper-parameter tuning. They also mention evaluating the model on the HUB5 Eval2000, which consists of the Callhome English (CH) and Switchboard (SWBD) datasets.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the Switchboard dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:
> John Godfrey and Edward Holliman. *Switchboard-1 release 2 ldc97s62*. Linguistic Data Consortium, Philadelphia, 1993.

With this information, I can summarize the datasets extracted from the paper:

1. **Switchboard (SWBD) LDC corpus (97S62)**: This dataset is used for training and evaluation in the experiments, consisting of conversational speech data.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations as required. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets utilized in the research.
