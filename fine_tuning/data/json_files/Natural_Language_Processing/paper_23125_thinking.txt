To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Spectral Truncation Kernels: Noncommutativity in C ∗-algebraic Kernel Machines" by Yuka Hashimoto et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract does not explicitly mention any datasets, so I will proceed to the introduction.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the application of their proposed kernels in various contexts but do not specify any datasets. I will then check the **experiments section** for any references to datasets used in their evaluations.

Upon reaching the **experiments section**, I will look for any specific mentions of datasets. The authors describe experiments involving kernel ridge regression and mention using the **MNIST dataset** for an image recovering task. This is a well-known dataset in machine learning, particularly for image classification tasks.

Next, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the MNIST dataset. The citation for the MNIST dataset is:

- **MNIST Dataset**: 
  > Yann LeCun, Léon Bottou, Yoshua Bengio, and Patrick Haffner. *Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition*. Proceedings of the IEEE, 86(11):2278–2324, 1998.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format.

The only dataset extracted from this paper is the MNIST dataset, and I will ensure to include its full citation as required. 

Now, I will prepare the dataset entry for the MNIST dataset, ensuring that it is clear and complete for any future reference or processing.
