To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On decentralized computation of the leader’s strategy in bi-level games" by Marko Maljkovic, Gustav Nilsson, and Nikolas Geroliminis, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract may provide a brief overview of the experiments conducted, which could include dataset names or descriptions.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to see if the authors mention any specific datasets used in their research. This section often provides context for the study and may highlight key datasets that are central to the experiments.

I will then look for a dedicated **section on datasets or experiments**. In many research papers, authors will explicitly list the datasets they used, along with details such as the number of samples, features, and any relevant characteristics. If such a section exists, I will extract the names and descriptions of the datasets from there.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. I will look for papers or reports that describe the datasets in detail.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like "Penn Action Dataset," I would find its citation, which might look something like this:
> Wenzheng Zhang, Menglong Zhu, and Konstantinos G. Derpanis. *From Actemes to Action: A Strongly-Supervised Representation for Detailed Action Understanding*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 2248–2255, 2013.

Finally, I will compile the extracted datasets and their citations into a structured format for easy reference. This will ensure that all relevant information is captured and can be used for further analysis or research.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and cite the datasets used in the research paper.
