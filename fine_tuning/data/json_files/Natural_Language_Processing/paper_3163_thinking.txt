To extract datasets from the research paper titled "One Size Does Not Fit All: Finding the Optimal Subword Sizes for FastText Models across Languages" by Vít Novotný et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the optimization of subword sizes for various languages, which suggests that datasets related to word analogy tasks might be involved.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **methods** and **results** sections. In the methods section, the authors describe training FastText models on various Wikipedia corpora for different languages, which indicates that these corpora are the datasets used for their experiments. 

I will identify the specific datasets mentioned:
1. **English Wikipedia Corpus**: Used for training FastText models.
2. **German Wikipedia Corpus**: Also used for training.
3. **Czech Wikipedia Corpus**: Another dataset used in the experiments.
4. **Italian Wikipedia Corpus**: Included in the training datasets.
5. **Spanish Wikipedia Corpus**: Part of the training datasets.
6. **French Wikipedia Corpus**: Used for training.
7. **Hindi Wikipedia Corpus**: Another dataset in the training set.
8. **Turkish Wikipedia Corpus**: Included in the training datasets.
9. **Russian Wikipedia Corpus**: Also used for training.

In the **results** section, the authors discuss the performance of their models on word analogy tasks for these languages, confirming that these Wikipedia corpora are indeed the datasets they utilized.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for these datasets. However, since these datasets are based on Wikipedia, I will provide a general citation for Wikipedia as the source of these corpora:

- For the Wikipedia datasets, the citation is:
  > Wikimedia Foundation. *Wikipedia: The Free Encyclopedia*. Available at: https://www.wikipedia.org/

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. Each dataset will be documented with its name and the corresponding citation.
