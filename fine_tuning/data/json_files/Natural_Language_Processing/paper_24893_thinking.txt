To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Multicategory Framework Using Deep Neural Network for Image Classification" by Jairo JosÃ© Orozco Sandoval et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to find any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the methodology is tested with "three to five categories of jets from the JetNet benchmark jet tagging dataset," indicating that a specific dataset is being utilized.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors discuss the context of their research and the importance of machine learning in analyzing jet data from the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). They mention the use of jets and the need for effective classification methods, but I need to look for explicit dataset names.

In the **methodology section**, the authors specifically mention that the data used for their work is sourced from **JetNet**, a Python library designed for machine learning research in high-energy physics. They describe the dataset as including jets from various particle types, such as gluons, light quarks, top quarks, W bosons, and Z bosons. This section provides a clear identification of the dataset being used.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the JetNet dataset. The relevant citation is:

- **JetNet Dataset**:
  > Huilin Qu, Loukas Gouskos. *ParticleNet: Jet Tagging via Particle Clouds*. arXiv:1902.08570.

This citation is crucial as it provides the necessary details for anyone looking to access or reference the dataset.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the dataset details, ensuring to include the full citation for the JetNet dataset. This will allow for a clear understanding of the dataset's context and its relevance to the research conducted in the paper.
