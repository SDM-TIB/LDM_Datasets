To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Artificial Intelligence for Drug Discovery: Are We There Yet?" by Catrin Hasselgren and Tudor I. Oprea, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections that discuss AI applications in drug discovery**. The abstract provides a general overview of the paper's focus, while the introduction outlines the context and significance of AI in drug discovery. I will pay close attention to any specific datasets mentioned.

Next, I will examine **section 3 (AI applications in various stages of drug discovery)**, as this section is likely to contain detailed discussions about datasets used in AI-driven drug discovery processes. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, descriptions, and any relevant statistics.

In **section 4 (Brief overview of AI-driven drug discovery successes)**, I will check for any case studies or examples that reference specific datasets used in successful AI applications. This section may provide insights into datasets that have been instrumental in achieving notable outcomes in drug discovery.

After identifying potential datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This is crucial for ensuring proper attribution and for readers who may want to explore the datasets further.

For example, if the paper mentions the **Therapeutic Data Commons (TDC)** as a resource for multiple ML-ready datasets, I will look for the citation that describes TDC in detail. Similarly, if the paper references specific datasets like **DrugCentral** or **OCHEM**, I will find their respective citations.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will help in accurately documenting the datasets referenced in the paper.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for review or further processing, ensuring that all information is clear, concise, and properly cited.
