To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CycLight: learning traffic signal cooperation with a cycle-level strategy" by Gengyue Han et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their full citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study and may mention any datasets used for testing or validation. In this case, the abstract discusses the testing of CycLight in a "large synthetic traffic grid using the microscopic traffic simulation tool, SUMO," which indicates that a synthetic dataset is involved.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** in detail. This section typically contains information about the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors describe the synthetic traffic grid and the various traffic demand scenarios designed for testing. I will note that the paper does not reference any external datasets but instead relies on a synthetic dataset created for the experiments.

I will also check the **methodology section** for any additional details about how the dataset was generated or structured. The authors mention that the experiments were conducted in a "5*5 synthetic traffic grid," which suggests that the dataset is based on this specific simulation setup.

After gathering this information, I will look at the **References section** to see if there are any citations related to the datasets. However, since the dataset is synthetic and generated specifically for this study, there may not be a formal citation for it. Instead, I will note the details of the synthetic dataset as described in the paper.

The key points to extract regarding the dataset are:

1. **Dataset Name**: Synthetic Traffic Grid Dataset
   - **Description**: A synthetic dataset created for testing the CycLight approach in a 5*5 traffic grid using the SUMO simulation tool. It includes various traffic demand scenarios to simulate different traffic distributions and flow rates.
   - **Citation**: Since this dataset is not published separately, I will reference the paper itself as the source of the dataset.

Now, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the paper as the source of the dataset.

The full citation for the paper is:
> Gengyue Han, Xiaohan Liu, Xianyue Peng, Hao Wang, and Yu Han. *CycLight: learning traffic signal cooperation with a cycle-level strategy*. Preprint submitted to Elsevier.

With this information, I will prepare the dataset entry for review or further processing.
