To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Costly Persuasion by a Partially Informed Sender" by Shaofei Jiang, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly referenced. The abstract provides a concise overview of the research, and the introduction often discusses the context and relevance of the study, which may include mentions of datasets.

Next, I will look for any **specific sections that might detail datasets**, such as a dedicated "Datasets" or "Data" section. If such a section exists, it will likely contain the most relevant information about the datasets used in the research.

If no dedicated section is present, I will check the **experiments or results sections** where datasets are typically utilized. Here, the author may describe the datasets used for analysis or experimentation, including their characteristics and how they were applied in the study.

As I identify datasets, I will take note of their names, descriptions, and any relevant details such as the number of samples, types of data, and the context in which they were used. 

After gathering this information, I will consult the **References section** of the paper to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial as it provides the necessary attribution and allows others to locate the datasets for their own use.

For example, if I find a dataset named "Dataset A" used in the analysis, I will document it as follows:
- **Dataset Name**: Dataset A
- **Description**: A brief description of what the dataset contains and its relevance to the study.
- **Full Citation**: The complete reference as listed in the paper.

Finally, I will compile all the extracted datasets into a structured format that includes their names, descriptions, and citations, ensuring that each dataset is clearly documented for future reference.

By following these steps, I will ensure a thorough and accurate extraction of datasets from the research paper.
