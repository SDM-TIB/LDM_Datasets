To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Read Beyond the Lines: Understanding the Implied Textual Meaning via A Skim and Intensive Reading Model" by Guoxiu He et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study but does not explicitly mention datasets. However, the introduction discusses the challenges of understanding implied meanings in text, which may lead to the identification of relevant datasets later.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention that they conducted experiments on three publicly available benchmark datasets for sarcasm detection and one industrial spam detection dataset. This indicates that there are specific datasets to extract.

I will look for a **table summarizing the datasets** (Table 1 in this case) and read the accompanying text to gather detailed information about each dataset. The paper lists the following datasets:

1. **Tweets/ghosh**: A sarcasm detection dataset collected from Twitter, containing 50,736 training samples and 3,680 test samples.
2. **Reddit/movies**: Another sarcasm detection dataset collected from Reddit, with 13,535 training samples and 1,504 test samples.
3. **IAC/v1**: A dataset from the Internet Argument Corpus, containing 1,483 samples.
4. **Industry/spam**: A dataset for spam detection in Chinese online novels, with 20,609 training samples and 6,871 test samples.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The authors reference the sources for the sarcasm datasets as follows:

- For **Tweets/ghosh**, the citation is:
  > A. Ghosh, T. Veale, "Fracking sarcasm using neural network," in Proceedings of the 7th workshop on computational approaches to subjectivity, sentiment and social media analysis, 2016, pp. 161–169.

- For **Reddit/movies**, the citation is:
  > M. Khodak, N. Saunshi, K. Vodrahalli, "A large self-annotated corpus for sarcasm," in Proceedings of the Eleventh International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC-2018), 2018, pp. 641–646.

- For **IAC/v1**, the citation is:
  > M. A. Walker, J. E. F. Tree, P. Anand, R. Abbott, J. King, "A corpus for research on deliberation and debate," in LREC, Istanbul, 2012, pp. 812–817.

- For **Industry/spam**, the citation is not explicitly mentioned in the references, but it is described as a dataset of spam novels confirmed by auditors.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ready for further processing or review.
