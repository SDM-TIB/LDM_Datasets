To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-Label Meta Weighting for Long-Tailed Dynamic Scene Graph Generation" by Shuo Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract highlights the evaluation of the proposed method on two benchmarks: **Action Genome** and **VidOR**. This indicates that these datasets are likely to be discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will navigate to **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors provide specific details about the datasets used in their experiments. Here, I will find the following datasets:

1. **Action Genome**: This dataset is described as containing 234,253 annotated frames with 476,229 bounding boxes across 35 object classes and 1,715,568 instances of 25 relationship classes. The authors explain the types of relationships included and the strategies for generating scene graphs.

2. **VidOR**: This dataset consists of 10,000 user-generated videos, totaling approximately 84 hours of footage. It includes 80 object categories and 50 predicate categories, along with annotated relation triplets and bounding boxes of objects.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for each dataset:

- For **Action Genome**, the citation is:
  > Jingwei Ji, Ranjay Krishna, Li Fei-Fei, and Juan Carlos Niebles. *Action Genome: Actions as compositions of spatio-temporal scene graphs*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 10233–10244, 2020.

- For **VidOR**, the citation is:
  > Xindi Shang, Donglin Di, Junbin Xiao, Yu Cao, Xun Yang, and Tat-Seng Chua. *Annotating objects and relations in user-generated videos*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Multimedia Retrieval (ICMR), pages 279–287, 2019.

Now that I have the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or processing. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the necessary details about each dataset, including their significance in the context of the research presented in the paper.
