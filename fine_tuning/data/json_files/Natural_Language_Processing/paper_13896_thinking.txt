To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Leveraging the Power of Data Augmentation for Transformer-based Tracking" by Jie Zhao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the effectiveness of data augmentation methods on transformer-based trackers, but it does not specify any datasets. Therefore, I will focus on the introduction and experiments sections for more details.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention that "some large-scale tracking datasets with high-quality manual annotations are also developed to satisfy these data-driven models." However, they do not name any specific datasets here. 

Next, I will examine **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe their experimental setup. They mention using several datasets for training and evaluation, specifically **LaSOT**, **GOT-10k**, **TrackingNet**, and **COCO**. This is a crucial finding as it indicates the datasets used in their experiments.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. **LaSOT Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Heng Fan, Hexin Bai, Liting Lin, Fan Yang, Peng Chu, Ge Deng, Sijia Yu, Mingzhen Huang, Juehuan Liu, Yong Xu, et al. *LaSOT: A high-quality large-scale single object tracking benchmark*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 129:439–461, 2021.

2. **GOT-10k Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Lianghua Huang, Xin Zhao, and Kaiqi Huang. *GOT-10k: A large high-diversity benchmark for generic object tracking in the wild*. IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 43(5):1562–1577, 2019.

3. **TrackingNet Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Matthias Muller, Adel Bibi, Silvio Giancola, Salman Alsubaihi, and Bernard Ghanem. *TrackingNet: A large-scale dataset and benchmark for object tracking in the wild*. In European Conference on Computer Vision, pages 300–317, 2018.

4. **COCO Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, Serge Belongie, James Hays, Pietro Perona, Deva Ramanan, Piotr Dollár, and C Lawrence Zitnick. *Microsoft COCO: Common objects in context*. In European Conference on Computer Vision, pages 740–755, 2014.

Having gathered the dataset names and their corresponding citations, I will now compile this information into a structured format for clarity and future reference. This will ensure that I have accurately documented the datasets used in the research and their sources.
