To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CRAB: Cross-environment Agent Benchmark for Multimodal Language Model Agents" by Tianqi Xu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract indicates that the authors developed a benchmark called **Crab Benchmark-v0**, which includes a set of tasks. This suggests that there may be datasets associated with these tasks.

Next, I will focus on the **section detailing the Crab Benchmark**. In this section, the authors describe the benchmark's construction and mention that it includes **35 single tasks, 53 simple tasks, and 12 challenging tasks**. They also specify that the dataset comprises **29 Android tasks, 53 Ubuntu tasks, and 18 cross-platform tasks**. This is a clear indication of the datasets used in their experiments.

I will also check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. The paper does not provide specific citations for the datasets themselves, but it does reference other works that may have contributed to the datasets or methodologies used.

The relevant datasets extracted from the paper are:

1. **Crab Benchmark-v0**: This dataset includes a total of 100 tasks across different environments (Android and Ubuntu) and is designed for evaluating multimodal language model agents. The tasks are categorized into single tasks, simple tasks, and challenging tasks.

2. **Android Tasks**: A subset of the Crab Benchmark-v0, consisting of 29 tasks specifically designed for the Android environment.

3. **Ubuntu Tasks**: Another subset of the Crab Benchmark-v0, consisting of 53 tasks designed for the Ubuntu environment.

4. **Cross-platform Tasks**: This subset includes 18 tasks that require functionality across both Android and Ubuntu environments.

Now, I will compile the full citations for the datasets mentioned in the paper. Since the paper does not provide specific citations for the datasets, I will note the citation for the paper itself as it serves as the primary source for the datasets:

- Xu, T., Chen, L., Wu, D.-J., Yao, X., Xie, Z., Chen, Y., Liu, S., Qian, B., Torr, P., Ghanem, B., Li, G., Chen, Y., & Zhang, Z. (2024). CRAB: Cross-environment Agent Benchmark for Multimodal Language Model Agents. *arXiv preprint arXiv:2404.07972*.

With this information, I can now create structured entries for each dataset based on the findings from the paper.
