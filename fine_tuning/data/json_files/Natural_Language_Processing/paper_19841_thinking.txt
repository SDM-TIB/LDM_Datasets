To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Mitigating Label Flipping Attacks in Malicious URL Detectors Using Ensemble Trees" by Ehsan Nowroozi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted a case study using the **Alexa** and **Phishing Site URL datasets**, which suggests that these datasets are significant for their research.

Next, I will examine the **methodology section**, specifically the subsection labeled **Datasets**. Here, the authors describe the datasets used in their experiments. They mention that they used a dataset of **3,980,870 benign and malicious URLs** gathered from twelve different datasets, which were then merged into six datasets. The specific datasets listed in **Table II** include:

1. **Pristine Alexa**
2. **Pristine Crowdflower**
3. **Pristine DMOZ**
4. **Benign set URL**
5. **Non-malicious URL**
6. **Pristine ISCX**

For the malicious datasets, they include:

1. **Phishing Site URL**
2. **Phishtank**
3. **Malicious data URL**
4. **ISCX-URL-2016**
5. **Phishstrom**
6. **Malicious set URL**

The authors then detail how these datasets were combined into six merged datasets, which are listed in **Table III**. I will need to ensure I capture the names of these combined datasets as well.

Next, I will look at the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The citations for the datasets used in the study are crucial for proper attribution. I will check for any specific papers or sources that describe the datasets, especially for the **Alexa** and **Phishing Site URL datasets**.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.

Finally, I will ensure that the extracted information is clear and organized, ready for any further processing or presentation.
