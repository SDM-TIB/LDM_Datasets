To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Ranking Entities along Conceptual Space Dimensions with LLMs: An Analysis of Fine-Tuning Strategies" by Nitesh Kumar, Usashi Chatterjee, and Steven Schockaert, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their methods on three datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention:

1. **Wikidata**: This dataset consists of 20 rankings derived from numerical features available on Wikidata, such as the length of rivers and the population of cities. The authors also mention splitting this dataset into WD1 and WD2 for different experiments.

2. **Taste Dataset**: This dataset includes ratings of 590 food items across six taste dimensions (sweetness, sourness, saltiness, bitterness, fattiness, and umaminess). The dataset was created by Martin et al. (2014) and later cleaned by Chatterjee et al. (2023).

3. **Rocks Dataset**: Created by Nosofsky et al. (2018), this dataset contains 30 types of rocks, with each type assessed along 7 dimensions relevant for ranking.

4. **Tag Genome Dataset**: This dataset, collected by Vig et al. (2012), includes movies and books rated on various tags. The authors selected adjectives corresponding to ordinal features for their analysis.

5. **Physical Properties Dataset**: This dataset includes measurements of mass, size, and height, with ground truth obtained from Standley et al. (2017) and Liu et al. (2022b).

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for each dataset:

- For **Wikidata**, the citation is:
  > Wikidata contributors. *Wikidata: Main Page*. Available at: https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Main_Page.

- For **Taste Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Christophe Martin, Michel Visalli, Christine Lange, Pascal Schlich, and Sylvie Issanchou. *Creation of a food taste database using an in-home “taste” profile method*. Food Quality and Preference, 36:70–80, 2014.

- For **Rocks Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Robert M. Nosofsky, Craig A. Sanders, Brian J. Meagher, and Bruce J. Douglas. *Toward the development of a feature-space representation for a complex natural category domain*. Behavior Research Methods, 50:530–556, 2018.

- For **Tag Genome Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Jesse Vig, Shilad Sen, and John Riedl. *The tag genome: Encoding community knowledge to support novel interaction*. ACM Trans. Interact. Intell. Syst., 2(3):13:1–13:44, 2012.

- For **Physical Properties Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Trevor Standley, Ozan Sener, Dawn Chen, and Silvio Savarese. *Image2mass: Estimating the mass of an object from its image*. In Proceedings of the 1st Annual Conference on Robot Learning, CoRL 2017, pages 324–333, 2017.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations into a structured format for further processing or review.
