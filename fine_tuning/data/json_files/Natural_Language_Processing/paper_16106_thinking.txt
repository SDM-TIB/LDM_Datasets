To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-Objective Transmission Expansion: An Offshore Wind Power Integration Case Study" by Saroj Khanal et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any mention of datasets or data sources used in the research. 

In the **introduction**, I will look for any references to specific datasets that inform the study's context or methodology. The introduction often outlines the background and significance of the research, which may include key datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, where the authors typically describe the data sources and datasets used for their analysis. I will pay close attention to any specific datasets mentioned, such as operational data, generation data, or externality data.

In the **results section**, I will look for any additional datasets that may be referenced in the context of the findings. This section may also provide insights into how the datasets were utilized in the analysis.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** of the paper to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

Based on the content of the paper, I anticipate the following datasets may be relevant:

1. **ISO-NE 8-Zone Test System**: This dataset is mentioned as a basis for the case study and is likely to have a specific citation.
2. **PJM Test System**: Similar to the ISO-NE dataset, this is another test system used in the analysis, and I will look for its citation.
3. **Operational Data from ISO-NE**: The paper mentions using actual hourly load data from the ISO-NE website, which will need to be cited.
4. **Wind Power Data from NREL**: The dataset curated by the National Renewable Energy Lab (NREL) is referenced for offshore wind generation profiles, and I will find its citation.
5. **Intervention Model for Air Pollution (InMAP)**: This model is used to compute average marginal damages from local air pollution, and I will look for its citation.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information and citations, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, facilitating further exploration and validation of the study's findings.
