To extract datasets from the research paper titled "From Descriptive Richness to Bias: Unveiling the Dark Side of Generative Image Caption Enrichment" by Yusuke Hirota et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly referenced. The abstract mentions the comparison of standard-format captions and generative caption enrichment (GCE) processes, which suggests that datasets are involved in the analysis.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors discuss the use of various datasets in their analysis. They specifically mention the **COCO dataset** as a standard benchmark for image captioning. This is a significant dataset, and I will need to gather its full citation.

In the **evaluation framework section**, the authors introduce three GCE methods: **ShareGPT4V**, **FuseCap**, and **CapsFusion**. I will check if these methods are associated with specific datasets or if they utilize the COCO dataset for their evaluations.

As I continue through the paper, I will look for any **results or discussion sections** that might provide additional context or mention other datasets used in their experiments. The authors emphasize the importance of the COCO dataset in their analysis, particularly in relation to gender bias and hallucination.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. **COCO Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Xinlei Chen, Hao Fang, Tsung-Yi Lin, Ramakrishna Vedantam, Saurabh Gupta, Piotr Dollár, and C Lawrence Zitnick. *Microsoft COCO: Common objects in context*. In ECCV, 2014.

2. **ShareGPT4V**: This is a method rather than a dataset, but it references the following paper:
   > Lin Chen, Jisong Li, Xiaoyi Dong, Pan Zhang, Conghui He, Jiaqi Wang, Feng Zhao, and Dahua Lin. *Sharegpt4v: Improving large multimodal models with better captions*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2311.12793, 2023.

3. **FuseCap**: This method is also referenced in the paper:
   > Noam Rotstein, David Bensaïd, Shaked Brody, Roy Ganz, and Ron Kimmel. *Fusecap: Leveraging large language models for enriched fused image captions*. In WACV, 2024.

4. **CapsFusion**: The citation for this method is:
   > Qiying Yu, Quan Sun, Xiaosong Zhang, Yufeng Cui, Fan Zhang, Xinlong Wang, and Jingjing Liu. *Capsfusion: Rethinking image-text data at scale*. In CVPR, 2024.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately cited according to the references provided in the paper. This will allow for a comprehensive understanding of the datasets used in the research and their implications in the context of the study.
