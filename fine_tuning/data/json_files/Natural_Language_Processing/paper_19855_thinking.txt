To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MEBS: Multi-task End-to-end Bid Shading for Multi-slot Display Advertising" by Zhen Gong et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on bid shading in multi-slot display advertising, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets.

Next, I will examine **section 6 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe their experimental setup. Here, they mention utilizing a bidding dataset sampled from the Alibaba display ad platform. This is a crucial point as it indicates that a specific dataset is being used for their experiments.

In **subsection 6.1.1 (Experiment Setup)**, the authors provide more details about the dataset, stating that it consists of data from multi-slot second-price auctions over two days. They mention the statistics of the dataset, which include:
- **Total Samples**: 64,557,179,576
- **Won Samples**: 533,812,872
- **Clicked Samples**: 9,641,171

This information is essential for describing the dataset, but I need to ensure I have the full citation for the dataset as well.

Next, I will check the **References section** to see if there is a specific citation for the dataset used. However, it appears that the dataset is derived from internal data from the Alibaba display ad platform, and thus it may not have a formal citation like publicly available datasets.

Since the dataset is not published in a conventional manner, I will note that the dataset is proprietary and belongs to Alibaba, and I will include this information in my dataset description.

Now, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format, ensuring to include the dataset name, description, and the citation details as follows:

1. **Dataset Name**: Alibaba Bidding Dataset
   - **Description**: A dataset sampled from the Alibaba display ad platform, consisting of data from multi-slot second-price auctions over two days. It includes features such as bid price and contextual features, with labels indicating whether auctions were won and whether ads were clicked.
   - **Citation**: Proprietary dataset from Alibaba Group, not publicly available.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entry for review or further processing, ensuring that I have accurately captured all relevant details and citations.
