To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Benchmarking Stroke Forecasting with Stroke-Level Badminton Dataset" by Wei-Yao Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract introduces the **ShuttleSet22** dataset, which is a key focus of the paper. This indicates that there is at least one dataset to extract.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section more closely. Here, the authors describe ShuttleSet22 in detail, noting that it consists of 30,172 strokes across 2,888 rallies, with additional validation and testing sets. This section provides a good overview of the dataset's structure and purpose.

In the **methodology** section, I will look for any additional datasets mentioned or referenced. The authors compare ShuttleSet22 with another dataset, **BadmintonDB**, which is also relevant. They highlight the differences between these datasets, emphasizing the unique aspects of ShuttleSet22.

I will then check the **results and discussion sections** to see if there are any mentions of other datasets or comparisons that could be relevant. However, the primary focus remains on ShuttleSet22 and its benchmarking against existing datasets.

Finally, I will consult the **references section** to gather full citations for both datasets mentioned:

1. For **ShuttleSet22**, the citation is:
   > Wei-Yao Wang, Wei-Wei Du, Wen-Chih Peng, and Tsi-Ui Ik. *Benchmarking Stroke Forecasting with Stroke-Level Badminton Dataset*. In Proceedings of the IJCAI, 2023.

2. For **BadmintonDB**, the citation is:
   > Kar-Weng Ban, John See, Junaidi Abdullah, and Yuen Peng Loh. *Badmintondb: A badminton dataset for player-specific match analysis and prediction*. In MMSports@MM, pages 47â€“54, ACM, 2022.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the necessary details for each dataset mentioned in the paper.
