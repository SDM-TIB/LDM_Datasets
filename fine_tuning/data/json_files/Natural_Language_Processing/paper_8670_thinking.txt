To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Compressing Cross-Lingual Multi-Task Models at Qualtrics" by Daniel Campos et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned or described. The abstract discusses the development of text analysis applications for experience management, which suggests that datasets are likely involved, but I need to find specific references.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experimental Results)**, where the authors describe their experimental setup. They mention that their dataset consists of internal customer experience data across multiple industries, which is a good indication that a dataset is being utilized. I will look for specific details about the dataset, such as the number of samples, languages, and any labeling information.

In this section, the authors specify that the dataset includes:
- **257,000 text documents across 16 languages** labeled for Task-1.
- **127,000 text documents across 12 languages** labeled for Task-2 and Task-3.

This gives me a clear understanding of the dataset's size and scope.

I will also check the **References section** to find any citations related to the datasets used. However, since the dataset is described as internal and anonymized, it may not have a formal citation like publicly available datasets. Instead, I will note that it is an internal dataset used with permission, which is important for understanding its context.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring to include the details about the dataset and its context. The full citation for the paper itself will also be noted for reference.

The citation for the paper is:
> Daniel Campos, Daniel Perry, Samir Joshi, Yashmeet Gambhir, Wei Du, Zhengzheng Xing, and Aaron Colak. *Compressing Cross-Lingual Multi-Task Models at Qualtrics*. Preprint, November 30, 2022.

I will summarize the dataset information as follows:
- **Dataset Name**: Internal Customer Experience Dataset
- **Description**: A collection of anonymized and aggregated customer experience data across multiple industries.
- **Size**: 257,000 text documents across 16 languages for Task-1; 127,000 text documents across 12 languages for Task-2 and Task-3.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare to format it according to the specified requirements for downstream processing.
