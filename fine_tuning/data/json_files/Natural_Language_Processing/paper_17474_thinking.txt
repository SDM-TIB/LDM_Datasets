To extract datasets from the research paper titled "EcomGPT-CT: Continual Pre-training of E-commerce Large Language Models with Semi-structured Data" by Shirong Ma et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned or hinted at. The abstract discusses the continual pre-training of LLMs using E-commerce data, which suggests that datasets related to E-commerce are likely included.

Next, I will examine the **section 3 (Domain-specific Continual Pre-training)**, particularly **subsection 3.2 (Dataset Construction)**, where the authors describe the datasets they have curated for their experiments. Here, they mention two main types of datasets:

1. **E-commerce Corpora**: This includes product titles, properties, descriptions, and reviews collected from Amazon and Taobao, as well as articles from the Guangguang channel of Taobao. This indicates a substantial dataset derived from real-world E-commerce platforms.

2. **General Corpora**: The authors specify that they sampled texts from WuDaoCorpora and RefinedWeb, which consist of a large volume of Chinese and English text data.

In the **table 1** presented in the paper, the authors summarize the processed datasets, providing token counts and features for each dataset. This table will be crucial for extracting specific details about the datasets.

Now, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **WuDaoCorpora**, the citation is:
  > Yuan, L., et al. (2021). *WudaoCorpora: A super large-scale Chinese corpora for pre-training language models*. AI Open, 2:65â€“68.

- For **RefinedWeb**, the citation is:
  > Penedo, G., et al. (2023). *The refined-web dataset for falcon llm: outperforming curated corpora with web data, and web data only*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2306.01116.

- For the **E-commerce data from Amazon and Taobao**, while specific citations may not be provided, I will note that these datasets are derived from publicly accessible platforms.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research, ready for further processing or review.
