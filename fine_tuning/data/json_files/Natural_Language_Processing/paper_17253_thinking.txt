To extract datasets from the research paper titled "AEDFL: Efficient Asynchronous Decentralized Federated Learning with Heterogeneous Devices" by Ji Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that extensive experimentation was conducted on four public datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed present. I will note this and look for specific names in the subsequent sections.

Next, I will examine **section 6 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they explicitly mention the datasets utilized:

1. **Emnist-letters (Emnist)**: This dataset is an extension of the MNIST dataset, specifically designed for handwritten letters. It is commonly used for character recognition tasks.

2. **CIFAR-10 (CIFAR)**: A well-known dataset consisting of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes, widely used for image classification tasks.

3. **Tiny-ImageNet**: A smaller version of the ImageNet dataset, containing 100,000 images across 200 classes, also used for image classification.

4. **IMDb dataset**: A dataset used for sentiment analysis, containing movie reviews labeled as positive or negative.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for the datasets used in the experiments.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **Emnist-letters**:
  > Cohen, G., Afshar, S., Tapson, J., & Van Schaik, A. (2017). Emnist: Extending mnist to handwritten letters. In *International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)*, IEEE, 2921–2926.

- For **CIFAR-10**:
  > Krizhevsky, A., & Hinton, G. (2009). Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images. Technical report, University of Toronto.

- For **Tiny-ImageNet**:
  > Le, Y., & Yang, X. (2015). Tiny imagenet visual recognition challenge. CS 231N, 7(2015), 3.

- For **IMDb dataset**:
  > Maas, A. L., Daly, E., Pham, P. T., Huang, D. S., Ng, A. Y., & Potts, C. (2011). Learning word vectors for sentiment analysis. In *Proceedings of the 49th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies*, 142–150.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or processing. This will ensure that all relevant details are captured accurately and can be referenced appropriately in future work.
