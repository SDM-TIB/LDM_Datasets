To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Non-contact Multimodal Indoor Human Monitoring Systems: A Survey" by Le Ngu Nguyen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract provides a general overview of the paper's focus on multimodal approaches for indoor human monitoring, which suggests that datasets may be discussed in detail later.

Next, I will examine the **sections that discuss specific tasks and methodologies**, particularly focusing on any subsections that mention datasets used for experiments or evaluations. For instance, in the introduction, the authors discuss various sensors and their applications, which may lead to the identification of specific datasets.

I will pay close attention to any **tables or figures** that summarize datasets or provide comparative analyses, as these often contain crucial information about the datasets used in the studies reviewed.

As I progress through the paper, I will look for explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, descriptions, and any relevant details such as the number of subjects, types of data collected, and the context of their use. 

Once I identify the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is critical, as proper citation is essential for academic integrity and allows others to locate the original sources.

For example, if I find a dataset like the **Berkeley MHAD**, I will note the citation:
> Ofli, F., Chaudhry, R., Kurillo, G., Vidal, R., & Bajcsy, R. (2013). *Berkeley MHAD: A comprehensive multimodal human action database*. In IEEE Workshop on Applications of Computer Vision.

Similarly, I will do this for any other datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring I capture the complete citation details.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, into a structured format for easy reference and further analysis.

By following this methodical approach, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document all relevant datasets from the research paper.
