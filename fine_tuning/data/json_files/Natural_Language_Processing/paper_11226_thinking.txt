To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Adaptive Vague Preference Policy Learning for Multi-round Conversational Recommendation" by Gangyi Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments on four diverse real-world datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed present in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the methodology or experiments sections. In this paper, the authors provide a **table (Table 1)** that summarizes the statistics of the datasets used, which is a good indication that I can find detailed information about each dataset there.

The datasets mentioned in the paper are:

1. **Yelp Dataset**: This dataset is used for business recommendations and includes 27,675 users, 70,311 items, and 1,368,609 interactions. The dataset has 590 attributes and 29 attribute types.

2. **LastFM Dataset**: This dataset is utilized for music artist recommendations, containing 98,576 users, 3 items, and 2,533,827 interactions. It has 8,438 attributes and 34 attribute types.

3. **Amazon-Book Dataset**: This dataset is widely used for product recommendations, featuring 1,801 users, 7,432 items, and 76,693 interactions. It includes 8,438 attributes and 34 attribute types.

4. **MovieLens Dataset**: This dataset is used for movie ratings and consists of 17,671 users, 4 items, and 228,217 interactions. It has 988 attributes and 40 attribute types.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are typically provided in the references, and I will ensure to include them in my extraction.

- For the **Yelp Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yelp. *Yelp Dataset Challenge*. [https://www.yelp.com/dataset](https://www.yelp.com/dataset).

- For the **LastFM Dataset**, the citation is:
  > LastFM. *HETREC 2011 Dataset*. [https://grouplens.org/datasets/hetrec-2011/](https://grouplens.org/datasets/hetrec-2011/).

- For the **Amazon-Book Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Amazon. *Amazon Product Dataset*. [http://jmcauley.ucsd.edu/data/amazon](http://jmcauley.ucsd.edu/data/amazon).

- For the **MovieLens Dataset**, the citation is:
  > MovieLens. *MovieLens 20M Dataset*. [https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/).

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described with its relevant statistics and full citation. This structured approach will help in accurately extracting and documenting the datasets used in the research paper.
