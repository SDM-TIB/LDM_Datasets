To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Environment-Invariant Curriculum Relation Learning for Fine-Grained Scene Graph Generation" by Yukuan Min et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that experiments were conducted on the **VG (Visual Genome)** and **GQA (Generalized Question Answering)** datasets, which suggests these are the primary datasets used in the research.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of these datasets in the **introduction**. The authors discuss the challenges in scene graph generation and reference the VG dataset, noting its extensive object and predicate categories. They also mention the GQA dataset as a benchmark for vision-language tasks, confirming their relevance to the study.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide more details about the datasets. They specify that the VG dataset comprises 75,000 object categories and 40,000 predicate categories, and they use the top 150 object categories and 50 predicate categories for their experiments. For the GQA dataset, they mention selecting the top 200 object classes and 100 predicate classes based on frequency for the GQA200 benchmark.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. **Visual Genome (VG) Dataset**:
   > Ranjay Krishna, Yuke Zhu, Oliver Groth, Justin Johnson, Kenji Hata, Joshua Kravitz, Stephanie Chen, Yannis Kalandidis, Li-Jia Li, David A Shamma, et al. *Visual Genome: Connecting language and vision using crowdsourced dense image annotations*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 123:32–73, 2017.

2. **GQA Dataset**:
   > Drew A Hudson and Christopher D Manning. *GQA: A new dataset for real-world visual reasoning and compositional question answering*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 6700–6709, 2019.

Having identified the datasets and their citations, I will now compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
