To extract datasets from the research paper titled "User Intent Recognition and Semantic Cache Optimization-Based Query Processing Framework Using CFLIS and MGR-LAU" by Sakshi Mahendru, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the work, but the details about datasets are likely to be found in the methodology or results sections.

In the **introduction**, the author discusses the importance of query processing and mentions various techniques but does not specify any datasets. Therefore, I will move on to the **methodology** section.

In the **methodology**, particularly in the **Dataset Description** subsection, the author explicitly mentions the **CISI dataset**. The description states that it contains 1,460 documents with unique IDs, titles, authors, abstracts, and cross-references, along with 112 queries and a mapping file linking query IDs to document IDs. This dataset is crucial for the proposed work as it serves as the "ground truth" for efficient information retrieval.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the CISI dataset. The dataset is sourced from Kaggle, and the paper provides a link to it. The citation for the dataset is as follows:

- **CISI Dataset**: 
  > D. Maso. *CISI: A Dataset for Information Retrieval*. Kaggle. Available at: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dmaso01dsta/cisi-a-dataset-for-information-retrieval?select=CISI.REL

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use.

In summary, the steps I took were:
1. Read through the abstract and introduction for initial context.
2. Focus on the methodology section to find explicit mentions of datasets.
3. Identify the CISI dataset and its details.
4. Retrieve the full citation from the references.

This systematic approach ensures that I accurately capture the necessary information regarding datasets used in the research paper.
