To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fuzzy Approach for Audio-Video Emotion Recognition in Computer Games for Children" by Pavel Kozlova et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors use the **FER dataset** for facial emotion detection and several audio datasets for emotion recognition, which suggests that multiple datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, specifically subsections 2.1 and 2.2, where the authors describe the datasets in detail. In subsection 2.1, they mention the **FER 2013 dataset**, which contains 35,887 black-and-white images of faces categorized into seven emotional states. This dataset is crucial for their facial emotion recognition task.

In subsection 2.2, the authors list multiple audio datasets used for emotion recognition:
1. **CREMA-D**: Contains 7,442 audio clips.
2. **TESS**: Comprises 2,800 audio files.
3. **RAVDESS**: Includes 1,440 audio files.
4. **Savee**: Contains 480 audio files.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. 

The citations I need to extract are as follows:

- For the **FER 2013 dataset**, the citation is:
  > Goodfellow, I.J., Erhan, D., Carrier, P.L., Courville, A., Mirza, M., Hamner, B., Cukierski, W., Tang, Y., Thaler, D., Lee, D.H., Zhou, Y., Ramaiah, C., Feng, F., Li, R., Wang, X., Athanasakis, D., Shawe-Taylor, J., Milakov, M., Park, J., Ionescu, R., Popescu, M., Grozea, C., Bergstra, J., Xie, J., Romaszko, L., Xu, B., Chuang, Z., Bengio, Y. (2013). Challenges in representation learning: A report on three machine learning contests. arXiv:1307.0414.

- For the **CREMA-D dataset**, the citation is:
  > Cao, H., Cooper, D.G., Keutmann, M.K., Gur, R.C., Nenkova, A., Verma, R. (2014). Crema-d: Crowd-sourced emotional multimodal actors dataset. IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing, 5(4), 377–390. doi:10.1109/TAFFC.2014.2336244.

- For the **TESS dataset**, the citation is:
  > Pichora-Fuller, M.K., Dupuis, K. (2020). Toronto emotional speech set (TESS). doi:10.5683/SP2/E8H2MF.

- For the **RAVDESS dataset**, the citation is:
  > Livingstone, S.R., Russo, F.A. (2019). Ravdess emotional speech audio. URL: https://www.kaggle.com/dsv/256618, doi:10.34740/KAGGLE/DSV/256618.

- For the **Savee dataset**, the citation is:
  > Haq, S., Jackson, P. (2009). Speaker-dependent audio-visual emotion recognition, in: Proc. Int. Conf. on Auditory-Visual Speech Processing (AVSP’08), Norwich, UK.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured all relevant datasets and their full citations as required.
