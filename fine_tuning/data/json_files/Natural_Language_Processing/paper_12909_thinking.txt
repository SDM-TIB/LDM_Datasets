To extract datasets from the research paper titled "High-Level Parallelism and Nested Features for Dynamic Inference Cost and Top-Down Attention" by André Kelm et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **experiments section (Section 4)**, the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for training and evaluation. I will focus on **Section 4.1 (Training and Datasets)**, where they detail the datasets chosen for their experiments.

The paper mentions the following datasets:

1. **Imagenette**: A subset of ImageNet containing 10 categories, which is useful for understanding how the model handles diverse categories.
2. **Imagewoof**: Another subset of ImageNet, but it contains breeds of dogs, which are more similar to each other, allowing for a different evaluation of the model's performance.
3. **ImageNet100**: A larger subset of ImageNet that includes 100 categories, providing a broader challenge for the model.
4. **ImageNet mini**: A smaller subset of ImageNet1k with only a few images per category, which tests the model's performance under high classification complexity.
5. **ImageNet1k**: The full ImageNet dataset, which serves as a comprehensive benchmark for image classification tasks.

Next, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **Imagenette**:
  > Jeremy Howard. *Imagenette*. https://github.com/fastai/imagenette/, 2020.

- For **Imagewoof**:
  > Jeremy Howard. *Imagewoof*. https://github.com/fastai/imagewoof/, 2020.

- For **ImageNet100**:
  > Kaggle. *Imagenet100*. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ambityga/imagenet100, 2020.

- For **ImageNet mini**:
  > Ilya Figotin. *Imagenet 1000 (mini)*. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ifigotin/imagenetmini-1000, Mar 2020.

- For **ImageNet1k**:
  > Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, and Li Fei-Fei. *ImageNet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In 2009 IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pages 248–255. IEEE, 2009.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or analysis.
