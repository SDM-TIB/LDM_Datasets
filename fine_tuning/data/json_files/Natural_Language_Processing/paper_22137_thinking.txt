To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Comprehensive Survey of Dynamic Graph Neural Networks: Models, Frameworks, Benchmarks, Experiments and Challenges" by ZhengZhao Feng et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and datasets section** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a general overview of the paper's focus but may not list specific datasets. The introduction may mention datasets in the context of dynamic GNN applications, which could guide me to specific sections later.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Dynamic GNN Benchmarks)**, which is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, the authors summarize various graph datasets, including their application domains, node and edge counts, timestamp ranges, and sizes. This section is crucial for identifying the datasets relevant to their experiments.

In **Table 2**, the authors provide a summary of commonly used graph datasets, which includes the following datasets:

1. **Reddit**: A social network dataset consisting of user posts on subreddits.
2. **DGraphFin**: A financial industry social network dataset.
3. **Enron**: An email dataset capturing interactions among Enron employees.
4. **Facebook**: A user interaction network.
5. **Social Evolution**: A dataset focusing on social relationship evolution.
6. **UCI**: An online community dataset from the University of California, Irvine.
7. **Wikipedia**: A bipartite interaction graph capturing user edits on Wikipedia pages.
8. **MOOC**: A dataset recording student behaviors in Massive Open Online Courses.
9. **ML25M**: A dataset containing user ratings of movies.
10. **LastFM**: A dataset providing information on user-listened songs.
11. **FB-FORUM**: A Facebook-like forum network dataset.
12. **DBLP**: An academic collaboration network dataset.
13. **Yelp**: A business review website dataset.
14. **ICEWS**: An event network dataset derived from news articles.
15. **GDELT**: Another event network dataset.
16. **Bitcoin-OTC**: A trust network of bitcoin users.
17. **Bitcoin-Alpha**: Another bitcoin user trust network.
18. **AS-733**: A communication network dataset.
19. **Flights**: A transportation map dataset.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. The references may provide the original sources or papers where these datasets were introduced or described in detail.

For example, the citation for the **Reddit dataset** might look like:
> Anon. 2022. The Reddit datasets. Retrieved April 28, 2024 from http://snap.stanford.edu/jodie.

Similarly, I will extract citations for the other datasets mentioned in the table.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes its full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their details from the paper effectively.
