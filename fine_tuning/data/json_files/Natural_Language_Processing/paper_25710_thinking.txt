To extract datasets from the research paper titled "M4: Multi-Proxy Multi-Gate Mixture of Experts Network for Multiple Instance Learning in Histopathology Image Analysis" by Junyu Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the M4 model was evaluated on five TCGA datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Dataset Description and Evaluation Details)**, where the authors provide specific details about the datasets used. Here, they mention that the datasets were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and include:

1. **GBMLGG (Glioblastoma and Lower-Grade Glioma)**: This dataset consists of 1022 slides.
2. **BRCA (Breast Cancer)**: This dataset includes 1001 slides.
3. **CRC (Colorectal Cancer)**: This dataset has 574 slides.
4. **UCEC (Uterine Corpus Endometrial Carcinoma)**: This dataset contains 567 slides.
5. **LUAD (Lung Adenocarcinoma)**: This dataset comprises 529 slides.

The authors also mention that the mutation status of the top 10 genes with the highest mutation counts was included in the datasets.

To ensure I have the correct citations, I will check the **References section** of the paper for any specific papers or sources that describe these datasets. However, since TCGA is a well-known resource, I can provide a general citation for it:

- For **The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)**, the citation is:
  > The Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network. *The Cancer Genome Atlas Pan-Cancer Analysis Project*. Nature Genetics, 2013.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required.

In summary, I will extract the following datasets:
1. **GBMLGG**: 1022 slides from TCGA.
2. **BRCA**: 1001 slides from TCGA.
3. **CRC**: 574 slides from TCGA.
4. **UCEC**: 567 slides from TCGA.
5. **LUAD**: 529 slides from TCGA.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its citation.
