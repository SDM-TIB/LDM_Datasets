To extract datasets from the research paper titled "How Do Language Models Bind Entities in Context?" by Jiahai Feng and Jacob Steinhardt, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will look for any references to datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. I will look for specific names of datasets, their descriptions, and any relevant details such as the number of instances, types of tasks, or characteristics that define them.

In this paper, the authors mention several tasks, including the **CAPITALS task**, **PARALLEL task**, **FRUITS task**, **SHAPES task**, and **BIOS task**. Each of these tasks is associated with specific datasets or contexts that are used for evaluation. I will extract the relevant details for each task:

1. **CAPITALS Task**: This task involves a dataset constructed from one-token names and country-capital pairs. The context format is specified, and the task requires the model to answer questions based on this context.

2. **PARALLEL Task**: Similar to the CAPITALS task, but with a different context format that breaks the confounder of entities appearing in the same sentence as attributes.

3. **FRUITS Task**: This task uses a set of common fruits and food items as attributes, with a similar context format to the CAPITALS task.

4. **SHAPES Task**: This task involves colors as entities and shapes as attributes, with a context format that inverts the typical noun-adjective structure.

5. **BIOS Task**: This task uses a dataset adapted from the bias in bios dataset, where the attributes are longer descriptions rather than single tokens.

After identifying these tasks, I will check the **References section** for any citations related to the datasets. If the datasets are derived from existing works, I will ensure to include the original citations.

For example, if the authors reference the **bias in bios dataset**, I will look for the original paper that introduced this dataset and include its citation.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation for each dataset used in the paper. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets referenced in the research.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets from the paper, maintaining a focus on clarity and completeness in the citations.
