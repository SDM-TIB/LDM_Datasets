To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Point Cloud Mamba: Point Cloud Learning via State Space Model" by Tao Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the research focus and any datasets that may be referenced. In the abstract, the authors mention that their method achieves state-of-the-art performance on several datasets, which indicates that specific datasets are likely discussed later in the paper.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names and descriptions. The authors state that they conducted experiments on four datasets: **ScanObjectNN**, **ModelNet40**, **ShapeNetPart**, and **S3DIS**. Each dataset is likely to have specific characteristics and details that I need to capture.

I will then check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets. 

1. **ScanObjectNN**: This dataset is described as a challenging point cloud classification dataset containing 15,000 real scanned objects categorized into 13 classes. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Uy, M.A., Pham, Q.H., Hua, B.S., Nguyen, T., Yeung, S.K. "Revisiting point cloud classification: A new benchmark dataset and classification model on real-world data." In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2019.

2. **ModelNet40**: This dataset consists of 40 categories, each with 100 unique CAD models. The citation is:
   > Wu, Z., Song, S., Khosla, A., Yu, F., Zhang, L., Tang, X., Xiao, J. "3D ShapeNets: A deep representation for volumetric shapes." In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2015.

3. **ShapeNetPart**: This dataset is used for 3D object part segmentation and comprises 16,880 models from 16 different shape categories and 50 part labels. The citation is:
   > Yi, L., Kim, V.G., Ceylan, D., Shen, I.C., Yan, M., Su, H., Lu, C., Huang, Q., Sheffer, A., Guibas, L. "A scalable active framework for region annotation in 3D shape collections." ACM Transactions on Graphics (TOG), 2016.

4. **S3DIS**: This is a large-scale indoor point cloud benchmark containing 6 large indoor areas, 271 rooms, and 13 semantic categories. The citation is:
   > Armeni, I., Sener, O., Zamir, A.R., Jiang, H., Brilakis, I., Fischer, M., Savarese, S. "3D semantic parsing of large-scale indoor spaces." In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2016.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research and their significance in the context of the study.

Finally, I will prepare the structured output for each dataset, ensuring that all necessary details are included for clarity and reference.
