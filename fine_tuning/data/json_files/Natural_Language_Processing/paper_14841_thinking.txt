To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Hybrid System Stability Analysis of Multi-Lane Mixed-Autonomy Traffic" by Sirui Li, Roy Dong, and Cathy Wu, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the potential of autonomous vehicles (AVs) in traffic systems but does not explicitly mention datasets. The introduction may provide insights into empirical studies or simulations that could reference datasets.

Next, I will look for a **dedicated section on datasets or experiments**. In this paper, there is no explicit section titled "Datasets," but the authors mention numerical analysis and simulations throughout the paper. I will focus on sections that describe the experiments, particularly any references to data used for simulations or validation.

In the **experiments section**, the authors describe the setup for their simulations, including parameters and models used. They reference a field experiment and simulations based on the Optimal Velocity Model (OVM). However, they do not provide specific datasets or their sources.

I will also check the **references section** for any cited datasets or studies that may have provided data for their analysis. The references include various studies on traffic flow, autonomous vehicles, and control systems, but again, they do not specify datasets directly.

Since the paper does not provide explicit datasets, I will summarize the relevant studies mentioned that could potentially be sources of data:

1. **Field Experiment on AVs**: The authors reference a field experiment that demonstrates the stabilization of traffic flow by a single AV. However, they do not provide a specific dataset citation.

2. **Simulations Based on OVM**: The paper discusses simulations using the Optimal Velocity Model, which is a common model in traffic studies. While it does not cite a specific dataset, it implies the use of simulation data generated from this model.

3. **Cited Studies**: The references include various studies that may have datasets related to traffic flow and AVs. For example:
   - R. E. Stern et al. (2018) discusses the dissipation of stop-and-go waves via control of AVs, which may have associated datasets.
   - Y. Zheng et al. (2020) on smoothing traffic flow via control of AVs could also be a source of relevant data.

Now, I will compile the information regarding the datasets and their citations:

- **Field Experiment**: While not explicitly cited, the authors refer to a field experiment demonstrating AV stabilization.
- **Simulations**: Based on the Optimal Velocity Model, but no specific dataset is provided.
- **Cited Studies**:
  - R. E. Stern, S. Cui, M. L. Delle Monache, R. Bhadani, M. Bunting et al. "Dissipation of stop-and-go waves via control of autonomous vehicles: Field experiments," *Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies*, vol. 89, pp. 205–221, 2018.
  - Y. Zheng, J. Wang, and K. Li. "Smoothing traffic flow via control of autonomous vehicles," *IEEE Internet of Things Journal*, vol. 7, no. 5, pp. 3882–3896, 2020.

In conclusion, while the paper does not provide explicit datasets, it references studies and experiments that could be explored for relevant data. I will summarize these findings in a structured format for clarity.
