To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MMSci: A Multimodal Multi-Discipline Dataset for PhD-Level Scientific Comprehension" by Zekun Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to gather initial insights about the datasets. The abstract mentions the creation of a multimodal, multidisciplinary dataset from open-access scientific articles, which indicates that a dataset is indeed present.

Next, I will focus on the **data collection and dataset description sections**. Here, the authors provide detailed information about the dataset, including its scope, the number of articles and figures, and the scientific disciplines covered. Specifically, I will look for any explicit mentions of the dataset name, its purpose, and how it was constructed.

In the **data curation section**, the authors describe the dataset MMSci, which consists of high-quality, peer-reviewed articles and figures from Nature Communications. They mention that the dataset spans 72 scientific disciplines and includes various tasks for evaluating models' understanding of scientific content. This confirms that MMSci is the primary dataset of interest.

I will also check the **appendix and references sections** for any additional datasets or related works that may be cited. The references may provide full citations for the datasets mentioned, which is crucial for proper documentation.

The key dataset identified is:

1. **MMSci Dataset**: A multimodal, multi-discipline dataset containing high-quality, open-access articles and figures from Nature Communications, covering 72 scientific disciplines.

Now, I will compile the full citation for the MMSci dataset based on the information provided in the paper. The citation is as follows:

> Zekun Li, HyeonJung Kim, Xianjun Yang, Kyuri Choi, Jin Hyuk Lim, Sungyoung Ji, Linda Ruth Petzold, Stephen D. Wilson, Woosang Lim, Wanrong Zhu, Ryan Hsieh, Byungju Lee, Xifeng Yan, William Yang Wang. *MMSci: A Multimodal Multi-Discipline Dataset for PhD-Level Scientific Comprehension*. In Proceedings of the Nature Communications, 2024. URL: https://github.com/Leezekun/MMSci.

After gathering this information, I will ensure that the dataset entry is formatted correctly and ready for inclusion in any structured output or documentation.
