To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Traj-LLM: A New Exploration for Empowering Trajectory Prediction with Pre-trained Large Language Models" by Zhengxing Lan et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of LLMs for trajectory prediction but does not specify any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine **section V (Experiments)**, where the authors mention the **nuScenes dataset** as the benchmark for evaluating their model. This section provides details about the dataset, including its characteristics and the context in which it is used for trajectory prediction.

In the **experimental setup**, the authors describe the nuScenes dataset as covering 1,000 driving scenarios collected via vehicle-mounted cameras and lidar sensors, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's relevance to their research.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the nuScenes dataset. The citation is as follows:
> H. Caesar, V. Bankiti, A. H. Lang, S. Vora, V. E. Liong, Q. Xu, A. Krishnan, Y. Pan, G. Baldan, and O. Beijbom. *nuscenes: A multimodal dataset for autonomous driving*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, 2020, pp. 11 621â€“11 631.

Since the paper primarily discusses the nuScenes dataset, I will create an entry for it.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This will ensure that the dataset is accurately represented and properly cited for future reference.
