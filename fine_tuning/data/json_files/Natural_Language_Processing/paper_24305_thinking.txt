To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Framing Social Movements on Social Media: Unpacking Diagnostic, Prognostic, and Motivational Strategies" by Julia Mendelsohn et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and data sections** of the paper to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the creation of a **codebook, annotated dataset, and computational models**, indicating that datasets are a key component of the research.

Next, I will focus on the **data collection section**, where the authors describe their dataset in detail. They mention analyzing a dataset of **1.85 million tweets** related to three social movement issues: guns, immigration, and LGBTQ rights, collected from the Twitter Decahose 10% sample from 2018-2019. This is a significant dataset that I need to document.

The authors also reference the work of **Bozarth and Budak (2022)**, which provides the foundational dataset for their analysis. I will ensure to include this citation as it is crucial for proper attribution.

In addition, I will look for any other datasets mentioned in the **methodology or results sections**. The authors discuss their **manual annotation of a sample of 6,000 tweets** for relevance and framing strategies, which is another dataset that should be noted.

Now, I will compile the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. **Dataset of 1.85 million tweets**:
   > Bozarth, L., & Budak, C. (2022). Keyword expansion techniques for mining social movement data on social media. *EPJ Data Science*, 11(1), 30. https://doi.org/10.1140/epjds/s13688-022-00300-0

2. **Annotated dataset of 6,000 tweets**:
   - This dataset is part of the authors' own work and does not have a separate citation, but it is derived from the larger dataset mentioned above.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets in a clear format, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will facilitate further analysis or use by other researchers interested in the findings of this paper.
