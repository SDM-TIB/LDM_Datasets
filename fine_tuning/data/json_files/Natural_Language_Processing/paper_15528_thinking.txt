To extract datasets from the research paper titled "LightSAGE: Graph Neural Networks for Large Scale Item Retrieval in Shopee’s Advertisement Recommendation" by Dang Minh Nguyen et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the work, but I will focus on sections that typically contain detailed information about datasets.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of item retrieval in e-commerce and mention the use of user behavior data. However, they do not specify any datasets at this point.

Next, I will examine the **methodology section**, particularly the parts discussing graph construction and model training. Here, the authors describe the data used for training their model, specifically mentioning that they used real user behavior data collected from the Shopee app. They state that the training data involves "30 million unique users, 30 million unique products, and 3 billion clicks." This indicates a large-scale dataset derived from Shopee's user interactions, but it lacks a formal dataset name.

Moving to the **experiments section**, the authors mention conducting offline evaluations using the same user behavior data. They specify that the data was collected over a 30-day period from February to March 2023, but again, no formal dataset name is provided.

Since the paper does not explicitly name any datasets, I will note the following key points about the dataset derived from the Shopee app:

1. **Shopee User Behavior Dataset**: This dataset consists of user interactions, including clicks, involving 30 million unique users and 30 million unique products over a period of 30 days. It is used for training the GNN model and evaluating its performance.

Next, I will check the **References section** to see if any external datasets are cited that might be relevant. The references primarily discuss algorithms and methodologies rather than specific datasets.

Since the paper does not provide formal citations for the user behavior dataset, I will create a citation entry based on the information available:

- For the **Shopee User Behavior Dataset**, I will cite it as follows:
  > Dang Minh Nguyen, Chenfei Wang, Yan Shen, and Yifan Zeng. 2023. Shopee User Behavior Dataset. In *LightSAGE: Graph Neural Networks for Large Scale Item Retrieval in Shopee’s Advertisement Recommendation*. Seventeenth ACM Conference on Recommender Systems (RecSys ’23), September 18–22, 2023, Singapore, Singapore.

Now, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format for further processing. Since the paper does not provide multiple datasets, I will focus on this single dataset entry.
