To extract datasets from the research paper titled "TESTAM: A Time-Enhanced Spatio-Temporal Attention Model with Mixture of Experts" by Hyunwook Lee and Sungahn Ko, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on **three public traffic network datasets**: METR-LA, PEMS-BAY, and EXPY-TKY. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for the research.

Next, I will look for specific details about these datasets in the **experiments section**. The authors describe the datasets as follows:

1. **METR-LA**: This dataset contains four months of speed data recorded by 207 sensors on Los Angeles highways.
2. **PEMS-BAY**: This dataset includes four months of speed data from 325 sensors in the Bay Area.
3. **EXPY-TKY**: This dataset consists of three months of speed data collected from 1843 links in Tokyo, Japan.

The paper also provides information about the data collection intervals, with METR-LA and PEMS-BAY having 5-minute intervals and EXPY-TKY having 10-minute intervals.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **METR-LA**:
  > Yaguang Li, Rose Yu, Cyrus Shahabi, and Yan Liu. *Diffusion convolutional recurrent neural network: Data-driven traffic forecasting*. In International Conference on Learning Representations, 2018.

- For **PEMS-BAY**:
  > Yaguang Li and Cyrus Shahabi. *A brief overview of machine learning methods for short-term traffic forecasting and future directions*. SIGSPATIAL Special, 10(1):3â€“9, 2018.

- For **EXPY-TKY**:
  > Hyunwook Lee, Seungmin Jin, Hyeshin Chu, Hongkyu Lim, and Sungahn Ko. *Learning to remember patterns: Pattern matching memory networks for traffic forecasting*. In International Conference on Learning Representations, 2022.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that highlights each dataset's name, description, and citation. This will ensure that I have a clear and organized representation of the datasets used in the research paper.
