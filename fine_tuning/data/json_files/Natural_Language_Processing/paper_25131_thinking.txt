To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ARCO: Adaptive Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning-Based Hardware/Software Co-Optimization Compiler for Improved Performance in DNN Accelerator Design" by Mehdi Kamal et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a high-level overview, but specific datasets are often detailed in the introduction or results sections.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the computational demands of deep neural networks (DNNs) and mention various frameworks but do not explicitly name any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look further into the paper.

Next, I will examine **section 4 (Experimental Results)**, where the authors describe their experimental setup. They mention evaluating ARCO on a suite of advanced deep-learning models, specifically listing the models used for comparison, which include:

1. **AlexNet**
2. **VGG-11**
3. **VGG-13**
4. **VGG-16**
5. **VGG-19**
6. **ResNet-18**
7. **ResNet-34**

The paper states that all models were benchmarked using the **ImageNet** dataset. This is a well-known dataset in the field of deep learning, particularly for image classification tasks.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citation for the ImageNet dataset. The citation for ImageNet is typically:

> Olga Russakovsky, Jia Deng, Hao Sheng, et al. *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 115(3):211-252, 2015.

Having identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the findings:

1. **Dataset Name**: ImageNet
   - **Description**: A large-scale dataset used for image classification tasks, containing millions of labeled images across thousands of categories.
   - **Citation**: Olga Russakovsky, Jia Deng, Hao Sheng, et al. *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 115(3):211-252, 2015.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or processing.
