To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Studying the Impact of Stochasticity on the Evaluation of Deep Neural Networks for Forest-Fire Prediction" by Harshit Kumar et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the paper discusses a synthetic forest-fire dataset created using cellular automata-based models, which suggests that there is at least one dataset to extract.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **introduction**. The authors mention the use of a real-world wildfire dataset, specifically the **Next Day Wildfire Spread dataset**, which consolidates historical wildfire incidents with various observational variables. This is a clear indication of a dataset that needs to be documented.

In the **methodology section**, the authors provide details about the Next Day Wildfire Spread dataset, including its characteristics. They mention that it contains 18,545 wildfire events and provides sequential snapshots of fire spread, captured at time \( t \) and \( t + 1 \) day. This information is crucial for describing the dataset.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the Next Day Wildfire Spread dataset. The authors cite the following paper for this dataset:

- **Next Day Wildfire Spread Dataset**:
  > Huot, F., Hu, R. L., Goyal, N., Sankar, T., Ihme, M., & Chen, Y.-F. (2022). Next Day Wildfire Spread: A Machine Learning Dataset to Predict Wildfire Spreading From Remote-Sensing Data. *IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing*, 60, 1â€“13. https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2022.3192974

Now, I will compile the information about the datasets into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required.

In summary, the key datasets extracted from the paper are:

1. **Synthetic Forest-Fire Dataset**: Created using cellular automata-based models to simulate a wide spectrum of outcomes.
2. **Next Day Wildfire Spread Dataset**: Contains historical wildfire incidents with observational variables.

I will ensure that the full citations for these datasets are included in the final output.
