To extract datasets from the research paper titled "StoryDB: Broad Multi-language Narrative Dataset" by Alexey Tikhonov et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract introduces StoryDB as a broad multi-language dataset of narratives, indicating that this is the primary dataset discussed in the paper.

Next, I will examine the **Data** section, which provides detailed information about StoryDB. Here, the authors describe the structure of the dataset, including the number of languages, the number of stories per language, and the indexing system used. They mention that the dataset consists of stories extracted from Wikipedia articles that contain plot summaries in various languages.

In the **Evaluation** section, the authors discuss how they benchmarked StoryDB using three modern multilanguage models (mDistillBERT, mBERT, and XLM-RoBERTa), but they do not introduce any new datasets here. Instead, they focus on the application of StoryDB in evaluating these models.

The **Discussion** and **Conclusion** sections reiterate the significance of StoryDB as a multi-language narrative dataset but do not introduce additional datasets.

Now, I will compile the information regarding the primary dataset:

1. **StoryDB**: This is the main dataset discussed in the paper. It includes narratives in 42 different languages, with over 500 stories per language, and some languages containing more than 20,000 stories. The dataset is indexed across languages and tagged with genres and topics.

Next, I will locate the full citation for the StoryDB dataset. The authors do not provide a separate citation for StoryDB in the references, but they do mention that the dataset is constructed from Wikipedia articles. Therefore, I will cite the paper itself as the source of the dataset:

- For **StoryDB**, the citation is:
  > Alexey Tikhonov, Igor Samenko, and Ivan P. Yamshchikov. *StoryDB: Broad Multi-language Narrative Dataset*. In Proceedings of the [Conference Name], [Year]. [Additional details if available].

Since the paper does not specify a conference name or year in the provided text, I will note that this information needs to be filled in based on the actual publication details.

Finally, I will summarize the dataset entry for StoryDB, ensuring that I have captured all necessary details and citations accurately.
