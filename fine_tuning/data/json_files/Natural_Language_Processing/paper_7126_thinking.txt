To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Pre-training Enhanced Spatial-temporal Graph Neural Network for Multivariate Time Series Forecasting" by Zezhi Shao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that experiments were conducted on three public real-world datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they list three datasets:

1. **METR-LA**: This dataset is described as a traffic speed dataset collected from loop detectors in the LA County road network, containing data from 207 sensors over a period of 4 months, with a sample rate of every 5 minutes.

2. **PEMS-BAY**: This dataset is collected from the California Transportation Agencies' Performance Measurement System, containing data from 325 sensors in the Bay Area over a period of 6 months, also with a sample rate of every 5 minutes.

3. **PEMS04**: Another traffic flow dataset from the California Transportation Agencies, containing data from 307 sensors in the Bay Area over a period of 2 months, recorded at the same 5-minute interval.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. The authors cite the sources for the datasets as follows:

- For **METR-LA**, the citation is:
  > Chao Chen, Karl Petty, Alexander Skabardonis, Pravin Varaiya, and Zhanfeng Jia. *Freeway performance measurement system: mining loop detector data*. Transportation Research Record, 2001.

- For **PEMS-BAY**, the citation is:
  > Chao Chen, Karl Petty, Alexander Skabardonis, Pravin Varaiya, and Zhanfeng Jia. *Freeway performance measurement system: mining loop detector data*. Transportation Research Record, 2001.

- For **PEMS04**, the citation is:
  > Zheng Lu, Chen Zhou, Jing Wu, Hao Jiang, and Songyue Cui. *Integrating Granger Causality and Vector Auto-Regression for Traffic Prediction of Large-Scale WLANs*. KSII Transactions on Internet and Information Systems, 2016.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that highlights each dataset's name, description, and full citation. This will ensure that I have a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
