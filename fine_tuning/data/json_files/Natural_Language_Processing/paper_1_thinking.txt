To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Dynamic Network Model from Partial Observations" by Elahe Ghalebi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the effectiveness of the proposed framework using "extensive experiments on synthetic as well as real-world networks," which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors mention the application of their method to "Twitter and MemeTracker datasets" for diffusion prediction and predicting influential nodes. This indicates that these datasets are relevant to their experiments.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide details about the datasets used. They specifically mention:

1. **Twitter Dataset**: This dataset contains the diffusion of URLs on Twitter during 2010, with a network consisting of 6,126 nodes and 12,045 edges, and 5,106 cascades of an average length of 17.

2. **Memes Dataset**: This dataset includes the diffusion of memes from March 2011 to February 2012 over online news websites, consisting of 5,000 nodes and 313,669 edges, with 54,847 cascades of an average length of 14.

3. **Financial Transaction Network Dataset**: This dataset is collected from a country’s transaction log for all transactions larger than 50K Euros over 10 years (2007-2017), including 1,197,116 transactions between 103,497 companies, with 2,765 companies labeled as bankrupted.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. However, since the datasets are derived from real-world applications, they may not have formal citations like traditional datasets. Instead, I will summarize the information provided in the paper.

The citations for the datasets will be as follows:

- **Twitter Dataset**: 
  > Hodas, N. O., & Lerman, K. (2013). The simple rules of social contagion. CoRR, abs/1308.5015.

- **Memes Dataset**: 
  > Leskovec, J., Backstrom, L., & Kleinberg, J. (2009). Meme-tracking and the dynamics of the news cycle. In Proceedings of the 15th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD ’09), pages 497–506.

- **Financial Transaction Network Dataset**: 
  > This dataset is based on transaction logs and does not have a specific citation but is referenced in the context of financial transactions and bankruptcy prediction.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
