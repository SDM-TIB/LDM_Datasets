To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Learning based Direct Segmentation Assisted by Deformable Image Registration for Cone-Beam CT based Auto-Segmentation for Adaptive Radiotherapy" by Xiao Liang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the challenges of deep learning-based segmentation due to the lack of well-labeled large training datasets, which suggests that datasets are crucial to the study.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly the subsection titled **2.5 Data**, where the authors describe the data collection process. Here, they mention that they collected data from **137 patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma**. This indicates that the dataset is related to medical imaging and segmentation tasks.

In this section, the authors provide details about the data, including:
- **3D pCT volumes** acquired before treatment, with manual contours delineated by radiation oncologists.
- **3D CBCT images** collected for the same patients.

The authors also specify that among the 137 patients, **39 had true segmentation labels on CBCT**. They list **19 structures** that were selected as segmentation targets, which include various organs and anatomical structures.

Now, I will compile the information about the datasets mentioned in the paper:

1. **Dataset of 137 Patients**: This dataset includes 3D pCT volumes and 3D CBCT images, with manual contours for 39 patients.
   - Citation: The paper does not provide a specific citation for this dataset, but it is derived from the authors' own research involving patient data.

2. **True Segmentation Labels Dataset**: This subset consists of the 39 patients with true segmentation labels on CBCT, specifically for the 19 structures mentioned.
   - Citation: Again, this dataset is part of the authors' research and does not have a separate citation.

Next, I will check the **references section** for any relevant citations related to the datasets used in the study. However, since the datasets are primarily derived from the authors' clinical work and do not correspond to publicly available datasets, there may not be formal citations for them.

Finally, I will summarize the datasets extracted from the paper, ensuring to note that while the datasets are crucial to the study, they are not formally cited as external datasets.

In conclusion, I will prepare the dataset entries based on the information gathered, ensuring to highlight the importance of the datasets in the context of the research while acknowledging the lack of formal citations for them.
