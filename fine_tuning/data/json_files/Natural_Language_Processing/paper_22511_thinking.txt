To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Scalable and Effective Arithmetic Tree Generation for Adder and Multiplier Designs" by Yao Lai et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly referenced. The abstract provides a high-level overview, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the work, which may include mentions of datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. I will look for any specific names of datasets, their characteristics, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

In this paper, the authors discuss the use of **Yosys** and **OpenROAD** tools for synthesis, but they do not explicitly mention any datasets in the context of training or evaluation. Instead, they focus on the design and performance metrics of their proposed methods. Therefore, I will note that while the paper discusses methodologies and results, it does not provide specific datasets that are publicly available or referenced.

Since there are no datasets mentioned in the paper, I will not need to look for citations. However, I will still summarize the findings regarding the absence of datasets.

Finally, I will compile my findings into a structured format, ensuring clarity in the documentation of the absence of datasets in this research paper.

In summary, the steps I took are:
1. Read the abstract, introduction, and experiments sections for mentions of datasets.
2. Focus on the experiments section for specific dataset details.
3. Note the absence of explicit datasets in the paper.
4. Prepare a summary of findings regarding datasets.

This approach ensures a thorough examination of the paper while adhering to the importance of documenting any datasets mentioned, even if none are found in this case.
