To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CEB: Compositional Evaluation Benchmark for Fairness in Large Language Models" by Song Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors collected a variety of datasets for bias evaluation of LLMs, which suggests that multiple datasets are involved.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **methodology and dataset construction sections**. In the paper, the authors describe the construction of the **CEB (Compositional Evaluation Benchmark)**, which includes several datasets. I will note down each dataset mentioned along with their descriptions.

From the text, I identify the following datasets:

1. **CEB-Recognition**: This dataset is designed for recognizing stereotypes and includes various social groups.
2. **CEB-Selection**: This dataset is used for selecting the more stereotypical option between two choices.
3. **CEB-Continuation**: This dataset is for generating continuations of prompts that may elicit biased responses.
4. **CEB-Conversation**: This dataset is for conversational prompts that may lead to biased responses.
5. **CEB-Adult**: A classification dataset that predicts whether an individual's income exceeds $50K based on demographic attributes.
6. **CEB-Credit**: A classification dataset that predicts whether a person will default on a credit payment.
7. **CEB-Jigsaw**: A dataset for predicting whether a comment is toxic or not.

Next, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The authors reference existing datasets that they have modified or built upon, such as:

- **BBQ Dataset**: Parrish et al. (2022). "BBQ: A hand-built bias benchmark for question answering." In Proceedings of the Association for Computational Linguistics.
- **HolisticBias Dataset**: Smith et al. (2022). "Finding new biases in language models with a holistic descriptor dataset." In Proceedings of the Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing.
- **Adult Dataset**: Dua et al. (2017). "UCI Machine Learning Repository."
- **Credit Dataset**: Yeh and Lien (2009). "The comparisons of data mining techniques for the predictive accuracy of probability of default of credit card clients." Expert Systems with Applications.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the datasets along with their full citations into a structured format for clarity and future reference. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets and their sources as intended by the authors.
