To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Are Cascade Dialogue State Tracking Models Speaking Out of Turn in Spoken Dialogues?" by Lucas Druart et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly referenced. The abstract discusses the analysis of errors in state-of-the-art systems and mentions the use of the **MultiWOZ dataset**, which is a strong indication that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Spoken Dialogue State Tracking)**, where the authors describe the **spoken version of MultiWOZ**. This section provides details about the dataset, including its structure and characteristics. The authors mention that the dataset contains close to 10,000 dialogues with a specific train-dev-test split, which is crucial information for dataset documentation.

In this section, I will note the following details about the **MultiWOZ dataset**:
- It is a human-human chat-based English task-oriented dialogue dataset.
- The spoken version includes vocalized user turns and is part of the "Speech Aware" track of DSTC11.
- The dataset is split into training, development, and test sets with an 80/10/10 ratio.
- The training set is only available as synthetic speech, while the dev and test sets are available as both synthetic and human speech.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the MultiWOZ dataset. The relevant citation is:
> Pawe≈Ç Budzianowski, Tsung-Hsien Wen, Bo-Hsiang Tseng, et al. *Multiwoz - a large-scale multi-domain wizard-of-oz dataset for task-oriented dialogue modelling*. In Proceedings of the EMNLP, 2018.

Since the paper primarily discusses the MultiWOZ dataset, I will focus on this dataset for extraction. I will compile the information into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and full citation.

After gathering all necessary details, I will prepare the dataset entry for the MultiWOZ dataset, ensuring that the citation is accurately represented for future reference or processing.
