To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-Intent Attribute-Aware Text Matching in Searching" by Mingzhe Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that extensive experiments were conducted on three real-world datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed present. I will look for specific names or descriptions of these datasets.

Next, I will navigate to **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors provide details about the datasets used. In this section, they present a table (Table 1) that summarizes the statistics of the datasets. I will carefully note the names and descriptions of each dataset mentioned:

1. **Amazon Dataset**: This dataset is used for query-item matching and consists of 1,818,825 query-item pairs, with specific training, validation, and test sizes.

2. **Alipay Query Rewriting Dataset**: This dataset includes rewritten query pairs, with a training dataset size of 1,253,757 and additional validation and test sizes.

3. **Alipay Query-Item Matching Dataset**: This dataset is also used for query-item matching, with 730,027 query-item pairs and specified training, validation, and test sizes.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations may not always be explicitly stated in the dataset descriptions, so I will look for any references that discuss the datasets in detail.

For the **Amazon Dataset**, the citation is:
> Chandan K. Reddy, Lluís Màrquez, Fran Valero, Nikhil Rao, Hugo Zaragoza, Sambaran Bandyopadhyay, Arnab Biswas, Anlu Xing, and Karthik Subbian. *Shopping Queries Dataset: A Large-Scale ESCI Benchmark for Improving Product Search*. arXiv:2206.06588, 2022.

For the **Alipay Query Rewriting Dataset** and **Alipay Query-Item Matching Dataset**, the paper does not provide specific citations, as they are collected from the Alipay App based on user interactions. However, I will note that they are proprietary datasets created for the study.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for the datasets that have them and provide a clear description for each dataset used in the experiments.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset information in a structured format for easy reference and further processing.
