To extract datasets from the research paper titled "BDIQA: A New Dataset for Video Question Answering to Explore Cognitive Reasoning through Theory of Mind" by Yuanyuan Mao et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract introduces BDIQA as a new benchmark for exploring cognitive reasoning in VideoQA, which indicates that this is the primary dataset discussed in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets**. In this paper, there is a section titled **"Dataset"** that provides detailed information about BDIQA. Here, the authors describe the dataset's structure, the number of videos, and the types of questions included. They mention that BDIQA consists of **3,527 videos** and **19,932 QA pairs**, which is crucial information for understanding the dataset's scope.

In the **"Dataset Construction"** subsection, the authors explain how they generated the videos using VirtualHome, which is important for understanding the dataset's context and methodology. They also provide insights into the types of questions included in BDIQA, such as belief, desire, and intention questions, which further characterizes the dataset.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the BDIQA dataset. The authors do not provide a separate citation for BDIQA since it is introduced in this paper. However, I will note that the dataset is part of the paper itself.

The citation for the paper, which serves as the citation for the BDIQA dataset, is:
> Yuanyuan Mao, Xin Lin, Qin Ni, Liang He. *BDIQA: A New Dataset for Video Question Answering to Explore Cognitive Reasoning through Theory of Mind*. In Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, 2024.

Finally, I will compile the information about the dataset into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation as required. The dataset entry will highlight the key aspects of BDIQA, including its purpose, structure, and the number of videos and QA pairs it contains.
