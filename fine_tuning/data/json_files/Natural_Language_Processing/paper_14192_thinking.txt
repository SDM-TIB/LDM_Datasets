To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Noise-in, Bias-out: Balanced and Real-time MoCap Solving" by Georgios Albanis et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often discusses the datasets used for training and evaluation.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention the challenges of sourcing training data and the reliance on various datasets for their experiments. This indicates that there are specific datasets that I need to look for.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used. The authors explicitly mention several datasets in the context of their experiments. I will take note of each dataset's name, description, and any relevant details provided.

The paper mentions the following datasets:

1. **AMASS Dataset**: This dataset is referenced as a unified source for various motion capture data, which includes data from multiple high-end MoCap systems. It is crucial for the authors' experiments.

2. **CMU MoCap Dataset**: A well-known dataset that contains a wide variety of motion types, which is used for training and evaluation.

3. **HumanEva Dataset**: This dataset includes various activities performed by multiple subjects and is also utilized in the experiments.

4. **THuman 2.0 Dataset**: A markerless dataset that includes data from subjects performing extreme poses, which is significant for the authors' approach.

5. **GeneBody Dataset**: This dataset consists of subjects performing various short-duration activities and is used in conjunction with other datasets.

6. **ZJU-MoCap Dataset**: Another markerless dataset that includes data from multiple sequences of human performances.

7. **ACCAD Dataset**: This dataset is mentioned as part of the evaluation process for the authors' model.

After identifying these datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets.

The citations I will look for include:

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
