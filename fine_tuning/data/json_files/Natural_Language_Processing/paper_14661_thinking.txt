To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Knolling Bot: Learning Robotic Object Arrangement from Tidy Demonstrations" by Yuhang Hu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses a self-supervised learning framework and mentions generating a diverse dataset of tidy arrangements, which suggests that there is a dataset involved.

Next, I will focus on the **Methodology section**, particularly the subsection titled **Data Representation and Generation**. Here, the authors describe how they generated a dataset of tidy arrangements through an optimization strategy, yielding **2.4 million demonstrations**. This is a significant dataset that I need to document.

I will also look for any specific names or references to existing datasets in the **Experiments section**. However, it appears that the primary dataset discussed is the one they generated themselves, rather than using pre-existing datasets.

Now, I will check the **References section** to see if there are any citations related to the dataset they created. Since the authors do not reference an external dataset but rather describe their own generation process, I will note that the dataset is original to this work.

The dataset can be summarized as follows:

1. **Tidy Arrangements Dataset**: This dataset consists of **2.4 million demonstrations** of tidy object arrangements generated through an optimization strategy. The dataset captures a wide variety of tidiness concepts and aesthetic preferences.

Since there are no external datasets cited in the paper, I will provide the citation for the paper itself as the source of the dataset:

- Hu, Y., Zhang, Z., Zhu, X., Liu, R., & Lipson, H. (2023). *Knolling Bot: Learning Robotic Object Arrangement from Tidy Demonstrations*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA).

Now, I will compile the dataset entry and its citation into a structured format for further processing.
