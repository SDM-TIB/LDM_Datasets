To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Neural Cache: Bit-Serial In-Cache Acceleration of Deep Neural Networks" by Charles Eckert et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly referenced. The abstract discusses the Neural Cache architecture and its performance improvements, but it does not mention specific datasets.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any references to datasets used for evaluation or comparison. The introduction primarily discusses the architecture and its significance in addressing memory latency issues but does not provide details about datasets.

I will then look into the **experiments or evaluation section** (if available) to identify any datasets used for testing the Neural Cache architecture. This section is crucial as it typically contains information about the datasets employed in the experiments. However, in this paper, the focus is more on the architecture and its performance metrics rather than specific datasets.

After reviewing the paper, it appears that there are no explicit datasets mentioned for training or testing purposes. The paper discusses the performance of the Neural Cache architecture using the Inception v3 model but does not provide a dataset citation.

Since no datasets are identified in the paper, I will not be able to provide full citations for datasets as there are none referenced. If there were datasets mentioned, I would have looked for the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset, ensuring to include the authors, title, publication venue, and year.

In conclusion, I will summarize that the paper does not provide specific datasets for evaluation, and therefore, no dataset citations can be extracted.
