To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Adaptive questionnaires for facilitating patient data entry in clinical decision support systems: Methods and application to STOPP/START v2" by Jean-Baptiste Lamy et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the application of an adaptive questionnaire to the STOPP/START v2 guideline, which suggests that the dataset used may be related to this guideline.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **methods section**. The authors describe the implementation of the adaptive questionnaire in the context of the STOPP/START v2 guideline, which includes 114 recommendations for managing polypharmacy. This indicates that the dataset likely consists of clinical conditions and recommendations from this guideline.

In the **results section**, the authors provide details about the clinical conditions used in their study. They mention that 73 distinct clinical conditions were required for the STOPP/START v2 implementation, which confirms the existence of a dataset related to these conditions.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for the STOPP/START v2 guideline, as it is the primary dataset referenced in this paper. The relevant citation is:

- For the STOPP/START v2 guideline:
  > O’Mahony, D., O’Sullivan, D., Byrne, S., O’Connor, M. N., Ryan, C., & Gallagher, P. (2015). STOPP/START criteria for potentially inappropriate prescribing in older people: version 2. *Age and Ageing*, 44(2), 213-218. doi:10.1093/ageing/afu145.

Additionally, the authors mention the ABiMed project, which aims to design a clinical decision support system for managing polypharmacy. While this project may not constitute a dataset in itself, it is relevant to the context of the research.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research.
