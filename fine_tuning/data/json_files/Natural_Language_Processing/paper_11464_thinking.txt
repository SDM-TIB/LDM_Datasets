To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Does mBERT Understand Romansh? Evaluating Word Embeddings Using Word Alignment" by Eyal Liron Dolev, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions a new trilingual corpus called the **DERMIT (DE-RM-IT) corpus**, which is a significant dataset for the study. This indicates that there is at least one dataset to extract.

Next, I will look for detailed descriptions of the dataset in the **corpus section**. Here, the author describes the DERMIT corpus as containing **4,547 parallel documents** and approximately **100,000 sentence pairs** in each language combination (German, Romansh, and Italian). This section provides essential details about the dataset's structure and content.

Additionally, I will check the **gold standard for word alignment** section, where the author mentions creating a gold standard consisting of **600 German-Romansh sentence pairs** annotated for word alignment. This is another dataset that needs to be documented.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the **references section** of the paper. The DERMIT corpus is a new dataset introduced by the author, so I will cite it as follows:

- **DERMIT Corpus**:
  > Eyal Liron Dolev. *Does mBERT Understand Romansh? Evaluating Word Embeddings Using Word Alignment*. Master’s thesis, University of Zurich, 2022. Available at: https://github.com/eyldlv/DERMIT-Corpus.

For the gold standard for word alignment, since it is part of the same work, I will reference it similarly:

- **Gold Standard for Word Alignment**:
  > Eyal Liron Dolev. *Does mBERT Understand Romansh? Evaluating Word Embeddings Using Word Alignment*. Master’s thesis, University of Zurich, 2022.

After collecting this information, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **DERMIT Corpus**: A trilingual corpus containing press releases in German, Romansh, and Italian, with 4,547 parallel documents and approximately 100,000 sentence pairs in each language combination.

2. **Gold Standard for Word Alignment**: A dataset consisting of 600 annotated German-Romansh sentence pairs for evaluating word alignment.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
