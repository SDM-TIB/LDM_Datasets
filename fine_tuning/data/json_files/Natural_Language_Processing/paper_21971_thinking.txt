To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Masked Two-channel Decoupling Framework for Incomplete Multi-view Weak Multi-label Learning" by Chengliang Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, but I will need to look deeper into the paper for specific dataset names.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the context of their research and mention the need for datasets in multi-view learning. However, they do not specify any datasets here, so I will move on to the **experiments section**.

In **section 3.1 (Datasets and metrics)**, the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. They mention five datasets:

1. **Corel5k**: A dataset with 4,999 samples and 260 categories, featuring six different views.
2. **Pascal07**: Contains 9,963 samples and 20 categories, also with six views.
3. **ESPGame**: Comprises 20,770 samples and 268 categories, with six views.
4. **IAPRTC12**: This dataset has 19,627 samples and 291 categories, featuring six views.
5. **MIRFLICKR**: Contains 25,000 samples and 38 categories, with six views.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The paper provides citations for the datasets as follows:

- For **Corel5k**, the citation is:
  > Pinar Duygulu, Kobus Barnard, Joao FG de Freitas, and David A Forsyth. *Object recognition as machine translation: Learning a lexicon for a fixed image vocabulary*. In European Conference on Computer Vision, pages 97–112, 2002.

- For **Pascal07**, the citation is:
  > Mark Everingham, Luc Van Gool, Christopher KI Williams, John Winn, and Andrew Zisserman. *The pascal visual object classes (voc) challenge*. International journal of computer vision, 88:303–308, 2009.

- For **ESPGame**, the citation is:
  > Luis Von Ahn and Laura Dabbish. *Labeling images with a computer game*. In SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, pages 319–326, 2004.

- For **IAPRTC12**, the citation is:
  > M Henning, D Thomas, et al. *The iapr benchmark: A new evaluation resource for visual information systems*. In International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation, pages 1–11, 2006.

- For **MIRFLICKR**, the citation is:
  > Mark J Huiskes and Michael S Lew. *The mir flickr retrieval evaluation*. In ACM International Conference on Multimedia Information Retrieval, pages 39–43, 2008.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use.

In summary, I have successfully extracted the datasets from the paper, ensuring to include their full citations, which is crucial for proper referencing in any subsequent work.
