To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Reasoning over Hierarchical Question Decomposition Tree for Explainable Question Answering" by Jiajie Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. In the abstract, the authors refer to experiments conducted on **two complex QA datasets: KQA Pro and Musique**. This indicates that these datasets are significant to the research.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section 5) where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used. Here, they mention:

1. **KQA Pro**: This dataset is described as a large-scale complex QA dataset that includes 120,000 diverse natural language questions, structured over a knowledge base (KB). The authors also note that it includes a subset of Wikidata and provides a KoPL program for each question.

2. **Musique**: This dataset is characterized as a multi-hop QA dataset over text, containing 25,000 questions that are constructed from single-hop QA datasets. The authors highlight that it includes annotated evidence paragraphs and distractor paragraphs, making it a challenging dataset for QA tasks.

After identifying these datasets, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For **KQA Pro**, the citation is:
> Shulin Cao, Jiaxin Shi, Liangming Pan, Lunyiu Nie, Yutong Xiang, Lei Hou, Juanzi Li, Bin He, and Hanwang Zhang. *KQA pro: A dataset with explicit compositional programs for complex question answering over knowledge base*. In Proceedings of the 60th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers), ACL 2022, Dublin, Ireland, May 22-27, 2022, pages 6101–6119. Association for Computational Linguistics.

For **Musique**, the citation is:
> Harsh Trivedi, Niranjan Balasubramanian, Tushar Khot, and Ashish Sabharwal. *Musique: Multi-hop questions via single-hop question composition*. Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics, 10:539–554, 2022.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This includes ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation for proper referencing.
