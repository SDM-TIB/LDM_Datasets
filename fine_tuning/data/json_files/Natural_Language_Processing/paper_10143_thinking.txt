To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Generalized Generalized Linear Models: Convex Estimation and Online Bounds" by Anatoli Juditsky et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the application of the proposed methods to a real data example for wildfires, which suggests that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **introduction**. The authors mention that they demonstrate the performance of their algorithm using numerical simulations and a real data example for wildfire incidents. This indicates that there is a dataset related to wildfires that I need to identify.

In the **real data illustrations section (Section 6)**, the authors provide detailed information about the dataset used. They describe the wildfires dataset, which contains occurrences of wildfires in California from June 2014 to December 2019. The dataset is retrieved from the California Public Utilities Commission and is discretized into 26 disjoint rectangle cells, with fire incidents grouped by months.

I will now extract the relevant details about the dataset:

1. **Wildfire Dataset**: This dataset contains wildfire occurrences in California from June 2014 to December 2019. It includes data on the number of wildfire incidents at various locations, which are grouped by months. The dataset is used to demonstrate the application of the proposed GGLM methods.

Next, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The authors mention that the dataset is retrieved from the California Public Utilities Commission, but they do not provide a formal citation in the references. Therefore, I will note the source as follows:

- **California Public Utilities Commission**. Wildfire dataset. Retrieved from: https://www.cpuc.ca.gov/wildfires/

Now that I have identified the dataset and its source, I will compile the information into a structured format for further use.

In summary, I have extracted the following dataset information:
- **Dataset Name**: Wildfire Dataset
- **Description**: Contains occurrences of wildfires in California from June 2014 to December 2019, grouped by months and discretized into 26 rectangle cells.
- **Citation**: California Public Utilities Commission. Wildfire dataset. Retrieved from: https://www.cpuc.ca.gov/wildfires/

This structured information will be useful for any further processing or documentation needs.
