To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Boosting legal case retrieval by query content selection with large language models" by Youchao Zhou et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. In the abstract, the authors discuss the use of large language models (LLMs) for query content selection, which suggests that they may have utilized specific datasets for their experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors mention benchmarks such as **LeCaRD** and **COLIEE**. This indicates that these datasets are relevant to their research. I will look for more details about these datasets in the subsequent sections.

In **section 3.1 (Dataset)**, the authors provide a detailed description of the **LeCaRD dataset**, which is a well-annotated Chinese legal case retrieval benchmark. They mention that it consists of 107 queries and 10,700 candidate cases selected from a corpus of over 43,000 Chinese criminal judgments. This section confirms that LeCaRD is a primary dataset used in their research.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the LeCaRD dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:
> Yixiao Ma, Yunqiu Shao, Yueyue Wu, Yiqun Liu, Ruizhe Zhang, Min Zhang, and Shaoping Ma. *LeCaRD: a legal case retrieval dataset for Chinese law system*. In Proceedings of the 44th international ACM SIGIR conference on research and development in information retrieval, pages 2342–2348, 2021.

Additionally, the authors mention **COLIEE** in the introduction as another benchmark. I will look for its details in the references as well. The citation for COLIEE is:
> Yoshinobu Kano, Mi-Young Kim, Masaharu Yoshioka, Yao Lu, Juliano Rabelo, Naoki Kiyota, Randy Goebel, and Ken Satoh. *COLIEE-2018: Evaluation of the Competition on Legal Information Extraction and Entailment*. In JSAI-isAI Workshops, 2018.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will summarize the findings:

1. **LeCaRD Dataset**: A well-annotated Chinese legal case retrieval benchmark consisting of 107 queries and 10,700 candidate cases.
   - Citation: Yixiao Ma, Yunqiu Shao, Yueyue Wu, Yiqun Liu, Ruizhe Zhang, Min Zhang, and Shaoping Ma. *LeCaRD: a legal case retrieval dataset for Chinese law system*. In Proceedings of the 44th international ACM SIGIR conference on research and development in information retrieval, pages 2342–2348, 2021.

2. **COLIEE Dataset**: A benchmark for evaluating legal information extraction and entailment.
   - Citation: Yoshinobu Kano, Mi-Young Kim, Masaharu Yoshioka, Yao Lu, Juliano Rabelo, Naoki Kiyota, Randy Goebel, and Ken Satoh. *COLIEE-2018: Evaluation of the Competition on Legal Information Extraction and Entailment*. In JSAI-isAI Workshops, 2018.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
