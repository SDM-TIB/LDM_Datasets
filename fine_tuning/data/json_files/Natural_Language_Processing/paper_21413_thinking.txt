To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Lyapunov-stable Neural Control for State and Output Feedback" by Lujie Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and it may mention specific datasets used for validation or experiments. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets, while the methodology and experiments sections typically detail the datasets used in the study.

In the **introduction**, I will look for any references to datasets that are crucial for the experiments or validation of the proposed methods. If the authors mention specific datasets or benchmarks, I will note them down.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**. This section usually contains detailed descriptions of the datasets used, including their characteristics, sizes, and any specific configurations relevant to the experiments. I will look for any subsections that explicitly mention datasets, such as "Datasets" or "Experimental Setup."

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **Inverted Pendulum Dataset**: This dataset is used for training and validating the neural control policies. It involves simulating the dynamics of an inverted pendulum system under various conditions.

2. **Quadrotor Dataset**: This dataset is utilized for the 2D quadrotor control experiments. It includes data from simulations where the quadrotor is controlled to maintain a specific height using neural network-based controllers.

Now, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for these datasets. It is crucial to provide accurate citations for each dataset mentioned.

- For the **Inverted Pendulum Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Tedrake, R., Manchester, I. R., Tobenkin, M., & Roberts, J. W. (2010). *LQR-Trees: Feedback Motion Planning via Sums-of-Squares Verification*. The International Journal of Robotics Research.

- For the **Quadrotor Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Zhang, T., Kahn, G., Levine, S., & Abbeel, P. (2016). *Learning Deep Control Policies for Autonomous Aerial Vehicles with MPC-Guided Policy Search*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA).

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described clearly along with its full citation. This structured approach will help in accurately documenting the datasets used in the research paper.
