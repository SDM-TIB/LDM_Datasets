To extract datasets from the research paper titled "How Good is Zero-Shot MT Evaluation for Low Resource Indian Languages?" by Anushka Singh et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors collected annotations for low-resource Indian languages, which suggests that there are datasets involved.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **methodology** section, particularly in subsections that discuss data collection and annotation. The authors mention collecting **MQM annotations** and **Direct Assessment (DA) scores** for four languages: Assamese, Kannada, Maithili, and Punjabi. This indicates that there is a dataset created for these languages.

In **section 3.1 (MQM Data Annotation)**, the authors detail the process of collecting human scores for translations in these languages, confirming that they have created a dataset consisting of 250 annotations per language, totaling 1000 MQM annotations. This is a significant dataset that I need to document.

Additionally, in **section 3.2 (Synthetic Data Creation)**, the authors mention generating synthetic data for the same four languages, which adds another layer to the datasets involved. They specify the sizes of the synthetic datasets created: approximately 44k sentences for Assamese, 32k for Kannada, 24k for Maithili, and 6k for Punjabi.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The authors reference the MQM approach and other related works, but they do not provide specific citations for the datasets they created. However, I can cite the paper itself as the source of the dataset.

The citations for the datasets I will include are:

1. **MQM Dataset for Low Resource Indian Languages**:

With this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the names of the datasets, their descriptions, and the full citations as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research.
