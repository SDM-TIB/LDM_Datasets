To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Nonparametric Latent Causal Graphs with Unknown Interventions" by Yibo Jiang and Bryon Aragam, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for evaluation or experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors often discuss the context of their research and may reference specific datasets that are foundational to their work. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or benchmarks.

Then, I will examine the **methodology** and **experiments sections** in detail. These sections typically contain descriptions of the datasets used for training and testing the models. I will look for specific names of datasets, their characteristics, and any relevant details such as the number of samples, types of data, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. I will ensure that I capture the authors, title, publication venue, and year for each dataset.

For example, if the authors mention using a dataset like the "Penn Action Dataset," I will look for its citation in the references. The citation format typically includes the authors' names, the title of the paper, the conference or journal name, and the year of publication.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, into a structured format for clarity and ease of use.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets referenced in the paper, providing a comprehensive overview that includes all necessary citations.
