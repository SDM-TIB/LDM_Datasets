To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Applications of Large Scale Foundation Models for Autonomous Diving" by Yu Huang, Yue Chen, and Zhu Li, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections that discuss experiments or methodologies** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract may provide a brief overview of the datasets used, while the introduction often contextualizes their importance.

Next, I will focus on sections that explicitly mention datasets, such as **methodology or experiments**. I will look for any specific names of datasets, descriptions of their contents, and how they were utilized in the research. For instance, if the authors mention using datasets for training or evaluation, I will note those details.

As I identify datasets, I will also check the **References section** of the paper to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets themselves.

For example, if the authors mention a dataset like "nuScenes," I will look for its citation in the references, which might look something like this:
> "NuScenes: A Large-Scale Dataset for Autonomous Driving" by Caesar et al., 2020.

I will repeat this process for each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring I capture the name, a brief description, and the full citation.

Once I have gathered all the datasets and their citations, I will compile them into a structured format for easy reference. This will include the dataset name, a brief description of its contents and purpose, and the full citation as found in the references.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document all relevant datasets from the research paper, providing a comprehensive overview that can be useful for future research or applications in the field of autonomous driving.
