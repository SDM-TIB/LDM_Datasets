To extract datasets from the research paper titled "AURORA-M: The First Open Source Multilingual Language Model Red-teamed according to the U.S. Executive Order" by Taishi Nakamura et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the model and its training, while the introduction may highlight the significance of the datasets used.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used for training AURORA-M. Here, I will look for specific names of datasets, their purposes, and any relevant details about their composition or characteristics.

In this section, the authors mention several datasets used in the Continual Auxiliary Pretraining (CAP) and Continual Alignment Tuning (CAT) stages. I will list these datasets, ensuring to note their descriptions and any relevant statistics provided.

1. **General Multilingual Web Data**: This includes datasets like:
   - **Stack**: Kocetkov et al., 2022.
   - **RefinedWeb**: Penedo et al., 2023.
   - **RedPajama**: Together, 2023.
   - **The Pile**: Gao et al., 2020.
   - **Wikipedia**: Various languages.

2. **Instruction Tuning Datasets**: This includes:
   - **OpenAssistant**: KÃ¶pf et al., 2023.
   - **APIBench**: Patil et al., 2023.
   - **Biden-Harris Redteam Dataset**: This is a new dataset created specifically for safety evaluations, which I will detail further.

Next, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for ensuring that I have the correct and complete references for each dataset.

For example, the citation for the **Biden-Harris Redteam Dataset** is derived from the methodology described in the paper, which outlines its creation and purpose in relation to the Executive Order on AI.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the datasets into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset entry includes:
- The name of the dataset.
- A brief description of its purpose and characteristics.
- The full citation for the dataset as referenced in the paper.

Finally, I will ensure that all entries are clear and concise, ready for any further processing or review. This systematic approach will help me accurately extract and document the datasets from the research paper.
