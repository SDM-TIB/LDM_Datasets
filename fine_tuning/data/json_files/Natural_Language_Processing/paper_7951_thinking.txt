To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Recitation-Augmented Language Models" by Zhiqing Sun et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors verify the effectiveness of their method on three closed-book question answering tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4), where the authors describe the datasets used for evaluation. In **section 4.1.1 (Evaluation Datasets)**, they explicitly list the datasets:

1. **Natural Questions**: This dataset consists of questions aggregated from the Google search engine, with answers sourced from the top 5 search results on Wikipedia. It is treated as a single-hop question answering task.

2. **TriviaQA**: This dataset is constructed from trivia enthusiast-authored question-answer pairs and their retrospectively collected evidence. It is evaluated in a single-hop setting.

3. **HotpotQA**: This dataset is designed for multi-hop reasoning and is collected by composing questions that require reasoning over multiple supporting documents.

I will then verify the details of each dataset mentioned in the paper to ensure accuracy. The authors provide specific references for each dataset, which I will need to include in my citations.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to retrieve the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Natural Questions**, the citation is:
  > Kwiatkowski, T., Palomaki, J., Redfield, O., Collins, M., Parikh, A., Alberti, C., Epstein, D., Polosukhin, I., Lee, K., et al. (2019). *Natural Questions: A Benchmark for Question Answering Research*. Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics, 7, 453-466.

- For **TriviaQA**, the citation is:
  > Joshi, M., Choi, E., Weld, D. S., & Zettlemoyer, L. (2017). *TriviaQA: A Large Scale Distantly Supervised Challenge Dataset for Reading Comprehension*. In Proceedings of the 55th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers), pp. 1601-1611.

- For **HotpotQA**, the citation is:
  > Yang, Z., Dai, Z., Yang, Y., Carbonell, J., Salakhutdinov, R. R., & Le, Q. V. (2018). *HotpotQA: A Dataset for Diverse, Explainable Multi-Hop Question Answering*. In Proceedings of the 2018 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pp. 2369-2380.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I accurately capture all relevant datasets and their citations from the paper.
