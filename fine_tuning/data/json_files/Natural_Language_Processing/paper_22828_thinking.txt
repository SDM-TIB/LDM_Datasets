To extract datasets from the research paper titled "RET-CLIP: A Retinal Image Foundation Model Pre-trained with Clinical Diagnostic Reports" by Jiawei Du et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions a dataset of **193,865 patients** used for training the RET-CLIP model, which indicates that this dataset is significant. The introduction further emphasizes the importance of clinical diagnostic reports and the integration of image-text pairs, suggesting that there may be multiple datasets involved.

Next, I will focus on the **Method** section, particularly **section 2.1 (Data Collection and Preprocessing)**, where the authors describe the dataset they constructed, referred to as **RET-Clinical**. This dataset consists of **binocular images-text triplets** for each patient, which includes two color fundus photographs (CFPs) for the left and right eyes, along with a clinical diagnostic report. This is a key dataset that I need to document.

Then, I will examine **section 3.1 (Tasks and Datasets)**, where the authors list several datasets used for evaluation across different diagnostic tasks. The datasets mentioned include:

1. **IDRID**: Contains 516 images for diabetic retinopathy diagnosis.
2. **APTOS-2019**: Contains 3,662 images for diabetic retinopathy diagnosis.
3. **PAPILA**: A dataset with 488 images for glaucoma diagnosis.
4. **Glaucoma Fundus**: Contains 1,544 images for glaucoma diagnosis.
5. **JSIEC**: A dataset with 1,000 images for multiple disease diagnosis.
6. **Retina**: Contains 601 images for multiple disease diagnosis.
7. **RFMid**: A dataset with 3,200 images for multi-label classification of multiple diseases.
8. **ODIR**: Contains 10,000 images for multi-label classification of multiple diseases.

I will also check the **References section** to gather full citations for each dataset mentioned. Here are the citations I will extract:

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, which is essential for reproducibility and further research.
