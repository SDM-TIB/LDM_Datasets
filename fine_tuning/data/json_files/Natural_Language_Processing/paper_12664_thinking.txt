To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Novel Cross-Perturbation for Single Domain Generalization" by Dongjia Zhao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions "extensive experiments on various benchmark datasets," which indicates that datasets are likely discussed in detail later in the paper. The introduction also emphasizes the importance of data diversity in training, suggesting that specific datasets may be referenced.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors specifically mention using **CIFAR-10**, **CIFAR-100**, and **PACS** as benchmark datasets for their experiments. I will note the context in which these datasets are used, such as for evaluating the performance of their proposed method, CPerb.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide details about the datasets:
1. **CIFAR-10**: A widely used dataset consisting of 50,000 training images and 10,000 testing images across 10 object categories.
2. **CIFAR-100**: Similar to CIFAR-10 but with 100 classes, containing 50,000 training images and 10,000 testing images.
3. **PACS**: A dataset used for domain generalization tasks, comprising images from four domains: art painting, cartoon, photo, and sketch, totaling 9,991 images.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **CIFAR-10** and **CIFAR-100**:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton. "Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images." 2009.

- For **PACS**:
  > Dongxu Li, Yujun Shen, Y.-Z. Song, and T. M. Hospedales. "Deeper, Broader and Artier Domain Generalization." In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2017, pp. 5542â€“5550.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations as required. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant details about the datasets used in the research paper.
