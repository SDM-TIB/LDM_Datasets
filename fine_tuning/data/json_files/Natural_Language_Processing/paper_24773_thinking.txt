To extract datasets from the research paper titled "When Search Engine Services meet Large Language Models: Visions and Challenges" by Haoyi Xiong et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a high-level overview, and I will look for any specific datasets that may be highlighted as part of the research.

Next, I will focus on the **main body of the paper**, particularly sections that discuss experiments, methodologies, or data collection. I will look for any mentions of datasets used for training, evaluation, or analysis. For instance, if the authors discuss using datasets for pre-training Large Language Models (LLMs) or for evaluating search engine performance, I will note these down.

In the **background or related work sections**, the authors may reference existing datasets that are relevant to their research. I will pay attention to any citations or descriptions that indicate the datasets' names, sizes, and purposes.

Once I identify the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets themselves.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like "Common Crawl" or "Wikipedia," I will look for the original papers or documentation that describe these datasets in detail. I will ensure to include the authors, title, publication venue, and year for each dataset.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will help in accurately documenting the datasets used in the research.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset information in a clear and organized manner, ready for presentation or further processing.
