To extract datasets from the research paper titled "WMFormer++: Nested Transformer for Visible Watermark Removal via Implicit Joint Learning" by Dongjian Huo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that extensive experiments were conducted on various challenging benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved. The introduction further emphasizes the importance of watermark removal and mentions specific datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments in the **experiment** section. They mention:

1. **LOGO-L Dataset**: This dataset contains 12,151 training images and 2,025 testing images with varying watermarks.
2. **LOGO-H Dataset**: Similar to LOGO-L but with larger watermark sizes and transparency.
3. **LOGO-Gray Dataset**: Contains grayscale watermarks.
4. **CLWD Dataset**: Comprises 60,000 watermarked images with 160 colored watermarks for training and 10,000 images with 40 colored watermarks for testing.

I will then confirm the details of these datasets by cross-referencing them with the **results** and **discussion** sections to ensure that they are indeed the datasets used for the experiments.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **references section** to gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **LOGO-L Dataset**:
  > Cun, X.; and Pun, C.-M. 2021. Split then refine: stacked attention-guided ResUNets for blind single image visible watermark removal. In Proceedings of the AAAI conference on artificial intelligence, volume 35, 1184–1192.

- For **LOGO-H Dataset**:

- For **LOGO-Gray Dataset**:

  > Liu, Y.; Zhu, Z.; and Bai, X. 2021. Wdnet: Watermark-decomposition network for visible watermark removal. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision, 3685–3693.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including their descriptions and citations, into a structured format for easy reference and further processing.
