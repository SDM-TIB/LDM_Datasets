To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Collective Perception Datasets for Autonomous Driving: A Comprehensive Review" by Sven Teufel et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets along with their full citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the paper reviews various V2V and V2X datasets, which suggests that multiple datasets will be discussed throughout the paper.

Next, I will focus on **Section II (Dataset Review)**, which is likely to contain detailed descriptions of the datasets. This section is divided into two parts: **II-A (Simulated Datasets)** and **II-B (Real-World Datasets)**. I will carefully extract information from both parts to identify the datasets, their characteristics, and their intended tasks.

In **II-A**, I will look for datasets such as:
1. **V2V-Sim**: Released in 2020 by Wang et al. This dataset is generated using LiDARsim and contains 5,500 snippets for collective 3D object detection.
2. **CODD**: Introduced by Arnold et al. in 2021, this dataset consists of LiDAR point clouds for collective perception and SLAM, with 13,500 frames.
3. **COMAP**: Presented by Yuan et al. in 2021, this dataset includes 21 intersection scenarios and is used for collective 3D object detection and semantic segmentation.
4. **V2XSet**: Released by Xu et al. in 2022, this dataset contains 11,447 frames for collective 3D object detection.
5. **DOLPHINS**: Introduced by Mao et al. in 2022, this dataset consists of 42,376 frames for collective 3D object detection.
6. **OPV2V**: Released by Runsheng et al. in 2022, this dataset includes 11,464 frames for collective 3D object detection.
7. **V2X-Sim**: Version 1.0 was released in 2021 by Li et al., and Version 2.0 in 2022, both focusing on collective 3D object detection.

In **II-B**, I will extract information about real-world datasets such as:
1. **T&J**: Released by Chen et al. in 2019, this dataset consists of 100 frames for collective 3D object detection but lacks labels.
2. **DAIR-V2X**: Presented by Yu et al. in 2022, this dataset includes data from multiple infrastructure sensors and is suitable for collective 3D object detection.
3. **V2X-Seq**: Published in 2023 by Yu et al., this dataset focuses on collective object tracking and trajectory forecasting.
4. **V2V4Real**: Released in 2023 by Xu et al., this dataset contains 10,000 frames for collective 3D object detection.
5. **LUCOOP**: Published by Axmann et al. in 2023, this dataset consists of 15,000 frames for urban navigation and 3D object detection.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to gather the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets.

For example, the full citation for **V2V-Sim** will be:
> Wang, T.-H., Manivasagam, S., Liang, M., Yang, B., Zeng, W., & Urtasun, R. (2020). V2VNet: Vehicle-to-Vehicle Communication for Joint Perception and Prediction. In Computer Visionâ€“ECCV 2020: 16th European Conference, Glasgow, UK, Proceedings, Part II 16. Springer.

I will repeat this process for each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring that I capture all relevant details and citations.

Finally, I will compile the extracted dataset information into a structured format for easy reference and further analysis.
