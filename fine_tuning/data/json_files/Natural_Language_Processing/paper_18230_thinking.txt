To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Disentangled Condensation for Large-scale Graphs" by Zhenbang Xiao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions and may mention specific datasets used for experiments. 

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly **Table II**, which summarizes the statistics of the datasets used in the experiments. This table lists several datasets along with their characteristics, such as the number of nodes, edges, and classes. The datasets mentioned in this table are crucial for my extraction process.

The datasets identified in **Table II** include:

1. **Cora**: A well-known dataset for node classification tasks, consisting of 2,708 nodes and 5,429 edges.
2. **ogbn-arxiv**: A dataset from the Open Graph Benchmark, used for transductive node classification, containing 169,343 nodes and 1,166,243 edges.
3. **ogbn-products**: Another dataset from the Open Graph Benchmark, also for transductive node classification, with 2,449,029 nodes and 61,859,140 edges.
4. **reddit**: An inductive node classification dataset with 232,965 nodes and 114,615,892 edges.
5. **reddit2**: Another inductive dataset similar to reddit, with the same number of nodes and edges.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are essential for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

- **Cora**: 
  > M. McCallum, K. Nigam, "A Comparison of Event Models for Naive Bayes Text Classification," in *Proceedings of the AAAI-98 Workshop on Learning for Text Categorization*, 1998.

- **ogbn-arxiv**: 
  > Weihua Hu et al., "Open Graph Benchmark: Datasets for Machine Learning on Graphs," in *Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems*, 2020.

- **ogbn-products**: 
  > Weihua Hu et al., "Open Graph Benchmark: Datasets for Machine Learning on Graphs," in *Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems*, 2020.

- **reddit**: 
  > J. Zhang et al., "Graph Neural Networks for Social Recommendation," in *International World Wide Web Conference*, 2019.

- **reddit2**: 
  > J. Zhang et al., "Graph Neural Networks for Social Recommendation," in *International World Wide Web Conference*, 2019.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or processing. This structured approach ensures that I have accurately captured all relevant details about the datasets used in the research paper.
