To extract datasets from the research paper titled "PREFER: Prompt Ensemble Learning via Feedback-Reflect-Refine" by Chenrui Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the performance of the proposed method across various tasks, which may imply the use of datasets, but I need to look for specific names.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section**, which is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, the authors list several datasets used for their experiments, specifically for tasks like natural language inference and classification.

The datasets mentioned in the experiments section include:

1. **SNLI (Stanford Natural Language Inference)**: A dataset for textual entailment inference.
2. **MNLI (Multi-Genre Natural Language Inference)**: Another dataset for textual entailment inference.
3. **RTE (Recognizing Textual Entailment)**: A dataset for textual entailment tasks.
4. **QNLI (Question Natural Language Inference)**: A dataset for question-answering inference.
5. **Ethos**: A dataset for hate speech detection.
6. **Liar**: A dataset for fake news classification.
7. **ArSarcasm**: A dataset for Arabic sarcasm detection.

After identifying these datasets, I will look into the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. 

The citations I will extract are:

- For **SNLI**:
  > Bowman, S. R.; Angeli, G.; Potts, C.; and Manning, C. D. (2015). A large annotated corpus for learning natural language inference. *arXiv preprint arXiv:1508.05326*.

- For **MNLI**:
  > Williams, A.; Nangia, N.; and Bowman, S. R. (2017). A broad-coverage challenge corpus for sentence understanding through inference. *arXiv preprint arXiv:1704.05426*.

- For **Ethos**:
  > Mollas, I.; Chrysopoulou, Z.; Karlos, S.; and Tsoumakas, G. (2020). Ethos: An online hate speech detection dataset. *arXiv preprint arXiv:2006.08328*.

- For **Liar**:
  > Wang, W. Y. (2017). "Liar, liar pants on fire": A new benchmark dataset for fake news detection. *arXiv preprint arXiv:1705.00648*.

  > Farha, I. A.; and Magdy, W. (2020). From Arabic sentiment analysis to sarcasm detection: The ArSarcasm dataset. In *Proceedings of the 4th Workshop on Open-Source Arabic Corpora and Processing Tools*, 32–39.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
