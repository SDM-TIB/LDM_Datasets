To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards real-time 6D pose estimation of objects in single-view cone-beam X-ray" by Christiaan G.A. Viviers et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used. The introduction often discusses the context and significance of the datasets, which can help identify them.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of obtaining large medical image datasets due to privacy restrictions. This indicates that they may have created or utilized specific datasets for their experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly **section 3.1**, where the authors describe the "marked cube X-ray dataset." Here, they provide details about the dataset, including the number of images, their resolution, and the division of data into training and validation sets. This section is crucial as it explicitly outlines the dataset used for their experiments.

The authors mention that the marked cube dataset consists of **2,042 manually annotated 8-bit 960Ã—960-pixel grayscale images**, which are divided into an 80/20 train/validation split. This is a clear indication of the dataset's structure and purpose.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the dataset mentioned. Since the marked cube dataset is a custom dataset created for this study, it may not have a formal citation like publicly available datasets. However, I will note that it is referenced in the context of the paper itself.

For the **marked cube dataset**, I will summarize the information as follows:
- **Dataset Name**: Marked Cube X-ray Dataset
- **Description**: A dataset consisting of 2,042 manually annotated 8-bit grayscale images of a marked cube, used for evaluating 6D pose estimation models in X-ray images.
- **Citation**: Viviers, C.G.A., de Bruijn, J., Filatova, L., de With, P.H.N., & van der Sommen, F. (2023). Towards real-time 6D pose estimation of objects in single-view cone-beam X-ray. [Journal/Conference Name, if available].

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the dataset details and provided the necessary citations for future reference.
