To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Bayesian uncertainty-weighted loss for improved generalisability on polyp segmentation task" by Rebecca S. Stone et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract highlights the use of a multi-center polyp segmentation dataset called **PolypGen**, which is a strong indication that this dataset is central to the research.

Next, I will examine **section 4.1 (Dataset and experimental setup)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the **PolypGen dataset**. They describe it as an expert-curated dataset comprising both single frames and sequence frames from over 300 unique patients across six different medical centers. This section will provide specifics about the dataset's composition, including the number of frames and the challenges associated with the data.

In this section, the authors also mention three test datasets used for generalisability assessment:
1. **C6-SIN**: 88 single frames from an unseen center.
2. **C6-SEQ**: 432 frames from sequence data from the same unseen center.
3. **C1-5-SEQ**: 124 frames from seen centers, which include both positive and negative samples.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the **PolypGen dataset**. The relevant citation is:
> Ali, S., Jha, D., Ghatwary, N., Realdon, S., Cannizzaro, R., Salem, O.E., Lamarque, D., Daul, C., Riegler, M.A., Anonsen, K.V., et al. *A multi-centre polyp detection and segmentation dataset for generalisability assessment*. Scientific Data 10(1), 75 (2023).

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the **PolypGen dataset** and the details of the three test datasets mentioned.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for review or further processing, ensuring that the citations are correctly formatted and complete.
