To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards High-Quality 3D Motion Transfer with Realistic Apparel Animation" by Rong Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the creation of a new dataset called **MMDMC**, which is a strong indicator that this dataset is central to the research.

Next, I will look for detailed descriptions of the **MMDMC dataset** in the **Methods section**. The authors describe how this dataset combines stylized characters from the MikuMikuDance community with real-world motion capture data. They emphasize that the dataset includes detailed apparel annotations, which are crucial for their research.

In the **Experiments section**, the authors confirm that they evaluate their method using the **MMDMC dataset** and also mention using the **Mixamo dataset** for qualitative comparisons. This indicates that both datasets are relevant to their experiments.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

1. **MMDMC Dataset**: The authors created this dataset specifically for their research, and they provide a link to it in the paper. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Wang, R., Mao, W., Lu, C., & Li, H. (2024). *Towards High-Quality 3D Motion Transfer with Realistic Apparel Animation*. Available at: https://github.com/rongakowang/MMDMC.

2. **Mixamo Dataset**: The Mixamo dataset is referenced as a publicly available resource. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Mixamo. (2024). *Mixamo*. Available at: http://www.mixamo.com/.

After identifying these datasets and their citations, I will compile the information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their respective citations.
