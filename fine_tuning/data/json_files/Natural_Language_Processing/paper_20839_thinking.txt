To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SIS epidemics on open networks" by Renato Vizuete, Paolo Frasca, and Elena Panteley, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, but it may not contain specific dataset names. The introduction often discusses the context and relevance of the research, which might include references to datasets used in previous studies.

Next, I will look for a **dedicated section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **results or experiments sections**. If the authors conducted simulations or analyses based on specific datasets, they would likely describe them in detail here.

In this paper, I will pay particular attention to any numerical examples or simulations mentioned, as these often rely on specific datasets. For instance, the authors might refer to datasets used for modeling the SIS epidemic dynamics or for validating their approximations.

After identifying potential datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial, as proper citation is necessary for academic integrity and for readers to locate the original sources.

If the paper does not explicitly mention datasets, I will note that as well, indicating that the authors may have used theoretical models or simulations without relying on external datasets.

Finally, I will compile the identified datasets along with their full citations into a structured format for clarity and ease of reference.

In summary, my steps will be:
1. Read the abstract, introduction, and methodology sections for mentions of datasets.
2. Look for a dedicated datasets section or references in results/experiments.
3. Identify any numerical examples or simulations that may indicate dataset usage.
4. Check the References section for full citations of any datasets mentioned.
5. Compile the findings into a clear summary, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset identified.
