To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "UCCIX: Irish-eXcellence Large Language Model" by Khanh-Tung Tran, Barry Oâ€™Sullivan, and Hoang D. Nguyen, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract highlights the contribution of comprehensive Irish benchmarking datasets, specifically mentioning **IrishQA** and **MT-bench**. This indicates that these datasets are significant to the research.

Next, I will delve into the **introduction** where the authors describe their contributions, including the creation of **IrishQA**, a question-answering dataset, and the Irish version of **MT-bench**. This section provides context about the datasets and their intended use for evaluating Irish LLM systems.

In the **data collection and pre-processing section**, the authors discuss the sources of their data, including **CulturaX**, **Glot500**, and **ParaCrawl**, which are used for training the model. However, these are not the benchmarking datasets but rather the training datasets. I will note these sources for context but focus on the benchmarking datasets.

In the **evaluation data section**, the authors provide details about **IrishQA**, which consists of 60 question-answer pairs, and the Irish version of **MT-bench**, which has been translated and verified by native speakers. This confirms their significance in the evaluation of the model.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

1. **IrishQA**: The paper does not provide a specific citation for IrishQA, as it appears to be a dataset created by the authors themselves. Therefore, I will note it as an original dataset created for this research.

2. **MT-bench**: The original MT-bench dataset is referenced in the paper. The citation is:
   > Lianmin Zheng, Wei-Lin Chiang, Ying Sheng, Siyuan Zhuang, Zhanghao Wu, Yonghao Zhuang, Zi Lin, Dacheng Li, Eric Xing, Hao Zhang, Joseph E. Gonzalez, and Ion Stoica. *Judging LLM-as-a-judge with MT-bench and chatbot arena*. In Thirty-seventh Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems Datasets and Benchmarks Track, (2023).

Now, I will summarize the datasets:

- **IrishQA**: A question-answering dataset created by the authors, consisting of 60 question-answer pairs related to Irish culture and topics.
- **MT-bench**: A dataset adapted to Irish for evaluating instruction-following capabilities in LLMs.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
