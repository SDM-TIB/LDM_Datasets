To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Examining the Presence of Gender Bias in Customer Reviews Using Word Embedding" by Arul Mishra et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** to get an overview of the research context and any datasets that may be referenced. The abstract indicates that the authors utilized data from **millions of observations** from customer reviews, specifically mentioning **11 million reviews from Amazon and Yelp**. This suggests that these two platforms are key datasets for the study.

Next, I will examine the **methodology section** to confirm the datasets used. The authors explicitly state that they analyzed **7.9 million reviews on movie DVDs from Amazon** and **3.4 million Yelp reviews about restaurants**. This provides clear identification of the datasets used in their analysis.

I will also check the **results and discussion sections** to ensure that these datasets are consistently referenced throughout the paper. The authors discuss findings based on the analysis of these datasets, reinforcing their importance to the study.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets. However, since the datasets are derived from Amazon and Yelp, I will note that these platforms do not have traditional citations like academic papers. Instead, I will provide a description of the datasets along with the relevant URLs for Amazon and Yelp:

1. **Amazon Reviews Dataset**: This dataset consists of **7.9 million reviews** on movie DVDs posted on Amazon.com over a 15-year period. The dataset can be accessed through Amazon's product review section.
   - URL: https://www.amazon.com

2. **Yelp Reviews Dataset**: This dataset includes **3.4 million reviews** about restaurants from Yelp. The dataset can be accessed through Yelp's review section.
   - URL: https://www.yelp.com

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and URLs for reference. This will ensure that the datasets are properly documented for future use or analysis.
