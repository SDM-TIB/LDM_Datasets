To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Modeling User Satisfaction Dynamics in Dialogue via Hawkes Process" by Fanghua Ye, Zhiyuan Hu, and Emine Yilmaz, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on "four benchmark dialogue datasets," which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention four datasets:

1. **MultiWOZ 2.1 (MWOZ)**: This dataset is described as a consolidated multi-domain dialogue dataset with state corrections and state tracking baselines. It contains 1000 dialogues.

2. **Schema Guided Dialogue (SGD)**: This dataset is also mentioned as containing 1000 dialogues and is used for evaluating dialogue systems.

3. **JDDC**: This is a Chinese dataset with 3300 dialogues, specifically designed for e-commerce customer service.

4. **Recommendation Dialogues (ReDial)**: This dataset contains 1000 dialogues and is used for evaluating conversational recommendations.

In the same section, the authors note that the satisfaction annotations for these datasets are provided on a five-point scale and are mapped into three-class labels: {dissatisfied, neutral, satisfied}.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
