To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Computational modelling of angiogenesis: The importance of cell rearrangements during vascular growth" by Daria Stepanova et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on angiogenesis and cell rearrangements, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any references to datasets used in the study. The introduction discusses the biological processes of angiogenesis and mentions various theoretical models, but it does not specify any datasets.

I will then look into the **methods section** to see if the authors describe any experimental setups or data collection methods that might involve datasets. This section may provide insights into the types of data collected or analyzed.

After that, I will check the **results section** for any mention of datasets used for analysis or validation of the models. This section often contains specific references to datasets that were utilized in the study.

Finally, I will consult the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned throughout the paper. This is crucial for proper attribution and to ensure that the datasets can be accessed or referenced correctly.

If I find any datasets mentioned, I will ensure to note their names, descriptions, and the full citations as required. If no datasets are explicitly mentioned, I will conclude that the paper may not provide any datasets for extraction.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the full citation for each dataset, as this is very important for proper documentation and future reference.
