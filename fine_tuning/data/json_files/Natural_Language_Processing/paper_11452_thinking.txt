To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Inroads into Autonomous Network Defence using Explained Reinforcement Learning" by Myles Foley et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and while it may not explicitly mention datasets, it sets the context for the study. The introduction often discusses the background and may reference existing datasets used in related work.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology and experiments sections**. These sections typically contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used for training and evaluation. I will look for any specific names of datasets, their characteristics, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

In this paper, the authors mention the **CybORG environment** as a simulation platform for their experiments. I will check if they provide any specific datasets or benchmarks associated with this environment. If they do, I will note the details provided, such as the number of samples, types of data, and any relevant splits (e.g., training/test).

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

For example, if the paper references the **CybORG environment**, I will look for its citation in the references. If the authors mention any specific datasets used within CybORG, I will ensure to find their citations as well.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for easy review and processing, ensuring that all citations are complete and correctly formatted.
