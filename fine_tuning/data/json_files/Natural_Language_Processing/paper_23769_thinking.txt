To extract datasets from the research paper titled "PanoSSC: Exploring Monocular Panoptic 3D Scene Reconstruction for Autonomous Driving" by Yining Shi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of **SemanticKITTI** as a benchmark for evaluating their method, which indicates that this dataset is likely important for their research.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **introduction**. Here, the authors discuss the context of their work and reference various datasets, including **nuScenes**, **KITTI360**, and **Waymo open dataset**. However, I need to confirm which datasets are actually used in their experiments.

In the **experiments section**, particularly in **section 4.1 (Experimental setup)**, the authors explicitly state that they evaluate their method on the **SemanticKITTI** dataset. They provide details about the dataset's focus on semantic scene completion and mention the specific volume and voxel discretization used for their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the **SemanticKITTI** dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:

- **SemanticKITTI**:
  > Jens Behley, Martin Garbade, Andres Milioto, Jan Quenzel, Sven Behnke, Cyrill Stachniss, and Jürgen Gall. *SemanticKITTI: A dataset for semantic scene understanding of lidar sequences*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 9296–9306, 2019.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets being used for their experiments, I will conclude that **SemanticKITTI** is the primary dataset referenced in this research.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, ensuring that I include the full citation for **SemanticKITTI** as it is crucial for proper attribution and further research.

This structured approach allows me to extract the necessary dataset information accurately and efficiently, ensuring that I adhere to the importance of full citations in academic work.
