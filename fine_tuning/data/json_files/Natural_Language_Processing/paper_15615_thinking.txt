To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ProBio: A Protocol-guided Multimodal Dataset for Molecular Biology Lab" by Jieming Cui et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the creation of a dataset called **ProBio**, which is specifically designed for studying activity understanding in molecular biology labs. This indicates that there is a primary dataset to focus on.

Next, I will look into the **Methods** section, particularly the part where the authors describe the dataset in detail. In this section, they provide comprehensive information about **ProBio**, including its structure, the number of videos, and the types of annotations included. The dataset consists of:

1. **ProBio Dataset**: This dataset includes 180.6 hours of multi-view recordings from 13 common biology experiments. It features a hierarchical structure with 3,724 practical experiment instructions and 37,537 human-object interaction annotations.

I will also check the **Experiments** section to see if there are any additional datasets mentioned or used in conjunction with ProBio. However, the focus remains primarily on the ProBio dataset.

Now, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citation for the ProBio dataset. The authors do not provide a separate citation for the dataset itself, as it is part of their own research work. However, I can cite the paper as the source of the dataset:

- For **ProBio Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Jieming Cui, Ziren Gong, Baoxiong Jia, Siyuan Huang, Zilong Zheng, Jianzhu Ma, and Yixin Zhu. *ProBio: A Protocol-guided Multimodal Dataset for Molecular Biology Lab*. In Proceedings of the 37th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2023), 2023.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry for ProBio, ensuring that I include the full citation as required. This will provide a clear and structured representation of the dataset extracted from the paper.
