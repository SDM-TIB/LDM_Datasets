To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning the Plasticity: Plasticity-Driven Learning Framework in Spiking Neural Networks" by Guobin Shen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, results, and methods sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract provides a high-level overview, but I will focus on sections that typically contain detailed information about datasets.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of applying biological plasticity mechanisms in artificial neural networks, but they do not mention specific datasets. I will continue to the **results section**, where the authors describe their experiments.

In **section 2.2 (PDLF Enhances Working Memory Capacity)**, the authors mention using a **copying task** to evaluate the working memory capabilities of their Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs). However, they do not specify a dataset name here.

Next, I will examine **section 2.3 (PDLF Enhances Multi-task Learning)**, where the authors describe their experiments using the **Brax simulator** for various continuous control environments. They mention six specific tasks: **ant_dir, swimmer_dir, halfcheetah_vel, hopper_vel, ur5e, and fetch**. These tasks are part of the experimental setup but do not refer to traditional datasets.

In the **data availability section**, the authors state that codes and data have been deposited on GitHub, which suggests that there may be datasets available for these tasks, but they are not explicitly named in the paper.

Since the paper does not provide formal dataset names or citations, I will note the environments used in the experiments as they are relevant to the research context. However, I will not be able to provide full citations for datasets as they are not explicitly mentioned in the text.

Now, I will summarize the findings regarding the datasets:

1. **Brax Simulator Environments**: The paper describes six environments used for multi-task reinforcement learning:
   - **ant_dir**: Training an ant agent to run in various directions.
   - **swimmer_dir**: Training a swimmer agent to move in a fixed direction.
   - **halfcheetah_vel**: Training a half-cheetah agent to move forward at specific speeds.
   - **hopper_vel**: Training a hopper agent to advance at specific speeds.
   - **ur5e**: A robotic arm task where the agent must reach a target position.
   - **fetch**: A task where a dog agent runs to a target location.

Since the paper does not provide specific citations for these environments, I will note that they are part of the experimental framework but lack formal dataset references.

In conclusion, while I can identify the environments used in the experiments, I cannot provide full citations for datasets as they are not explicitly mentioned in the paper. I will document the environments as part of the research context but will note the absence of formal dataset citations.
