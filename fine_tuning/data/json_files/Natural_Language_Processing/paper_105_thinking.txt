To extract datasets from the research paper titled "New word analogy corpus for exploring embeddings of Czech words" by Lukáš Svoboda and Tomáš Brychcín, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors introduce a new corpus for the word analogy task, which suggests that a dataset is present.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Word analogy corpus)**, where the authors describe the new dataset they created. They mention that the dataset contains 22,257 combinations of questions, which are divided into semantic and syntactic categories. This section provides detailed information about the dataset's structure and content.

The authors specify that the dataset includes:
- **Semantic questions**: Categories such as Presidents-states-cities, Antonyms, and Family-relations.
- **Syntactic questions**: Categories like Adjectives-gradation, Nationalities, Nouns-plural, Jobs, Verb-past, and Pronouns.

I will also check the **References section** to find any citations related to the dataset. However, since the dataset is newly introduced in this paper, it may not have an external citation. Instead, I will note that the dataset is publicly available for research purposes at the provided GitHub link.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring to include the full citation for the paper itself, as it is crucial for proper attribution of the dataset.

The citation for the paper is:
> Svoboda, L., & Brychcín, T. (2023). New word analogy corpus for exploring embeddings of Czech words. In Proceedings of the [Conference Name], [Location], [Date]. [Publisher].

Finally, I will summarize the dataset details, including its purpose, structure, and availability, ensuring that I have captured all relevant information for future reference or processing.
