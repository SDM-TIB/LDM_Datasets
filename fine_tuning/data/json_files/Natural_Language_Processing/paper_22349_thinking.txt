To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Logical Negation Augmenting and Debiasing for Prompt-based Methods" by Yitian Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. In the abstract, the authors state that they conducted experiments on three datasets, which indicates that I should look for their names and details.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors mention the three datasets: **RuleTaker**, **ProofWriter**, and **LogicNLI**. They provide a brief context about these datasets, indicating their relevance to the study of logical reasoning.

Then, I will check the **experiments section** (specifically section 6) to confirm the datasets used in their experiments. The authors explicitly state that they evaluated their method on the three datasets mentioned earlier, which reinforces their importance in the study.

After identifying the datasets, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

1. **RuleTaker**: The citation is:
   > Peter Clark, Oyvind Tafjord, and Kyle Richardson. *Transformers as soft reasoners over language*. In Proceedings of the International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI), 2020.

2. **ProofWriter**: The citation is:
   > Oyvind Tafjord, Bhavana Dalvi, and Peter Clark. *Proofwriter: Generating implications, proofs, and abductive statements over natural language*. In Proceedings of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL), 2021.

3. **LogicNLI**: The citation is:
   > Jidong Tian, Yitian Li, Wenqing Chen, Liqiang Xiao, Hao He, and Yaohui Jin. *Diagnosing the first-order logical reasoning ability through LogicNLI*. In Proceedings of the Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), 2021.

Now that I have the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that highlights each dataset's name, description, and citation, ensuring that the citations are complete and accurate.

This systematic approach ensures that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations from the paper effectively.
