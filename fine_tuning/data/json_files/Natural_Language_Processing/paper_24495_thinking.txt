To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Efficient, Multimodal, and Derivative-Free Bayesian Inference With Fisher-Rao Gradient Flows" by Yifan Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract often provides a concise overview of the research and may mention datasets used for validation or testing. 

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to identify any specific datasets referenced. The authors may discuss the context of their work and mention datasets that are commonly used in the field, which could provide leads on what to look for later.

I will then examine the **methodology and experiments sections** closely. These sections typically contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used, including their names, sizes, and characteristics. I will look for any subsections explicitly labeled as "Datasets" or similar, as these will likely summarize the datasets in use.

If the paper includes a **results section**, I will check for any mentions of datasets in the context of the results obtained. This can provide additional confirmation of the datasets used and their relevance to the findings.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily. I will ensure to note the authors, title, publication venue, and year for each dataset.

For example, if I find that the paper uses the "Penn Action Dataset," I will look for its citation in the references, which might look something like this:
> Wenzheng Zhang, Menglong Zhu, and Konstantinos G. Derpanis. *From Actemes to Action: A Strongly-Supervised Representation for Detailed Action Understanding*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 2248â€“2255, 2013.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that I maintain clarity and accuracy throughout the process.

Finally, I will summarize the findings in a structured format, ready for further processing or review, ensuring that each dataset is clearly identified and properly cited.
