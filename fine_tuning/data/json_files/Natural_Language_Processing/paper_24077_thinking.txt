To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Extrinsic Evaluation of Cultural Competence in Large Language Models" by Shaily Bhatt and Fernando Diaz, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate model outputs for two tasks: open-ended question answering and story generation, which suggests that datasets related to these tasks may be present.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experimental Setup)**, particularly **subsections 4.1 (Tasks and Data)** and **4.2 (Models)**. In subsection 4.1, the authors describe the creation of a list of 345 topics for open-ended question answering and 35 topics for story generation. This indicates that these topics form the basis of the datasets used for evaluation.

In subsection 4.1, the authors detail the prompts used for both tasks, which are crucial for understanding the datasets. The prompts are structured to include nationality as a variable, which is essential for the cultural competence evaluation.

I will also check the **Datasheet section (A)**, where the authors provide additional details about the dataset composition, including the number of instances and the nature of the data. This section confirms that the dataset consists of hand-curated topics and model outputs generated by various LLMs.

Now, I will compile the relevant datasets and their citations:

1. **Open-Ended Question Answering Dataset**: This dataset consists of 345 topics across 13 categories, curated from textbooks and encyclopedias. The topics are designed to evaluate the model's responses based on nationality.
   - Citation: Bhatt, S., & Diaz, F. (2024). *Extrinsic Evaluation of Cultural Competence in Large Language Models*. [Dataset description and details will be available upon publication].

2. **Story Generation Dataset**: This dataset includes 35 topics for children's stories, sourced from online websites and children's storybooks. These topics are used to prompt the LLMs for story generation tasks.
   - Citation: Bhatt, S., & Diaz, F. (2024). *Extrinsic Evaluation of Cultural Competence in Large Language Models*. [Dataset description and details will be available upon publication].

Next, I will ensure that I have the correct format for the citations, as they are crucial for proper referencing. The citations should include the authors, title, and a note about the dataset's availability upon publication.

Finally, I will summarize the findings and prepare the dataset entries for further processing or review, ensuring that all necessary details are included for each dataset extracted from the paper.
