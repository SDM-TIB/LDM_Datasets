To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Target Speech Extraction with Pre-Trained Self-Supervised Learning Models" by Junyi Peng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the use of pre-trained self-supervised learning models for target speech extraction, but it does not specify any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors discuss the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they explicitly mention the **Libri2Mix dataset**, which consists of simulated mixtures of two speakers. This is a crucial dataset for their experiments, and I will need to gather more details about it.

In the same section, the authors describe how the Libri2Mix dataset is partitioned into three subsets: train-100, dev, and test. This information is important for understanding the dataset's structure and usage in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Libri2Mix dataset. The relevant citation is:

- For **Libri2Mix dataset**, the citation is:
  > Joris Cosentino, Manuel Pariente, Samuele Cornell, Antoine Deleforge, and Emmanuel Vincent. *Librimix: An open-source dataset for generalizable speech separation*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2005.11262, 2020.

Since this is the only dataset mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and citation.

After completing this process, I will ensure that the dataset entry is ready for review or further processing, emphasizing the importance of including the full citation for proper attribution.
