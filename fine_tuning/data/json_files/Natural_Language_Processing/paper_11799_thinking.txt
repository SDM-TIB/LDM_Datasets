To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The mapKurator System: A Complete Pipeline for Extracting and Linking Text from Historical Maps" by Jina Kim et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract highlights the processing of over 60,000 maps and over 100 million text/place names from the David Rumsey Historical Map collection, indicating that this collection is a significant dataset.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any specific mentions of datasets. The authors reference the David Rumsey Map Collection as one of the largest collections of scanned historical maps, which is crucial for my dataset extraction.

In the **methodology section**, I will look for detailed descriptions of any datasets used in the experiments or system evaluations. The authors mention using a "novel synthetic map dataset designed to mimic text placement on historical maps," which suggests that this synthetic dataset is important for their text-spotting model.

I will also check the **results and discussion sections** for any additional datasets that may have been utilized or referenced. The paper discusses the integration of the mapKurator system with a collaborative web platform and mentions processing thousands of Sanborn Fire Insurance maps and historical Ordinance Survey maps, indicating these are additional datasets of interest.

Now, I will compile the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper:

1. **David Rumsey Historical Map Collection**: This dataset is referenced multiple times throughout the paper. The citation is:
   > David Rumsey and Meredith Williams. *Historical maps in GIS*. 2002.

2. **Synthetic Map Dataset**: While the paper does not provide a specific citation for this dataset, it is mentioned in the context of training their text spotter model. I will note that it is a novel dataset created for the study.

3. **Sanborn Fire Insurance Maps**: The citation for the original dataset is:
   > Sanborn Map Company. *Sanborn Fire Insurance Maps*. Various years.

4. **Historical Ordinance Survey Maps**: The citation for this dataset is:
   > National Library of Scotland. *Ordnance Survey Maps*. Various years.

After gathering this information, I will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations, ready to format them according to the required structure for further processing or review.
