To extract datasets from the research paper titled "GV-Bench: Benchmarking Local Feature Matching for Geometric Verification of Long-term Loop Closure Detection" by Jingwen Yu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the paper proposes a benchmark built upon three datasets, which suggests that these datasets are crucial to the research.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any relevant subsections within the **methodology** or **evaluation** sections. In this paper, the authors mention three datasets used for their benchmark: the **Oxford RobotCar dataset**, the **Nordland dataset**, and the **UAcampus dataset**. I will take note of the details provided about each dataset, including how they were used in the experiments.

In the **evaluation methodology section**, the authors describe how they utilized these datasets to create sequences that account for various conditional variations. This section provides valuable context for understanding the datasets' significance in the research.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset from the **references section** of the paper. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily. The citations I need to extract are:

1. **Oxford RobotCar Dataset**:
   > W. Maddern, G. Pascoe, C. Linegar, and P. Newman. "1 year, 1000 km: The Oxford RobotCar dataset." *International Journal of Robotics Research (IJRR)*, vol. 36, no. 1, pp. 3–15, 2017.

2. **Nordland Dataset**:
   > S. Skrede. "Nordland dataset." Available online: https://bit.ly/2QVBOym, 2013.

3. **UAcampus Dataset**:
   > Y. Liu, R. Feng, and H. Zhang. "Keypoint matching by outlier pruning with consensus constraint." In *Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation*, pp. 5481–5486, 2015.

After collecting this information, I will summarize the datasets, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that I maintain clarity and accuracy in the representation of each dataset's role in the research.

Finally, I will compile all the dataset entries into a structured format that is ready for review or further processing, ensuring that each dataset is clearly identified and properly cited.
