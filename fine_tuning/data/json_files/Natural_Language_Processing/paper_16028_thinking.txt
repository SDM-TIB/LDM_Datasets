To extract the datasets mentioned in the paper titled "LocaliseBot: Multi-view 3D object localisation with differentiable rendering for robot grasping" by Sujal Vijayaraghavan et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. In the abstract, the authors mention evaluating their method on the **ShapeNet dataset** and the **Object Clutter Indoor Dataset (OCID) Grasp dataset**. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for their experiments.

Next, I will look closely at **section 4 (Experiments)**, particularly **section 4.2 (Dataset)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used:

1. **ShapeNet Dataset**: The authors do not provide extensive details in the paper, but it is a well-known dataset in the field of 3D object recognition and pose estimation.

2. **Object Clutter Indoor Dataset (OCID)**: This dataset is described as containing 96 cluttered scenes, 89 different objects, and over 2,000 point cloud annotations. The authors also mention the **OCID Grasp dataset**, which consists of 1,763 RGB-D images filtered from OCID, containing over 11,400 segmented masks and over 75,000 grasp candidates.

In the **References section**, I will find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **ShapeNet dataset**, the citation is:

- For the **Object Clutter Indoor Dataset (OCID)**, the citation is:
  > Suchi, M., Patten, T., Fischinger, D., & Vincze, M. (2019). *Easylabel: A semi-automatic pixel-wise object annotation tool for creating robotic RGB-D datasets*. In Proceedings of the 2019 International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA), pp. 6678–6684. IEEE.

- For the **OCID Grasp dataset**, the citation is:

Now, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all necessary information is accurately represented for future reference or processing.
