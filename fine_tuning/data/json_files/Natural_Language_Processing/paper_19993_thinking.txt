To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The Impact of Frequency Bands on Acoustic Anomaly Detection of Machines using Deep Learning Based Model" by Tin Nguyen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on the **DCASE 2022 Task 2 Development set**, which indicates that this is a key dataset used in their research.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (Section IV) where the authors explicitly discuss the datasets used. They describe the **DCASE 2022 Challenge Task 2 Development set**, detailing that it consists of 10-second audio recordings collected from seven different machine types: ‘Bearing’, ‘Fan’, ‘Gearbox’, ‘Slider’, ‘ToyCar’, ‘ToyTrain’, and ‘Valve’. Each machine type has separate training and testing subsets.

In this section, the authors provide further details about the structure of the dataset, including the number of recordings for each machine type and the division into training and testing subsets. This information is crucial for understanding how the dataset is utilized in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the DCASE 2022 Task 2 Development set. The relevant citation is:

- For **DCASE 2022 Task 2 Development set**, the citation is:
  > Kota Dohi et al. "Description and discussion on DCASE 2022 challenge task 2: Unsupervised anomalous sound detection for machine condition monitoring applying domain generalization techniques." In Proceedings of the DCASE, 2022, pp. 1–5.

Having gathered all necessary information, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring that I include the full citation as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the dataset used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
