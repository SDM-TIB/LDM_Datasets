To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CRYSFORMER: Protein Structure Prediction via 3D Patterson Maps and Partial Structure Attention" by Chen Dun et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors propose two new datasets of peptide fragments (2-residue and 15-residue) to demonstrate their method, CrysFormer. This is a strong indication that I need to look for more details about these datasets.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section. Here, the authors discuss the importance of protein crystallography and mention their datasets again, emphasizing their contribution to the field. This reinforces the need to gather specific details about the datasets.

I will then focus on the **datasets section (Section 4)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the two datasets they created:

1. **Dipeptide Dataset**: This dataset consists of peptide fragments containing 2 residues. The authors explain how they generated this dataset from a curated basis of approximately 24,000 protein structures from the Protein Data Bank (PDB). They describe the process of selecting and storing segments of adjacent amino acid residues, ensuring that the dataset is suitable for their experiments.

2. **15-Residue Dataset**: This dataset includes peptide fragments containing 15 residues. The authors detail how they created this dataset, including the criteria for selecting protein structures and the modifications made to ensure data quality. They also mention that this dataset is more challenging due to its smaller size and complexity.

In the **experiments section**, the authors confirm that they used both the dipeptide and 15-residue datasets for their evaluations, which validates the datasets' relevance to their research.

Next, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The authors refer to the Protein Data Bank (PDB) as the source of their data, which is crucial for proper citation. The citation for the PDB is:

- **Protein Data Bank (PDB)**: 
  > wwPDB consortium. *Protein Data Bank: the single global archive for 3D macromolecular structure data*. Nucleic Acids Research, 47(D1):D520–D528, 2019. doi: 10.1093/nar/gky949. URL: https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gky949.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their descriptions and citations:

1. **Dipeptide Dataset**:
   - Description: A dataset of peptide fragments containing 2 residues, generated from approximately 24,000 protein structures from the Protein Data Bank (PDB).
   - Citation: wwPDB consortium. *Protein Data Bank: the single global archive for 3D macromolecular structure data*. Nucleic Acids Research, 47(D1):D520–D528, 2019. doi: 10.1093/nar/gky949. URL: https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gky949.

2. **15-Residue Dataset**:
   - Description: A dataset of peptide fragments containing 15 residues, created from a subset of PDB entries, with specific criteria for selection and modifications to ensure data quality.
   - Citation: wwPDB consortium. *Protein Data Bank: the single global archive for 3D macromolecular structure data*. Nucleic Acids Research, 47(D1):D520–D528, 2019. doi: 10.1093/nar/gky949. URL: https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gky949.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for further processing or review.
