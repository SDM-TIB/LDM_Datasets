To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fine-Tuning Llama 2 Large Language Models for Detecting Online Sexual Predatory Chats and Abusive Texts" by Thanh Thi Nguyen, Campbell Wilson, and Janis Dalins, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and datasets section** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors fine-tuned their model using datasets of varying sizes and languages, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **Section III (Datasets and Performance Metrics)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention three datasets:

1. **PAN 2012 Dataset**: This dataset is used for detecting sexual predatory chats and is described as containing hundreds of thousands of conversations, with specific details about the types of data included (true positives, false positives, and false negatives). 

2. **Roman Urdu Dataset**: This dataset consists of 147,180 comments from YouTube videos, labeled as abusive or non-abusive. The authors mention that they randomly extracted 10,000 data points for validation.

3. **Urdu Dataset**: This dataset was manually collected from YouTube comments in Urdu, containing 2,170 comments annotated as abusive or non-abusive.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For the **PAN 2012 Dataset**, the citation is:
> G. Inches and F. Crestani. *PAN12 Deception Detection: Sexual Predator Identification*. Sep. 2012. [Online]. Available: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3713280

For the **Roman Urdu Dataset**, the citation is:
> Shaheer Akram. *Roman Urdu Abusive Comment Detector*. Available: https://github.com/shaheerakr/roman-urdu-abusive-comment-detector.

For the **Urdu Dataset**, the citation is:
> Pervez BCS. *Urdu Abusive Dataset*. Available: https://github.com/pervezbcs/Urdu-Abusive-Dataset.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This will ensure that the datasets are accurately represented and properly cited.
