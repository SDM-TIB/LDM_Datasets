To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Video Action Recognition Collaborative Learning with Dynamics via PSO-ConvNet Transformer" by Nguyen Huu Phong and Bernardete Ribeiro, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the experimental results were conducted on the **UCF-101 dataset**, which is a strong indication that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **Results section** where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they describe three datasets:

1. **UCF-101 Dataset**: This dataset is noted for containing 13,320 realistic video clips across 101 action categories. It is a well-known benchmark in the field of action recognition.

2. **HMDB-51 Dataset**: This dataset consists of approximately 5,000 videos categorized into 51 distinct action classes. Each class has at least 100 videos, and the videos are sourced from various platforms, including movies and online videos.

3. **Kinetics-400 Dataset**: This dataset includes 400 human action classes, with at least 400 video clips for each action. It is one of the largest well-annotated video datasets available, containing around 240,000 training videos and 20,000 validation videos.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper. The citations I find are:

- For **UCF-101 Dataset**:
  > Soomro, K., Zamir, A. R., & Shah, M. (2012). *UCF101: A dataset of 101 human actions classes from videos in the wild*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1212.0402.

- For **HMDB-51 Dataset**:
  > Kuehne, H., Jhuang, H., Garrote, E., Poggio, T., & Serre, T. (2011). *HMDB: A large video database for human motion recognition*. In 2011 International conference on computer vision (pp. 2556-2563). IEEE.

- For **Kinetics-400 Dataset**:
  > Kay, W. et al. (2017). *The kinetics human action video dataset*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1705.06950.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or analysis. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets referenced in the paper along with their proper citations.
