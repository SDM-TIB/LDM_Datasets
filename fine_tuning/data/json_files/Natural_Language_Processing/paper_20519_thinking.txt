To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Selecting informative conformal prediction sets with false coverage rate control" by Ulysse Gazin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

1. **Read the Paper Thoroughly**: I will start by reading through the entire paper, paying special attention to sections that typically contain dataset information, such as the **Introduction**, **Methods**, **Experiments**, and **Results** sections. These sections often provide insights into the datasets used for validation or experimentation.

2. **Identify Explicit Mentions of Datasets**: As I read, I will look for explicit mentions of datasets. This includes names of datasets, descriptions of their contents, and any relevant details such as the number of samples, features, or specific characteristics that define the dataset.

3. **Look for Figures and Tables**: I will also check any figures or tables that may summarize the datasets or provide additional context about their usage in the experiments. These visual aids often contain critical information that may not be fully described in the text.

4. **Check the References Section**: After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References** section of the paper to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

5. **Document Each Dataset**: For each dataset identified, I will document the following:
   - **Name of the Dataset**: The official name as mentioned in the paper.
   - **Description**: A brief description of the dataset, including its purpose and any relevant characteristics.
   - **Full Citation**: The complete reference for the dataset, including authors, title, publication venue, and year.

6. **Compile the Information**: Finally, I will compile all the extracted information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly defined and properly cited.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets referenced in the paper, maintaining a focus on clarity and proper citation practices.
