To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "LLMs can Find Mathematical Reasoning Mistakes by Pedagogical Chain-of-Thought" by Zhuoxuan Jiang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their approach on **two public datasets featuring math problems of varying difficulty levels**, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experiment)**, where the authors provide a summary of the datasets used. Here, they mention two datasets:

1. **BIG-Bench Mistake**: This dataset consists of 2,186 reasoning traces generated by PALM-2, focusing on mathematical problems. It includes 1,506 reasoning steps across 300 answer traces, primarily involving multi-step arithmetic calculations.

2. **PRM800K**: This dataset contains about 800,000 step-level labels over 75,000 solutions for math word problems from high-school competitions. The authors selected a subset of 300 pairs of problems and their reasoning answer traces for their experiments.

In the **statistics table (Table 1)**, the authors provide additional details about each dataset, including the total number of traces, total steps, average trace length, average steps of the first mistake, and the percentage of correct traces.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The authors reference the original sources for both datasets:

- For the **BIG-Bench Mistake dataset**, the citation is:
  > Tyen, G., Mansoor, H., Chen, P., Mak, T., & CË˜arbune, V. (2023). *LLMs cannot find reasoning errors, but can correct them!* arXiv preprint arXiv:2311.08516.

- For the **PRM800K dataset**, the citation is:
  > Hendrycks, D., Burns, C., Kadavath, S., Arora, A., Basart, S., Tang, E., Song, D., & Steinhardt, J. (2021). *Measuring mathematical problem solving with the math dataset.* arXiv preprint arXiv:2103.03874.

With this information, I can now compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This structured approach ensures that I accurately capture all relevant details about the datasets used in the research.
