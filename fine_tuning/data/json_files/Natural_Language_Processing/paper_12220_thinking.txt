To extract datasets from the research paper titled "FedCME: Client Matching and Classifier Exchanging to Handle Data Heterogeneity in Federated Learning" by Jun Nie et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** sections to get an overview of the paper's focus and any datasets that may be referenced. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on popular federated learning benchmarks, specifically **FMNIST** and **CIFAR10**. This indicates that these datasets are likely to be discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology or experiments sections**. In this paper, the datasets are mentioned in the **experiments section** where the authors state that they conducted extensive experiments using **FMNIST** and **CIFAR10**. This confirms that these two datasets are the primary focus of their experimental evaluations.

Now, I will gather detailed information about each dataset, including their characteristics and any relevant citations. The paper provides some context about the datasets:

1. **FMNIST**: This dataset is a fashion product dataset that serves as a drop-in replacement for the MNIST dataset. It consists of 70,000 grayscale images of clothing items, divided into 10 categories.

2. **CIFAR10**: This dataset contains 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes, with 6,000 images per class. It is widely used for benchmarking machine learning algorithms.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **FMNIST**, the citation is:
  > H. Xiao, K. Rashtchian, et al. *Fashion-MNIST: A Novel Image Dataset for Benchmarking Machine Learning Algorithms*. Arxiv, p. abs/1708.07747, 2017.

- For **CIFAR10**, the citation is:
  > A. Krizhevsky, I. Sutskever, et al. *Imagenet Classification with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks*. In Neural Information Processing Systems, NeurIPS, 2012.

Having gathered this information, I will now compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
