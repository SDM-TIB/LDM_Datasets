To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ChangeMamba: Remote Sensing Change Detection with Spatio-Temporal State Space Model" by Hongruixuan Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their methods on **five benchmark datasets**, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section IV), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they provide a table summarizing the datasets, including their names, study sites, number of image pairs, sizes, resolutions, and evaluation tasks.

The datasets mentioned in the paper are:

1. **SYSU-CD**: This dataset consists of 20,000 pairs of 0.5 meter/pixel resolution aerial images from Hong Kong, focusing on urban and coastal changes.

2. **LEVIR-CD+**: An advanced version of the LEVIR-CD dataset, containing 985 pairs of very high-resolution images at 0.5 meters/pixel, documenting significant building construction changes.

3. **WHU-CD**: A subset of the WHU Building dataset, comprising two aerial datasets from Christchurch, New Zealand, with a spatial resolution of 0.3 meters/pixel.

4. **SECOND**: This dataset includes 4,662 pairs of 512 Ã— 512 aerial images at varying resolutions, annotated for semantic change detection in urban areas.

5. **xBD**: A dataset for building damage assessment, integrating pre- and post-disaster satellite imagery with over 850,000 building annotations.
   - Citation:

After identifying these datasets and their citations, I will compile the information into a structured format for easy reference. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations for future use or analysis.
