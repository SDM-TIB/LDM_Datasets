To extract datasets from the research paper titled "BloomVQA: Assessing Hierarchical Multi-modal Comprehension" by Yunye Gong et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the datasets discussed. The abstract mentions the creation of a novel VQA dataset called **BloomVQA**, which is a strong indication that this is the primary dataset of interest.

Next, I will look for specific sections that detail the dataset. In this case, the **Datasets** section is likely to provide comprehensive information. I will focus on the **Methods** and **Experimental Analysis** sections as well, as they may contain additional insights about the dataset's structure, usage, and any related datasets.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors describe the **BloomVQA dataset** in detail. They mention that it consists of 1200 core data samples collected from human annotators based on 20 stories, categorized into 6 levels according to Bloom's Taxonomy. This dataset is designed for evaluating multi-modal comprehension tasks.

I will also check the **References** section to find the full citation for the **BloomVQA dataset**. The paper states that the dataset can be accessed at a specific URL, which is important for providing a complete citation.

The citation for the **BloomVQA dataset** is:
> Yunye Gong, Robik Shrestha, Jared Claypoole, Michael Cogswell, Arijit Ray, Christopher Kanan, and Ajay Divakaran. *BloomVQA: Assessing Hierarchical Multi-modal Comprehension*. In Proceedings of the Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), 2023. Available at: https://huggingface.co/datasets/ygong/BloomVQA.

Now, I will compile the information about the dataset into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and full citation. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the dataset extracted from the paper.
