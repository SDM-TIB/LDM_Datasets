To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Affect Enriched Word Embeddings for News Information Retrieval" by Tommaso Teofili and Niyati Chhaya, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method on the **New York Times dataset (TREC-core '17)**, which suggests that this dataset is significant for their research.

Next, I will examine **section 1 (Introduction)**, where the authors discuss the use of word embeddings in information retrieval and mention the datasets used for evaluation. They specifically refer to the **New York Times dataset** and the **Washington Post articles** as part of their preliminary evaluation of affect scores.

In **section 1.1**, the authors detail the datasets used for affect scoring, which includes:

1. **New York Times dataset (TREC-core '17)**: This dataset is used for evaluating the effectiveness of their proposed embeddings in the context of information retrieval.
2. **Washington Post articles**: Another dataset used for the same purpose.
3. **ClueWeb09 dataset**: This dataset contains text from HTML pages crawled from the web and is used for affect scoring.
4. **CACM dataset**: A collection of titles and abstracts from the CACM journal, also used for affect scoring.

In the **Experiments section**, the authors confirm that they conducted experiments using the **New York Times dataset** and **CACM dataset**, further validating their importance in the study.

Now, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

- For the **New York Times dataset (TREC-core '17)**, the citation is:
  > James Allan, Donna Harman, Evangelos Kanoulas, Dan Li, Christophe Van Gysel, and Ellen Vorhees. *Trec 2017 common core track overview*. In Proc. TREC, 2017.

- For the **Washington Post articles**, there is no specific citation provided in the references, but it is commonly known as part of the TREC datasets.

- For the **ClueWeb09 dataset**, the citation is:
  > Jamie Callan, Mark Hoy, Changkuk Yoo, and Le Zhao. *Clueweb09 data set*, 2009.

- For the **CACM dataset**, the citation is:
  > Edward A Fox. *Characterization of two new experimental collections in computer and information science containing textual and bibliographic concepts*. Technical report, Cornell University, 1983.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will prepare the information for structured output or further analysis.
