To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Caduceus: Bi-Directional Equivariant Long-Range DNA Sequence Modeling" by Yair Schiff et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that Caduceus outperforms previous models on downstream benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved. I will look for specific mentions of datasets in these sections.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for pre-training and evaluation. In this paper, the authors mention several datasets:

1. **HG38 Human Reference Genome**: This dataset is used for pre-training the Caduceus model. It is a standard reference genome for human genetics.
   
2. **Genomics Benchmark**: This dataset is referenced as coming from Greˇsov´a et al. (2023) and is used for evaluating the model's performance on various genomic tasks.

3. **Nucleotide Transformer Benchmark**: Introduced in Dalla-Torre et al. (2023), this dataset is used for benchmarking the performance of the Caduceus model against other models.

4. **Variant Effect Prediction Dataset**: This dataset is derived from the Enformer paper (Avsec et al., 2021) and is used to predict the effects of genetic variants on gene expression. The modified version of this dataset is referenced in Trop et al. (2023).

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset from the **References section** of the paper:

- For the **HG38 Human Reference Genome**, the citation is:
  > Consortium, G. R. et al. *Genome reference consortium human build 37 (grch37)*. Database (GenBank or RefSeq), 2009.

- For the **Genomics Benchmark**, the citation is:
  > Greˇsov´a, K., Martinek, V., ˇCech´ak, D., ˇSimeˇcek, P., and Alexiou, P. *Genomic benchmarks: a collection of datasets for genomic sequence classification*. BMC Genomic Data, 24(1):25, 2023.

- For the **Nucleotide Transformer Benchmark**, the citation is:
  > Dalla-Torre, H., Gonzalez, L., Mendoza-Revilla, J., Carranza, N. L., Grzywaczewski, A. H., Oteri, F., Dallago, C., Trop, E., de Almeida, B. P., Sirelkhatim, H., et al. *The nucleotide transformer: Building and evaluating robust foundation models for human genomics*. bioRxiv, pp. 2023–01, 2023.

- For the **Variant Effect Prediction Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Avsec, ˇZ., Agarwal, V., Visentin, D., Ledsam, J. R., Grabska-Barwinska, A., Taylor, K. R., Assael, Y., Jumper, J., Kohli, P., and Kelley, D. R. *Effective gene expression prediction from sequence by integrating long-range interactions*. Nature methods, 18(10):1196–1203, 2021.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
