To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Proprioception Is All You Need: Terrain Classification for Boreal Forests" by Damien LaRocque et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are mentioned. The abstract introduces **BorealTC**, a publicly available dataset for proprioceptive-based terrain classification, which is a clear indication that a dataset is present.

Next, I will look into the **methodology** and **experiments** sections, particularly focusing on the **dataset description** part. Here, the authors provide detailed information about the BorealTC dataset, including the types of terrains it covers (ASPHALT, ICE, SILTY LOAM, and SNOW) and the conditions under which the data was collected. They mention that the dataset was recorded with a Husky A200 robot and includes various sensor data types.

In the **dataset description**, I will note the specifics of the BorealTC dataset:
- It contains 116 minutes of data focusing on terrains typical of boreal forests.
- The dataset includes IMU, motor current, and wheel odometry data.

Additionally, the authors mention that they used another dataset, the **Vulpi dataset**, for comparison in their experiments. I will need to gather information about this dataset as well.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for both datasets:

1. For the **BorealTC dataset**, since it is introduced in this paper, I will cite it as:
   > Damien LaRocque, William Guimont-Martin, David-Alexandre Duclos, Philippe Giguère, François Pomerleau. *Proprioception Is All You Need: Terrain Classification for Boreal Forests*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA), 2024.

2. For the **Vulpi dataset**, I will look for its citation in the references. The relevant citation is:
   > F. Vulpi, A. Milella, R. Marani, and G. Reina. *Recurrent and convolutional neural networks for deep terrain classification by autonomous robots*. Journal of Terramechanics, vol. 96, pp. 119–131, Aug. 2021.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

- **BorealTC Dataset**: A dataset for terrain classification in boreal forests, recorded with a Husky A200, containing IMU, motor current, and wheel odometry data across various terrains.
- **Vulpi Dataset**: A dataset used for comparison, focusing on terrain classification with similar methodologies.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
