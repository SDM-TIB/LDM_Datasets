To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Constructing Custom Thermodynamics Using Deep Learning" by Xiaoli Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the development of a platform for learning macroscopic dynamical descriptions from microscopic trajectories, which suggests that there are datasets related to these trajectories. I will look for specific mentions of datasets or experiments in these sections.

Next, I will move to the **methods** section, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this paper, the authors detail the simulation data and experimental data. I will extract the relevant information about these datasets:

1. **Simulation Data**: The authors describe the simulation of polymer chain stretching in a planar elongational flow. They mention that they generated 610 stretching trajectories, each consisting of 1001 time snapshots of the polymer chain's configuration. This dataset is crucial for their analysis.

2. **Experimental Data**: The authors also describe the experimental setup for stretching DNA molecules using a microfluidic device. They mention that the experimental data is used to validate their predictions and that the data is publicly available in the Harvard Dataverse repository.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper references other works that may provide additional context or data sources.

For the **simulation data**, the authors do not provide a specific citation since it is generated based on their own methods. However, I will note that the data is derived from their simulations.

For the **experimental data**, the authors reference their own previous work, which is:
- Soh, B.W., Ooi, Z.-E., Vissol-Gaudin, E., Leong, C.J., Hippalgaonkar, K.: Automated electrokinetic stretcher for manipulating nanomaterials. *Lab on a Chip* 23, 3716–3726 (2023). This citation will be included for the experimental dataset.

Now, I will compile the extracted datasets with their respective citations:

1. **Simulation Data**: 
   - Description: 610 stretching trajectories of polymer chains, each with 1001 time snapshots.
   - Citation: Not applicable (generated by the authors).

2. **Experimental Data**: 
   - Description: Data from single-molecule stretching experiments of DNA in a microfluidic device.
   - Citation: Soh, B.W., Ooi, Z.-E., Vissol-Gaudin, E., Leong, C.J., Hippalgaonkar, K.: Automated electrokinetic stretcher for manipulating nanomaterials. *Lab on a Chip* 23, 3716–3726 (2023).

Finally, I will ensure that I have accurately documented the datasets and their citations for any further processing or review.
