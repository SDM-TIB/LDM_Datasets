To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ToxiCloakCN: Evaluating Robustness of Offensive Language Detection in Chinese with Cloaking Perturbations" by Yunze Xiao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract introduces **ToxiCloakCN**, which is derived from **ToxiCN**, indicating that these are the primary datasets of interest.

Next, I will look into **section 2 (Related Work)**, where the authors discuss several datasets relevant to Chinese offensive language detection. Here, I will note the following datasets:

1. **Chinese Offensive Language Dataset (COLD)**: This dataset categorizes sentences into various groups related to offensive language.
2. **TOCP and TOCAB**: These datasets focus on profanity and abusive language from Taiwan's PTT platform.
3. **Sina Weibo Sexism Review (SWSR)**: This dataset targets sexism in Chinese social media.
4. **ToxiCN**: This dataset includes a multi-level labeling system for offensive language and hate speech.

In **section 3 (Methodology)**, the authors detail how they constructed the **ToxiCloakCN** dataset from the **ToxiCN** dataset by applying perturbation techniques. This section confirms that **ToxiCloakCN** is a new dataset created for their experiments.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper from the **References section**:

- For **COLD**, the citation is:

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
