To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Is Factuality Decoding a Free Lunch for LLMs? Evaluation on Knowledge Editing Benchmark" by Baolong Bi et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions evaluating several strong factuality decoding methods on the **knowledge editing benchmark**, which suggests that there may be specific datasets used for this evaluation.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Multi-hop Knowledge Editing Benchmark)**, where the authors introduce the **MQUAKE-CF-3k dataset**. This section provides details about the dataset, including that it comprises 3,000 instances derived from paths extracted from Wikidata, which consists of fact triples associated with millions of entities. This is a clear indication that this dataset is central to their experiments.

In **section 4.2 (Datasets)**, the authors provide statistics about the MQUAKE-CF-3k dataset, confirming its relevance and usage in their experiments. They describe the dataset as providing multi-hop fact questions with fact chains, along with the answers before and after editing, which are crucial for evaluating knowledge editing.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the MQUAKE-CF-3k dataset. The citation is:
> Zexuan Zhong, Zhengxuan Wu, Christopher D. Manning, Christopher Potts, and Danqi Chen. *Mquake: Assessing knowledge editing in language models via multi-hop questions*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2305.14795, 2023.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets explicitly, I will focus solely on the MQUAKE-CF-3k dataset for my extraction.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring to include the full citation as required. This structured approach ensures that I accurately capture the necessary information regarding the dataset used in the research paper.
