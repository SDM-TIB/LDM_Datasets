To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Business and ethical concerns in domestic Conversational Generative AI-empowered multi-robot systems" by Rebekah Rousi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract discusses the ethical implications of Conversational Generative AI (CGI) in multi-robot systems, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. The introduction elaborates on the significance of CGI in various sectors, including robotics, but again does not reference specific datasets.

Next, I will delve into the **methodology section**. This section describes the qualitative explorative method used in the study, including workshops and scenario-based approaches. However, it does not indicate the use of any external datasets for analysis or experimentation.

I will then review the **results and discussion sections**. These sections summarize the findings from the workshops and thematic analysis but do not mention any datasets. The focus is primarily on ethical concerns and implications rather than empirical data derived from specific datasets.

Finally, I will check the **references section** to see if any datasets are cited indirectly through referenced works. However, the references primarily consist of literature discussing AI ethics, multi-robot cooperation, and related topics, without specific datasets being highlighted.

After thoroughly reviewing the paper, it appears that there are no explicit datasets mentioned or utilized in the research. The study is more focused on qualitative insights and ethical considerations rather than quantitative data derived from datasets.

Since no datasets were identified, I will not be able to provide full citations for any datasets as none exist in this paper. My next step will be to summarize the findings and implications discussed in the paper, focusing on the ethical concerns raised regarding CGI-empowered multi-robot systems.
