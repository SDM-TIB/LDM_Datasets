To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Comparing LLM prompting with Cross-lingual transfer performance on Indigenous and Low-resource Brazilian Languages" by David Ifeoluwa Adelani et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study focuses on 12 low-resource languages (LRLs) from Brazil and mentions the use of the Bible corpora for some languages, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will examine **section 3 (Experimental setup)**, particularly **subsection 3.1 (Evaluation Datasets)**, where the authors provide a detailed table (Table 1) listing the languages evaluated, their language families, and the datasets used. This section is crucial as it explicitly outlines the datasets associated with each language.

From the table, I can identify the following datasets:

1. **Universal Dependencies (UD) datasets** for various Brazilian LRLs, including:
   - **Apurina (apu)**: Dataset name is "apu ufpa".
   - **Akuntsu (aqz)**: Dataset name is "aqz tudet".
   - **Bororo (bor)**: Dataset name is "bor bdt".
   - **Guajajara (gub)**: Dataset name is "gub tudet".
   - **Madi-Jarawara (jaa)**: Dataset name is "jaa jarawara".
   - **Makurap (mpu)**: Dataset name is "mpu tudet".
   - **Munduruku (myu)**: Dataset name is "myu tudet".
   - **Tupinamba (tpn)**: Dataset name is "tpn tudet".
   - **Kaapor (urb)**: Dataset name is "urb tudet".
   - **Xavante (xav)**: Dataset name is "xav xdt".
   - **Nheengatu (yrl)**: Dataset name is "yrl complin".

2. **Bible Corpora**: The authors mention that they collected Bible corpora for several languages, which are used for language adaptation. The sizes of these corpora vary, and they are noted in the table.

Now, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the Universal Dependencies datasets are typically found in the respective papers or resources associated with the UD project. For the Bible corpora, I will refer to the citation provided by Akerman et al. (2023) in the references.

The citations I will include are:

- For **Universal Dependencies**:
  > Zeman, D., Nivre, J., Abrams, M., Ackermann, E., Aepli, N., Aghaei, H., et al. (2023). *Universal dependencies 2.13*. LINDAT/CLARIAH-CZ digital library at the Institute of Formal and Applied Linguistics (UFAL), Faculty of Mathematics and Physics, Charles University.

- For **Bible Corpora**:
  > Akerman, V., Baines, D., Daspit, D., Hermjakob, U., Jang, T. Y., Leong, C., et al. (2023). *The ebible corpus: Data and model benchmarks for bible translation for low-resource languages*. ArXiv, abs/2304.09919.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
