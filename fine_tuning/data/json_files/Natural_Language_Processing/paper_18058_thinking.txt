To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Space and Time Continuous Physics Simulation from Partial Observations" by Steeven Janny et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors evaluate their method on **three standard datasets in fluid dynamics**, which indicates that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically provide detailed information about the datasets used. In this section, they mention the following datasets:

1. **Navier Dataset**: This dataset simulates the vorticity of a viscous, incompressible flow driven by a sinusoidal force acting on a square domain with periodic boundary conditions. It consists of 256 training simulations of 40 frames each, with additional simulations for validation and testing.

2. **Shallow Water Dataset**: This dataset studies the velocity of shallow waters evolving on the tangent surface of a 3D sphere. It includes 64 training simulations, along with 16 simulations for validation and testing, with sequences of length 20.

3. **Eagle Dataset**: This dataset simulates the airflow generated by a drone within a 2D room. It consists of sequences of length 10 extracted from examples within the dataset, limiting the number of points to 3,000.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **Navier Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yin, M., Kirchmeyer, M., Franceschi, J.-Y., Rakotomamonjy, A., et al. *Continuous PDE Dynamics Forecasting with Implicit Neural Representations*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR), 2022.

- For the **Shallow Water Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Galewsky, J., Scott, R. K., & Polvani, L. M. *An Initial-Value Problem for Testing Numerical Models of the Global Shallow-Water Equations*. Tellus A: Dynamic Meteorology and Oceanography, 2004.

- For the **Eagle Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Janny, S., Baradel, F., Neverova, N., Nadri, M., Mori, G., & Wolf, C. *Eagle: Large-Scale Learning of Turbulent Fluid Dynamics with Mesh Transformers*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR), 2023.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all relevant details are accurately represented for future reference or processing.
