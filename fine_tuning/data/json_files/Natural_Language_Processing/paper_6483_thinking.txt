To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Do Not Fire the Linguist: Grammatical Profiles Help Language Models Detect Semantic Change" by Mario Giulianelli et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors compare the performance of grammatical profiles against a multilingual neural language model (XLM-R) on **10 datasets covering 7 languages**. This suggests that multiple datasets are involved, and I need to find their specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **Tasks and Data** section (Section 2), where the authors provide a detailed description of the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention that they rely on a collection of diachronic corpora and annotated target word lists covering seven languages from three Indo-European language families. They specifically list the datasets used for English, German, Latin, Swedish, Italian, Norwegian, and Russian.

The datasets mentioned are:

1. **SemEval 2020 Unsupervised Lexical Semantic Change Detection**: This dataset includes English (EN), German (DE), Latin (LA), and Swedish (SW) data.
2. **EvaLita competition dataset**: This dataset is used for Italian (IT).
3. **NorDiaChange dataset**: This dataset is for Norwegian (NO), consisting of two subsets with different target word lists and time spans.
4. **RuShiftEval shared task dataset**: This dataset is for Russian (RU), consisting of three subsets with different time spans and a shared target word list.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for the datasets used in the research.

The citations I will look for include:

- For the **SemEval 2020 dataset**, I will find the citation for the shared task paper:
  > Dominik Schlechtweg, Barbara McGillivray, Simon Hengchen, Haim Dubossarsky, and Nina Tahmasebi. *SemEval-2020 task 1: Unsupervised lexical semantic change detection*. In Proceedings of the Fourteenth Workshop on Semantic Evaluation, pages 1–23, Barcelona (online). International Committee for Computational Linguistics, 2020.

- For the **EvaLita competition dataset**, I will find the citation:
  > Pierpaolo Basile, Annalina Caputo, Tommaso Caselli, Pierluigi Cassotti, and Rossella Varvara. *DIACR-Ita @ EVALITA2020: Overview of the EVALITA2020 Diachronic Lexical Semantics Task*. In Proceedings of the Seventh Evaluation Campaign of Natural Language Processing and Speech Tools for Italian. Final Workshop (EVALITA 2020) CEUR Workshop Proceedings (CEUR-WS.org), 2020.

- For the **NorDiaChange dataset**, I will find the citation:
  > Andrey Kutuzov, Samia Touileb, Petter Mæhlum, Tita Ranveig Enstad, and Alexandra Wittemann. *NorDiaChange: Diachronic semantic change dataset for Norwegian*. In Proceedings of the 13th Language Resources and Evaluation Conference (LREC). European Language Resources Association, 2022.

- For the **RuShiftEval dataset**, I will find the citation:
  > Andrey Kutuzov and Lidia Pivovarova. *RuShiftEval: a shared task on semantic shift detection for Russian*. In Computational linguistics and intellectual technologies: Papers from the annual conference Dialogue, 2021.

After gathering the dataset names and their corresponding citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset, its description, and the full citation. This will ensure that the datasets are accurately represented and properly attributed in any subsequent analysis or reporting.
