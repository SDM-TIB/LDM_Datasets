To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Beyond Robustness Against Single Attack Types" by Sihui Dai et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections discussing experiments or methodologies** to identify any datasets that are explicitly referenced. The abstract provides a high-level overview, but I will focus on the introduction and subsequent sections for detailed mentions of datasets.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss various attack types and defenses but do not mention specific datasets. I will then proceed to the **background and subsequent sections** where they might describe experiments or evaluations that typically involve datasets.

As I read through the paper, I will pay special attention to any **figures, tables, or sections labeled as "Datasets" or "Experiments"**. These sections often contain crucial information about the datasets used in the research.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors reference several datasets indirectly through the discussion of various attack types and defenses, but they do not explicitly mention any specific datasets used for their experiments. Instead, they cite prior works that may have used datasets relevant to their discussion.

Next, I will check the **References section** to see if any of the cited works include datasets. For example, they reference works that discuss adversarial training and robustness, which may have associated datasets. I will look for full citations of these works to ensure I can accurately document any datasets they might have used.

After compiling the relevant citations, I will format them properly. For instance, if a cited work mentions a dataset, I will include the full citation for that work as it pertains to the dataset.

Since the paper does not provide explicit datasets, I will summarize the findings and note that while specific datasets were not mentioned, the authors reference several foundational works that may involve datasets relevant to adversarial robustness research.

Finally, I will ensure that I have documented all relevant citations accurately, as this is crucial for any downstream processing or review of the datasets mentioned in the context of the paper.
