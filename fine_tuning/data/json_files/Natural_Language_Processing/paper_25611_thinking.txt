To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SLOWFAST-LLAVA: A STRONG TRAINING-FREE BASELINE FOR VIDEO LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS" by Mingze Xu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to look for any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the proposed model is evaluated on various video tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In **subsection 4.1 (Benchmarks and Metrics)**, the authors list several benchmarks for their experiments, specifically mentioning:

1. **MSVD-QA**: A dataset for open-ended video question answering.
2. **MSRVTT-QA**: Another dataset for open-ended video question answering.
3. **TGIF-QA**: A dataset focused on video question answering.
4. **ActivityNet-QA**: A dataset for understanding complex web videos via question answering.
5. **NExTQA**: A dataset for multiple choice video question answering.
6. **EgoSchema**: A dataset requiring long-form understanding of egocentric videos.
7. **IntentQA**: A dataset for context-aware video intent reasoning.
8. **VCGBench**: A benchmark for evaluating text generation performance in video LLMs.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, I will look for the following citations:

- **MSVD-QA**: 
  > Chen, D. L., & Dolan, W. B. (2011). Collecting highly parallel data for paraphrase evaluation. In ACL.

- **MSRVTT-QA**: 
  > Xu, Y., et al. (2016). MSR-VTT: A large video description dataset for bridging video and language. In CVPR.

- **TGIF-QA**: 
  > Li, Y., et al. (2016). TGIF: A new dataset and benchmark on animated gif description. In CVPR.

- **ActivityNet-QA**: 
  > Yu, Z., et al. (2019). ActivityNet-QA: A dataset for understanding complex web videos via question answering. In AAAI.

- **NExTQA**: 
  > Xiao, J., et al. (2021). NExT-QA: Next phase of question-answering to explaining temporal actions. In CVPR.

- **EgoSchema**: 
  > Mangalam, K., et al. (2024). Egoschema: A diagnostic benchmark for very long-form video language understanding. NeurIPS.

- **IntentQA**: 
  > Li, K., et al. (2023). IntentQA: Context-aware video intent reasoning. In ICCV.

- **VCGBench**: 
  > Maaz, M., et al. (2024). VCGBench: A benchmark for evaluating video language models. In ACL.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, facilitating further exploration and validation of the findings presented in the paper.
