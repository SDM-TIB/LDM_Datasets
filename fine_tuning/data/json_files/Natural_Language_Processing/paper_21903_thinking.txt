To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SEED-Bench-2-Plus: Benchmarking Multimodal Large Language Models with Text-Rich Visual Comprehension" by Bohao Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the paper introduces a benchmark called **SEED-Bench-2-Plus**, which includes multiple-choice questions across various categories. This suggests that there may be datasets associated with these questions.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section** where the authors describe the construction of the benchmark. They mention that the benchmark comprises **2.3K multiple-choice questions** categorized into **Charts, Maps, and Webs**. This indicates that there are datasets related to these categories.

In the **data source section**, the authors detail how they gathered data for each category:

1. **Charts**: The authors manually collected **20 types of charts** from the internet, including Fishbone Diagrams, Flow Charts, and Gantt Charts. They utilized GPT-4V to generate questions based on these charts.

2. **Maps**: They gathered **25 types of maps**, such as Astronomical Maps and Political Maps, also using GPT-4V for question generation.

3. **Webs**: The authors collected **18 types of website screenshots** from various platforms, including Airbnb and GitHub, again employing GPT-4V for question generation.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. However, since the datasets are primarily constructed from publicly available resources and the authors have not cited specific papers for each dataset type, I will note that the datasets are derived from common types of visual data rather than specific publications.

The relevant citations for the benchmark itself are:
- Bohao Li, Yuying Ge, Yi Chen, Yixiao Ge, Ruimao Zhang, and Ying Shan. *SEED-Bench-2-Plus: Benchmarking Multimodal Large Language Models with Text-Rich Visual Comprehension*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2311.17092, 2023.

In summary, I will compile the dataset information as follows:

1. **SEED-Bench-2-Plus Dataset**: A benchmark dataset containing 2.3K multiple-choice questions categorized into Charts, Maps, and Webs, generated from various types of visual data.

Now, I will prepare the dataset entries for further processing.
