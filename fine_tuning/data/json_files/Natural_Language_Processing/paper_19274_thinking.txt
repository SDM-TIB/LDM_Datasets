To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Bayesian Active Learning for Censored Regression" by Frederik Boe HÃ¼ttel et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of the proposed method across a wide range of datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **experiments**. In this paper, there is a section titled **5 (Experiments)**, which provides an overview of the datasets used in the analysis. I will carefully read through this section to extract the names and descriptions of the datasets.

In **Table 1**, the authors summarize various datasets used in their experiments, including:

1. **Synthetic Dataset**: A generated dataset based on a sine function with specific censoring characteristics.
2. **BreastMSK**: A dataset for predicting survival time for breast cancer patients.
3. **METABRIC**: Another breast cancer dataset focusing on clinical and gene expression features.
4. **WHAS**: A dataset for predicting survival time after myocardial infarction.
5. **GBSG**: A dataset for breast cancer survival prediction.
6. **SUPPORT**: A dataset for predicting survival time in seriously ill hospitalized patients.
7. **Churn**: A dataset for predicting customer churn.
8. **Credit Risk**: A dataset for predicting loan repayment times.
9. **SurvMNIST**: A modified version of the MNIST dataset for survival analysis.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The authors often cite the original sources of the datasets, which is crucial for proper attribution. 

For example, I will find the following citations:

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will allow for a comprehensive understanding of the datasets used in the research and their relevance to the study's findings.
