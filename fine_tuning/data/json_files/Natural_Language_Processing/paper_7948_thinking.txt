To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Pre-trained Speech Representations as Feature Extractors for Speech Quality Assessment in Online Conferencing Applications" by Bastiaan Tamm et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract provides a general overview of the study but does not specify datasets. The introduction discusses the importance of automated speech quality assessment but does not name any datasets either.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Methods)**, specifically **subsection 2.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used in their study. Here, they mention that the dataset provided in the ConferencingSpeech 2022 challenge comprises four corpora, which is a clear indication that multiple datasets are involved.

The four datasets mentioned are:

1. **Tencent Corpus**: This dataset consists of around 14,000 Chinese speech clips from 1,089 speakers, with clips ranging from 5 to 13.5 seconds in length.

2. **Non-intrusive Speech Quality Assessment (NISQA) Corpus**: This is a publicly available collection of over 14,000 English and German speech clips, which includes both real and simulated noise.

3. **Indiana University (IU) Bloomington Corpus**: This corpus contains 36,000 English speech samples derived from the VOiCES and COSINE datasets, with speech clips ranging from three to six seconds long.

4. **Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) Corpus**: This dataset consists of approximately 80,000 English speech samples based on LibriVox, with each sample lasting 10 seconds and containing both clean and noise-affected samples.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The relevant citations are:

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented and properly cited for future reference.
