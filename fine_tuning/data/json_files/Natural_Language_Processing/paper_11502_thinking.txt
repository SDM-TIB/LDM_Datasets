To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Simple Data Augmentation for Feature Distribution Skewed Federated Learning" by Yunlu Yan and Lei Zhu, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that extensive experiments were conducted on several datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed present.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of federated learning and mention that they conducted experiments on "two classification datasets and an MRI segmentation dataset." This gives me a hint that there are at least three datasets to look for.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4), where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. They mention:

1. **Office-Caltech-10**: This dataset is used for image classification tasks. It consists of images from two datasets: Office and Caltech-101, which are commonly used for domain adaptation tasks.

2. **DomainNet**: Another dataset for image classification, which is a large-scale dataset for domain adaptation that includes images from various categories.

3. **ProstateMRI**: This dataset is used for medical image segmentation tasks, specifically for prostate segmentation in MRI scans.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Office-Caltech-10**, the citation is:
  > Gong, B., Shi, Y., Sha, F., & Grauman, K. (2012). Geodesic flow kernel for unsupervised domain adaptation. In 2012 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (pp. 2066-2073). IEEE.

- For **DomainNet**, the citation is:
  > Peng, X., Bai, Q., Xia, X., Huang, Z., Saenko, K., & Wang, B. (2019). Moment matching for multi-source domain adaptation. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (pp. 1406-1415).

- For **ProstateMRI**, the citation is:
  > Liu, Q., Dou, Q., Yu, L., & Heng, P.A. (2020). Ms-net: Multi-site network for improving prostate segmentation with heterogeneous MRI data. IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging, 39(9), 2713-2724.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and that the full citations are included for reference. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details regarding the datasets used in the research.
