To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Vector Quantized Approach for Text to Speech Synthesis on Real-World Spontaneous Speech" by Li-Wei Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors utilize real-world speech from YouTube and podcasts, which suggests that these sources may be part of a dataset.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention:

1. **GigaSpeech**: This dataset is described as an ASR corpus containing transcribed audio from audiobooks, podcasts, and YouTube, with a total of 896 hours for training and 2.4 hours for validation. The authors also mention a data-cleaning pipeline applied to this dataset.

2. **VoxCeleb**: The authors use the test set of VoxCeleb to select 40 utterances from different speakers for human evaluation. This dataset is noted for its speaker diversity and is used to ensure varied speaker references in their evaluations.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **GigaSpeech**, the citation is:
  > Chen, G., Chai, S., Wang, G., Du, J., Zhang, W.-Q., Weng, C., Su, D., Povey, D., Trmal, J., Zhang, J., Jin, M., Khudanpur, S., Watanabe, S., Zhao, S., Zou, W., Li, X., Yao, X., Wang, Y., Wang, Y., You, Z., and Yan, Z. (2021). GigaSpeech: An Evolving, Multi-domain ASR Corpus with 10,000 Hours of Transcribed Audio. In Proc. Interspeech 2021.

- For **VoxCeleb**, the citation is:
  > Nagrani, A., Chung, J. S., Xie, W., and Zisserman, A. (2019). Voxceleb: Large-scale speaker verification in the wild. Computer Science and Language.

Now that I have the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations.
