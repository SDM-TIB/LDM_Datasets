To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Global air quality inequality over 2000-2020" by Lutz Sager, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the study's focus and any datasets that may be referenced. The abstract mentions the use of "gridded population data" and "annual concentration estimates of fine particles with 2.5 microns or less in diameter (PM2.5)," indicating that these are key datasets.

Next, I will look for specific sections that discuss the datasets in detail, particularly the **Methods** section, where the author describes the data sources and methodologies used. Here, I find that the paper combines two main datasets:

1. **Gridded Population of the World (GPW v4.11)**: This dataset provides population count data adjusted to match UN WPP country totals, with a resolution of 30 arc-seconds. It is crucial for understanding population exposure to PM2.5.

2. **PM2.5 Concentration Estimates**: The paper references a dataset that provides monthly global estimates of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentrations, which is essential for analyzing air quality.

In the **Methods** section, the author specifies the sources for these datasets:

- For the **Gridded Population of the World (GPW v4.11)**, the citation is:
  > CIESIN. Gridded Population of the World, Version 4 (GPWv4): Population Count Adjusted to Match 2015 Revision of UN WPP Country Totals Revision 11 (NASA Socioeconomic Data and Applications Center (SEDAC), 2018). Data accessed on 9 March 2023.

- For the **PM2.5 concentration estimates**, the citation is:
  > Van Donkelaar, A. et al. Monthly global estimates of fine particulate matter and their uncertainty. Environmental Science & Technology 55, 15287â€“15300 (2021). Data accessed on 7 March 2023.

After identifying these datasets, I will ensure to note their significance in the context of the research findings, particularly how they contribute to measuring global air quality inequality.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as they are critical for proper attribution and further research.

This structured approach will help me accurately extract and document the datasets used in the paper, ensuring that I maintain the integrity of the research and provide clear references for future use.
