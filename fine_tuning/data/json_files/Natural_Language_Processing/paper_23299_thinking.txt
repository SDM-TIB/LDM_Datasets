To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Visual-RolePlay: Universal Jailbreak Attack on MultiModal Large Language Models via Role-playing Image Character" by Siyuan Ma et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of "widely used jailbreak attack datasets," which indicates that datasets are indeed present in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, they explicitly mention two datasets:

1. **RedTeam-2k**: This dataset consists of 2000 diverse and high-quality harmful textual questions across 16 harmful categories. The authors state that they randomly split this dataset into training, validation, and test sets with a ratio of 6:2:2.

2. **HarmBench**: This is described as an open-source framework for automated red teaming, containing 320 textual harmful questions in its test set.

To ensure I have the correct citations, I will check the **References section** of the paper for the full citations of these datasets:

- For **RedTeam-2k**, the citation is:
  > Luo, W., Ma, S., Liu, X., Guo, X., & Xiao, C. (2024). JailbreakV-28K: A benchmark for assessing the robustness of multimodal large language models against jailbreak attacks. arXiv preprint arXiv:2401.12915.

- For **HarmBench**, the citation is:
  > Mazeika, M., Phan, L., Yin, X., Zou, A., Wang, Z., Mu, N., Sakhaee, E., Li, N., Basart, S., Li, B., Forsyth, D., & Hendrycks, D. (2024). Harmbench: A standardized evaluation framework for automated red teaming and robust refusal. arXiv preprint arXiv:2401.12915.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations.
