To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The Impact of Imperfect XAI on Human-AI Decision-Making" by Katelyn Morrison et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the research, which may include references to specific datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will examine the **methodology section** (Section 4), as it typically contains detailed information about the datasets used in the study. In this section, the authors describe the bird species identification task and mention the **CUB-200-2011 dataset**, which is a key dataset for their experiments. I will note the specifics provided about this dataset, including its size and the nature of the data it contains.

The paper states that the CUB-200-2011 dataset consists of 11,788 images of 200 different bird species, which is crucial information for understanding the dataset's scope and application in the study.

Additionally, I will look for any other datasets mentioned in the **results** or **discussion sections**. However, the primary dataset appears to be the CUB-200-2011 dataset, as it is central to the experiments conducted.

After identifying the dataset, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citation for the CUB-200-2011 dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:
> Wah, C., Branson, S., Welinder, P., Perona, P., & Belongie, S. (2011). *Caltech-UCSD Birds-200-2011 (CUB-200-2011)*. Technical Report CNS-TR-2011-001. California Institute of Technology. Retrieved from https://www.vision.caltech.edu/datasets/cub_200_2011/

Now that I have the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring to include the dataset name, description, and full citation as required.

In summary, the steps I took to extract the dataset from the paper are as follows:
1. Read the abstract and introduction for context.
2. Review the methodology section for detailed dataset information.
3. Identify the primary dataset (CUB-200-2011) and its characteristics.
4. Locate the full citation in the references section.

This structured approach ensures that I accurately capture the relevant dataset information from the research paper.
