To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MultiVENT: Multilingual Videos of Events with Aligned Natural Text" by Kate Sanders et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and dataset sections** of the paper. The abstract introduces MultiVENT as a dataset of multilingual, event-centric videos, which indicates that there is a dataset to extract. 

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of existing news video datasets and emphasize the need for a dataset that includes multilingual content. They mention that MultiVENT consists of 2,396 videos covering 260 current events, which provides a clear overview of the dataset's scope.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Dataset)**, where the authors detail the collection process for MultiVENT. They describe the dataset's contents, including the number of videos, the languages covered (Arabic, Chinese, English, Korean, and Russian), and the grounding text documents associated with each video. This section is crucial as it provides specific details about the dataset.

The authors also mention that MultiVENT is used for video retrieval and information acquisition, which reinforces its significance in the field. 

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. In this case, the primary dataset is MultiVENT itself, and the authors do not cite other datasets explicitly used in their work. However, they reference various related datasets in the context of video retrieval and analysis.

Since MultiVENT is the main dataset discussed, I will compile the following citation for it:

- **MultiVENT Dataset**:
  > Kate Sanders, David Etter, Reno Kriz, and Benjamin Van Durme. *MultiVENT: Multilingual Videos of Events with Aligned Natural Text*. Preprint. Under review.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the dataset's key attributes, including its purpose, the number of videos, the languages included, and its applications in video retrieval.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry in a structured format, ensuring that it is ready for review or further processing.
