To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Not All Weights Are Created Equal: Enhancing Energy Efficiency in On-Device Streaming Speech Recognition" by Yang Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on energy efficiency in speech recognition models, but I need to look for specific dataset names.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experimental Results)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they state that they experimented with two datasets: **LibriSpeech** and **Public Video**. I will take note of the details provided about each dataset.

In **Appendix B**, the authors provide further details about these datasets:

1. **LibriSpeech**: This dataset is sourced from audiobooks and comprises 960 hours of training data. It includes two evaluation sets:
   - **Test-Clean**: High-quality recordings that are easy to transcribe.
   - **Test-Others**: Recordings that are more challenging due to factors like accents and background noise.

2. **Public Video**: This is an in-house dataset consisting of audio extracted from publicly available English videos, totaling 148.9K hours of training data. It includes two evaluation sets:
   - **Dictation**: Contains 5.8K hours of unscripted conversations.
   - **Messaging**: Comprises 13.4K hours of audio messages.

Now, I will look for the full citations for these datasets in the **References section** of the paper:

- For **LibriSpeech**, the citation is:
  > Vassil Panayotov, Guoguo Chen, Daniel Povey, and Sanjeev Khudanpur. *Librispeech: An ASR Corpus based on Public Domain Audio Books*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP), 2015.

- For **Public Video**, since it is an in-house dataset, it may not have a formal citation like LibriSpeech. However, I will note that it is derived from publicly available videos with proper ethical considerations.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
