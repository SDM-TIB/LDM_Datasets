To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Self-Enhancement Improves Text-Image Retrieval in Foundation Visual-Language Models" by Yuguang Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses a self-enhancement framework and mentions improvements in cross-modal image retrieval, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they specifically mention two datasets:

1. **PA100k Dataset**: This dataset is used for pedestrian attribute recognition and includes images annotated with various attributes related to sex, dress, and walking position.

2. **BIT-Vehicle Dataset**: This dataset contains images of vehicles annotated with attributes such as color, type, and brand.

In this section, the authors provide details about the datasets, including their unique attributes and the context in which they are used. This confirms that these datasets are integral to their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **PA100k Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Pengze Liu, Xihui Liu, Junjie Yan, and Jing Shao. *Localization guided learning for pedestrian attribute recognition*. In British Machine Vision Conference 2018, page 142. BMVA Press, 2018.

- For the **BIT-Vehicle Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Jun Sang, Zhongyuan Wu, Pei Lin Guo, and et al. *An improved yolov2 for vehicle detection*. Sensors, 18, 2018.

With these citations, I have gathered all necessary information regarding the datasets used in the paper. I will now compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation, ready for structured output.
