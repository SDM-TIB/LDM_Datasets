To extract datasets from the research paper titled "RHOBIN Challenge: Reconstruction of Human Object Interaction" by Xianghui Xie et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are referenced. The abstract mentions the "BEHAVE dataset" as the benchmark dataset used for evaluation, which is a clear indication that this dataset is significant for the research.

Next, I will look into **section 2.1 (Dataset)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the BEHAVE dataset. They explain that it captures humans interacting with objects in natural environments using RGBD cameras, and it includes paired RGB images with 3D ground truth human and object registrations. This section confirms that the BEHAVE dataset is the primary dataset used in their challenge.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the BEHAVE dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:
> Bharat Lal Bhatnagar, Xianghui Xie, Ilya Petrov, Cristian Sminchisescu, Christian Theobalt, and Gerard Pons-Moll. *Behave: Dataset and method for tracking human object interactions*. In IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2022.

Since the paper primarily focuses on the BEHAVE dataset, I will ensure to include this dataset in my final output.

Now, I will summarize the findings:
1. **Dataset Name**: BEHAVE
   - **Description**: A dataset capturing humans interacting with objects in natural environments using RGBD cameras, providing RGB images paired with 3D ground truth human and object registrations.
   - **Full Citation**: Bharat Lal Bhatnagar, Xianghui Xie, Ilya Petrov, Cristian Sminchisescu, Christian Theobalt, and Gerard Pons-Moll. *Behave: Dataset and method for tracking human object interactions*. In IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2022.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that can be used for further processing or review.
