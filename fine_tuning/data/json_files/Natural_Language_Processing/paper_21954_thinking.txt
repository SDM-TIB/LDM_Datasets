To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Spatial-frequency Dual-Domain Feature Fusion Network for Low-Light Remote Sensing Image Enhancement" by Zishu Yao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract states that the authors constructed two dark light remote sensing datasets to address the lack of datasets in this area. This indicates that there are specific datasets that I need to find.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any relevant sections that discuss the datasets in detail. In this paper, the authors mention two datasets: **iSAID-dark** and **darkrs**. I will note down the descriptions provided for each dataset.

In the **dataset section**, the authors describe the **iSAID-dark dataset** as a paired dataset generated from the iSAID dataset, which includes 751 high-resolution aerial images. They mention that they created 3755 training image pairs and 66 validation image pairs. The **darkrs dataset** is described as a real dataset captured by UAVs at night, consisting of 86 test images.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The iSAID dataset is cited as follows:
- **iSAID Dataset**: 
  > S. Waqas Zamir et al., "isaid: A large-scale dataset for instance segmentation in aerial images," in Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops, 2019, pp. 28–37.

The authors do not provide a specific citation for the **darkrs dataset**, as it is a new dataset introduced in this paper. Therefore, I will note that it is a newly constructed dataset without an external citation.

After gathering all this information, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **iSAID-dark Dataset**: A paired dataset created from the iSAID dataset, consisting of 3755 training image pairs and 66 validation image pairs.
   - Citation: S. Waqas Zamir et al., "isaid: A large-scale dataset for instance segmentation in aerial images," in Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops, 2019, pp. 28–37.

2. **darkrs Dataset**: A real dataset captured by UAVs at night, comprising 86 test images. This dataset is newly constructed and does not have an external citation.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited.
