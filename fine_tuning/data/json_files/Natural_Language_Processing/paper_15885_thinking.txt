To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Augmenting Ad-Hoc IR Dataset for Interactive Conversational Search" by Pierre Erbacher et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the datasets discussed. The abstract mentions two datasets: **Qulac** and **ClariQ**, which are essential for evaluating conversational search systems. This indicates that these datasets are likely to be detailed further in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **Datasets** section or any relevant sections that discuss the datasets in detail. In this paper, the authors describe the limitations of existing datasets and emphasize the need for larger datasets for conversational IR. They specifically mention **MsMarco** as the dataset they augment with simulated interactions.

In the **experiments** or **methodology** sections, I will find detailed descriptions of how the authors utilize these datasets. They mention using **MsMarco** for their experiments, which is a significant dataset in the context of information retrieval.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper:

1. **Qulac Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Aliannejadi, M., Kiseleva, J., Chuklin, A., Dalton, J., & Burtsev, M. (2021). Building and Evaluating Open-Domain Dialogue Corpora with Clarifying Questions. In EMNLP.

2. **ClariQ Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Sekulić, I., Aliannejadi, M., & Crestani, F. (2021). Towards Facet-Driven Generation of Clarifying Questions for Conversational Search. In Proceedings of the 2021 ACM SIGIR International Conference on Theory of Information Retrieval (ICTIR ’21). Association for Computing Machinery.

3. **MsMarco Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Nguyen, T., Rosenberg, M., Song, X., Gao, J., Tiwary, S., Majumder, R., & Deng, L. (2016). MS MARCO: A Human Generated MAchine Reading COmprehension Dataset. CoRR abs/1611.09268.

After compiling this information, I will ensure that I have accurately documented the datasets and their citations, ready for any further processing or output formatting.
