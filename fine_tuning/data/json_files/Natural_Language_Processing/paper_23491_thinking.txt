To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Disentangling Logic: The Role of Context in Large Language Model Reasoning Capabilities" by Wenyue Hua et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's goals and may hint at the datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly the **Benchmark Construction** section, where the authors describe how they created their datasets. Here, they mention constructing instantiated datasets for deductive and abductive reasoning with varying levels of difficulty across 12 distinct categories based on Wikipedia's categorization. This indicates that there are multiple datasets involved.

In the **Data Statistics subsection**, the authors provide specific details about the number of data points generated for each reasoning task and the total number of data points across all levels and domains. This information is crucial for understanding the scale of the datasets.

I will also check the **Appendix** for any additional examples or clarifications regarding the datasets. The examples provided in the appendix will help me understand the structure and content of the datasets.

Now, I will compile the full citations for the datasets mentioned in the paper. The authors reference the DyVal framework for generating formal logic templates, which is essential for understanding the dataset's origin. The citation for DyVal is:

- **DyVal**: 
  > Kaijie Zhu, Jiaao Chen, Jindong Wang, Neil Zhenqiang Gong, Diyi Yang, and Xing Xie. *Dyval: Graph-informed dynamic evaluation of large language models*. International Conference on Learning Representations, 2024.

Additionally, the paper mentions the use of Wikipedia categories for contextualization, which serves as a basis for the domains in which the datasets are instantiated. While Wikipedia itself is not a dataset in the traditional sense, it is a critical resource for the dataset's construction.

Finally, I will summarize the datasets identified, including their purpose and the context in which they were used, ensuring to include the full citations for any referenced works.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare a structured output that clearly presents the datasets and their citations for further review or processing.
