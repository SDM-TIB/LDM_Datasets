To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Dual-Domain Multi-Contrast MRI Reconstruction with Synthesis-based Fusion Network" by Junwei Yang and Pietro Li`o, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments using a dataset of brain MRI scans, which suggests that a specific dataset is involved.

Next, I will focus on the **Methods section**, particularly the subsection titled **2.3.1 Dataset**. Here, the authors explicitly mention utilizing a dataset from the **MICCAI Multi-modal Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) challenge 2019**. They describe the dataset as consisting of a large-scale collection of brain MRI data, specifically noting that it includes 335 preprocessed volumes for each contrast (T1w, T2w, and FLAIR).

In this section, the authors provide details about how the dataset was processed, including the extraction of axial slices and the application of random rigid transformations to simulate inter-scan motion. This information is crucial for understanding the dataset's context and usage.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the BraTS dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Menze Bjoern H, Jakab Andras, Bauer Stefan, et al. *The multimodal brain tumor image segmentation benchmark (BRATS)*. IEEE transactions on medical imaging. 2014;34(10):1993â€“2024.

Since this is the only dataset mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that the full citation is included.

Finally, I will summarize the dataset entry, ensuring that it is clear and concise, ready for any further processing or review.
