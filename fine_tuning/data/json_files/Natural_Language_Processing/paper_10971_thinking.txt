To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Replicability in Reinforcement Learning" by Amin Karbasi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a high-level overview, and the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the datasets used in the research.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments or results section** of the paper, as this is where datasets are typically detailed. I will look for any tables, figures, or text that describe the datasets used for experiments, including their names, sizes, and any specific characteristics that are relevant to the study.

If the paper includes a **dedicated section on datasets**, I will carefully extract the information provided there. This section may contain detailed descriptions of each dataset, including the number of samples, types of data, and any preprocessing steps taken.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial, as proper attribution is necessary for academic integrity. I will ensure to note the authors, title, publication venue, and year for each dataset.

For example, if I find that the paper uses the "OpenAI Gym" dataset, I will look up its citation, which might be something like:
> Greg Brockman, Vicki Cheung, Ludwig Pettersson, Jonas Schneider, John Schulman, and Ilya Sutskever. *OpenAI Gym*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01540, 2016.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile it into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited.

Finally, I will review my findings to ensure that I have accurately captured all relevant datasets and their citations, ready for any further processing or analysis.
