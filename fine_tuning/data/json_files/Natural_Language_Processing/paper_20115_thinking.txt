To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DiaLoc: An Iterative Approach to Embodied Dialog Localization" by Chao Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and related work sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention key datasets used for evaluation. The introduction often elaborates on the problem being addressed and may reference specific datasets that are foundational to the research.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly any subsections that discuss datasets. In this paper, the authors mention the **WAY dataset**, which is crucial for evaluating their proposed method. I will look for detailed descriptions of this dataset, including its size, structure, and any specific characteristics that are relevant to the research.

In the **experiments section**, the authors specify that the WAY dataset contains approximately 10,000 dialogs curated by human operators, and they detail how the dataset is split into training, validation, and test sets. This information is essential for understanding how the dataset is utilized in their experiments.

After gathering the necessary details about the dataset, I will consult the **references section** to find the full citation for the WAY dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:

- For the **WAY dataset**, the citation is:
  > Meera Hahn, Jacob Krantz, Dhruv Batra, Devi Parikh, James M. Rehg, Stefan Lee, and Peter Anderson. *Where are you? Localization from Embodied Dialog*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2011.08277, 2020.

This citation is important as it provides the original source of the dataset, which is crucial for proper attribution.

Finally, I will compile the extracted dataset information, including its description and citation, ensuring that it is formatted correctly for any downstream processing or review.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets referenced in the paper, maintaining a focus on clarity and completeness.
