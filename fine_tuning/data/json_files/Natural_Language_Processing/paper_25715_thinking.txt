To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Raindrop Clarity: A Dual-Focused Dataset for Day and Night Raindrop Removal" by Yeying Jin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant details, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract introduces the Raindrop Clarity dataset, which is a significant focus of the paper. It mentions that this dataset consists of 15,186 high-quality image pairs and triplets, specifically designed for raindrop removal tasks. This indicates that the dataset is central to the research.

Next, I will examine **section 3 (Raindrop Clarity Dataset)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset. Here, they describe the dataset's composition, which includes:

1. **Pairs of images**: These consist of raindrop-focused images and their corresponding clear background images.
2. **Triplets of images**: These include raindrop-focused images, corresponding blurry raindrop-free background images, and their clear background equivalents.

The dataset is further categorized into daytime and nighttime images, with specific counts provided:
- 5,442 daytime raindrop images
- 9,744 nighttime raindrop images
- A total of 15,186 images, including both pairs and triplets.

The authors also highlight the unique aspects of the dataset, such as its focus on both raindrop-focused and background-focused images, as well as its collection under various lighting conditions.

Now, I will look into the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned in the paper. The authors reference several existing datasets in the related work section, but the primary dataset they introduce is the Raindrop Clarity dataset itself. Since this dataset is newly proposed, it does not have an external citation but will be cited as follows:

- **Raindrop Clarity Dataset**: 
  > Yeying Jin, Xin Li, Jiadong Wang, Yan Zhang, and Malu Zhang. *Raindrop Clarity: A Dual-Focused Dataset for Day and Night Raindrop Removal*. In Proceedings of the [Conference Name], [Year].

Since the paper does not provide a specific conference name or year in the text, I will note that this information should be filled in based on the publication details.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the Raindrop Clarity dataset as it is the primary focus of the research. This will allow for easy reference and acknowledgment in future works.
