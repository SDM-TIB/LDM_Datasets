To extract datasets from the research paper titled "High Dynamic Range Imaging of Dynamic Scenes with Saturation Compensation" by Haesoo Chung and Nam Ik Cho, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the use of multi-exposure images for HDR imaging, which suggests that there may be datasets involved. The introduction further discusses the challenges of HDR imaging and references existing methods, hinting at the use of specific datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors explicitly state that they use a dataset constructed by Kalantari et al. [18] for both training and testing. This is a crucial piece of information, as it identifies the dataset used in their experiments.

I will then check the **experiments section** to gather more details about the dataset. The authors mention that the dataset consists of 74 scenes for training and 15 scenes for testing, each containing three dynamic LDR images with different exposures. This provides a clear description of the dataset's structure and purpose.

After identifying the dataset, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset mentioned. The citation for the dataset constructed by Kalantari et al. is as follows:

- For the dataset by Kalantari et al.:
  > Nima Khademi Kalantari and Ravi Ramamoorthi. *Deep high dynamic range imaging of dynamic scenes*. ACM Transactions on Graphics (TOG), 36(4):144â€“1, 2017.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the findings:

1. **Dataset Name**: Kalantari et al. dataset
   - **Description**: This dataset consists of 74 scenes for training and 15 scenes for testing, each containing three dynamic LDR images with different exposures.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference and ensure that the full citation is included for proper attribution. This process ensures that I have accurately extracted and documented the datasets used in the research paper.
