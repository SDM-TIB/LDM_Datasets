To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Nichtlineares Zweispurmodell eines LKW-Sattelaufliegers mit experimenteller Validierung der lateralen und vertikalen Reifenkr√§fte" by Simon F. G. Ehlers et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental validation sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any mention of data collection or specific datasets used for validation.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any statements regarding the datasets or measurements taken during the experiments. The introduction often outlines the context and significance of the research, which may include references to specific datasets or sources of data.

In the **methodology section**, I will focus on the details of the experimental setup and data collection methods. The authors describe the use of strain gauges to measure lateral and vertical tire forces, which indicates that there are specific datasets generated from these measurements. I will note the types of data collected, such as tire forces and vehicle dynamics.

The **experimental validation section** is crucial as it typically contains detailed descriptions of the experiments conducted, including the specific datasets used for validation. I will look for any tables or figures that summarize the data collected during the experiments, as well as any references to external datasets that may have been used for comparison.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. This is important for proper attribution and to provide context for the datasets used in the research.

Based on the information gathered, I will compile the datasets into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and accompanied by its full citation. This will include details such as the type of data, the context in which it was collected, and any relevant parameters.

Finally, I will ensure that the dataset entries are complete and ready for further processing or review, maintaining a focus on clarity and accuracy in the documentation of each dataset.
