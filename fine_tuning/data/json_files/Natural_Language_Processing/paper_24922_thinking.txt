To extract datasets from the research paper titled "LLaMAX: Scaling Linguistic Horizons of LLM by Enhancing Translation Capabilities Beyond 100 Languages" by Yinquan Lu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions extensive multilingual continual pre-training and references the **Flores-101 benchmark**, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will look for specific sections that detail the datasets used. In the **Training Data Construction section**, the authors describe the components of their training data, which includes:

1. **MC4 Dataset**: A multilingual variant of the C4 dataset, comprising natural text in 101 languages sourced from Common Crawl. This dataset is crucial for training massively multilingual models.

2. **MADLAD-400 Dataset**: A manually audited general domain monolingual dataset based on CommonCrawl, covering 419 languages. This dataset is notable for its extensive language coverage and rigorous auditing process.

3. **Lego-MT Dataset**: A benchmark for massively multilingual machine translation, featuring a detachable model built upon an efficient training recipe. It includes a comprehensive translation benchmark with data from OPUS, covering 433 languages.

In the **Evaluation Benchmark section**, the authors mention additional datasets used for evaluation:

1. **Flores-101**: A benchmark for machine translation evaluation, comprising a multi-way dataset derived from English Wikipedia and produced by professional translators.

2. **Flores-200**: An extension of the Flores-101 dataset, containing parallel sentences for 200 languages.

3. **WMT-23**: A comprehensive translation evaluation benchmark proposed in 2023.

4. **TICO**: A dataset representing a joint translation effort targeting COVID-19 materials.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the references section:
