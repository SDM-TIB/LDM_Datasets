To extract datasets from the research paper titled "TAMIL-LLAMA: A NEW TAMIL LANGUAGE MODEL BASED ON LLAMA 2" by Abhinand Balachandran, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors introduce a Tamil-translated version of the Alpaca dataset and a subset of the OpenOrca dataset, which suggests that these are key datasets used in their research.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Tamil LLaMA)**, particularly **subsections 3.1.1 (Datasets used for Pre-Training)** and **3.1.2 (Datasets used for Instruction Tuning)**. Here, the authors detail the datasets utilized during different phases of their model training:

1. **CulturaX Dataset**: This dataset is mentioned as the primary source for pre-training, comprising a combination of various datasets, including the Oscar dataset. The authors selected 600k documents from CulturaX for training.

2. **Alpaca Dataset**: The authors provide a Tamil-translated version of the original Alpaca dataset, which consists of 52,000 instructions used for instruction tuning.

3. **OpenOrca Dataset**: A specialized no-code section from the OpenOrca dataset is also integrated, containing around 93,000 instructions tailored for instruction fine-tuning.

In the **References section**, I will look for full citations for these datasets:

- For the **CulturaX Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Nguyen, T., et al. *CulturaX: A cleaned, enormous, and multilingual dataset for large language models in 167 languages*. 2023.

- For the **Alpaca Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Taori, R., et al. *Stanford Alpaca: An instruction-following LLaMA model*. 2023. Available at: https://github.com/tatsu-lab/stanford_alpaca.

- For the **OpenOrca Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Lian, W., et al. *OpenOrca: An open dataset of GPT augmented Flan reasoning traces*. 2023. Available at: https://huggingface.co/Open-Orca/OpenOrca.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations for future use or analysis.
