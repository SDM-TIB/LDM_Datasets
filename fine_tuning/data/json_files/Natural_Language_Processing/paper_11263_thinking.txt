To extract datasets from the research paper titled "StreetSurf: Extending Multi-view Implicit Surface Reconstruction to Street Views" by Jianfei Guo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the method is applicable to "widely-used autonomous driving datasets," which suggests that specific datasets will be referenced later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors mention several autonomous driving datasets, specifically **KITTI**, **Waymo Open Dataset**, and **NuScenes**. This is a strong indication that these datasets are integral to the research and will likely be described in detail later.

In the **experiments section**, I will look for a dedicated subsection that discusses the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention that they conducted experiments on the **Waymo Open Dataset** and provide specific sequence identifiers (e.g., seg1006130, seg1347637). This confirms that the Waymo Open Dataset is a primary dataset used in their experiments.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The citations for the datasets are crucial for proper attribution and should be formatted correctly.

For the **Waymo Open Dataset**, the citation is:
> Sun, P., Kretzschmar, H., Dotiwalla, A., Chouard, A., Patnaik, V., Tsui, P., Guo, J., Zhou, Y., Chai, Y., Caine, B., et al. "Scalability in perception for autonomous driving: Waymo open dataset." In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 2446–2454, 2020.

For the **KITTI dataset**, the citation is:
> Geiger, A., Lenz, P., and Urtasun, R. "Are we ready for autonomous driving? The KITTI vision benchmark suite." In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 3354–3361, 2012.

For the **NuScenes dataset**, the citation is:
> Caesar, H., Bankiti, V., Lang, A. H., Vora, S., Liong, V. E., Xu, Q., Krishnan, A., Pan, Y., Baldan, G., and Beijbom, O. "NuScenes: A multimodal dataset for autonomous driving." In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 11621–11631, 2020.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
