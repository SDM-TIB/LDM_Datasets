To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Revisiting Scalable Hessian Diagonal Approximations for Applications in Reinforcement Learning" by Mohamed Elsayed et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for experiments. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets in relation to the research.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **experiments**. In this paper, the authors discuss their methods and applications in reinforcement learning, which may involve specific datasets used for training and evaluation. I will pay close attention to any mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

In the **experiments section**, I will look for detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the experiments. The authors may provide information about the datasets, such as their source, the number of samples, and any relevant preprocessing steps. This information is crucial for understanding how the datasets were utilized in their research.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is important for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. I will ensure that I capture the authors, title, publication venue, and year for each dataset.

For example, if the authors mention using the **CIFAR-100 dataset**, I would look for the citation:
> Krizhevsky, A., & Hinton, G. (2009). Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images. Technical Report, University of Toronto.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, into a structured format for easy reference.

Finally, I will ensure that all extracted information is accurate and properly formatted before concluding the extraction process.
