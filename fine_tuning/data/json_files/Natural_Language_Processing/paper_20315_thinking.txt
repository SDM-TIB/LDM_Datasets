To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Gradient based Feature Attribution in Explainable AI: A Technical Review" by Yongjie Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a high-level overview, but I will need to look deeper into the paper for specific dataset references.

Next, I will examine the **sections that discuss experiments or evaluations**, as these are likely to contain mentions of datasets used for testing the methods described. I will pay particular attention to any tables or figures that might summarize datasets or their characteristics.

In the **evaluation metrics section**, the authors discuss various methods and metrics for assessing the performance of gradient-based explanations. While this section may not explicitly list datasets, it might reference datasets used in previous studies or benchmarks that are relevant to the discussion.

After thoroughly reviewing these sections, I will compile a list of any datasets mentioned, including their names, descriptions, and any relevant details such as the number of samples or specific characteristics.

Once I have identified the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets themselves.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like "CIFAR-10," I will look for its citation in the references, which might look something like this:
> Alex Krizhevsky, Ilya Sutskever, and Geoffrey E. Hinton. *Imagenet classification with deep convolutional neural networks*. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 2012.

I will ensure that I capture the full citation format as required.

Finally, I will summarize the findings in a clear and concise manner, ensuring that each dataset is accompanied by its full citation, ready for any downstream processing or review.

By following these steps, I will ensure a comprehensive extraction of datasets from the paper while maintaining the integrity of the citations.
