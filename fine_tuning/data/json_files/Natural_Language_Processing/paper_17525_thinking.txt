To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Harnessing the Power of Federated Learning in Federated Contextual Bandits" by Chengshuai Shi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for evaluation. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets in relation to the research problem.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their empirical evaluations. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, characteristics, and any relevant details such as the number of samples or specific tasks they are used for.

In this paper, the authors mention two datasets used for their experiments:

1. **Bibtex Dataset**: This dataset is used for multi-label classification tasks. It contains contexts and labels that the agents must learn to predict.

2. **Delicious Dataset**: Similar to the Bibtex dataset, this dataset is also used for multi-label classification and involves a different set of contexts and labels.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for these datasets. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **Bibtex Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Katakis, I., Tsoumakas, G., & Vlahavas, I. (2008). Multilabel text classification for automated tag suggestion. ECML PKDD discovery challenge, 75:2008.

- For the **Delicious Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Tsoumakas, G., Katakis, I., & Vlahavas, I. (2008). Effective and efficient multilabel classification in domains with large number of labels. In Proc. ECML/PKDD 2008 Workshop on Mining Multidimensional Data (MMD’08), volume 21, pp. 53–59.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or analysis.
