To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Moving Target Detection Method Based on Range-Doppler Domain Compensation and Cancellation for UAV Mounted Radar" by Xiaodong Qu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or experimental data.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors often discuss the context of their research and may reference datasets used in previous studies or their own experiments. I will take note of any specific datasets mentioned.

Then, I will examine the **methodology** section, particularly any subsections that detail the experiments conducted. This section typically outlines the datasets used for testing the proposed methods. I will look for specific names of datasets, their characteristics, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

After that, I will check the **results** section, where the authors may present findings based on the datasets. They might provide performance metrics or comparisons that reference the datasets used.

Finally, I will consult the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned in the paper. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for the datasets.

For this paper, I will specifically look for datasets related to UAV-mounted radar experiments, including any simulation data or real-world data collected during the experiments.

Once I have identified the datasets and their details, I will compile the full citations for each dataset, ensuring that I include all necessary information such as authors, title, publication venue, and year.

In summary, my steps will be:
1. Read the abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections for mentions of datasets.
2. Note specific datasets and their characteristics.
3. Check the references for full citations of the datasets.
4. Compile the information into a structured format for further use.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and cite the datasets used in the research paper.
