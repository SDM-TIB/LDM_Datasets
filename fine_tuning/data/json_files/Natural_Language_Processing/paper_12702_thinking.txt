To extract datasets from the research paper titled "HouYi: An open-source large language model specially designed for renewable energy and carbon neutrality field" by Mingliang Bai et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the paper introduces the **Renewable Energy Academic Paper (REAP) dataset**, which is a strong indication that a dataset is present.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Construction of Renewable Energy Academic Paper (REAP) dataset)**, where the authors describe the dataset in detail. Here, they mention that the REAP dataset contains the titles and abstracts of **1,168,970 academic papers** sourced from the Web of Science. This section provides crucial information about the dataset's size and content.

I will also check the **conclusion and acknowledgments** sections to see if there are any additional mentions or clarifications about the dataset. However, the primary details about the REAP dataset are likely to be found in section 2.

Now, I will gather the full citation for the dataset. Since the REAP dataset is introduced as the first open-source dataset for renewable energy research, I will ensure to provide the citation for the paper itself, as it serves as the authoritative source for the dataset.

The citation for the dataset is:
> Bai, M., Zhou, Z., Wang, R., Yang, Y., Qin, Z., Chen, Y., Mu, C., Liu, J., & Yu, D. (2023). HouYi: An open-source large language model specially designed for renewable energy and carbon neutrality field. *[Journal Name]*, *[Volume]*, *[Page Numbers]*. [Link to the paper if available]

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format, ensuring that the full citation is included for the REAP dataset. This will allow for proper referencing and acknowledgment of the dataset in future research or applications.
