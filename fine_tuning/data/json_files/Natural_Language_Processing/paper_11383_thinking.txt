To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Mean-Variance Efficient Collaborative Filtering for Stock Recommendation" by Munki Chung et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or data sources.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the need for stock recommendation systems and may reference datasets that are foundational to their research. I will pay close attention to any specific datasets mentioned.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly **section 5.1 (Data & Models)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention two datasets:

1. **Survivorship-Bias-Free US Mutual Fund data** from the Center for Research in Security Prices (CRSP).
2. **Stock Ownership data** from Thomson Reuters.

Both datasets contain holdings snapshots of users (mutual funds or institutional investors) for every month from 2001 to 2020. This section confirms that these datasets are crucial for their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. Since the datasets are sourced from established databases, I will format the citations accordingly:

- For the **Survivorship-Bias-Free US Mutual Fund data**, the citation is:
  > Center for Research in Security Prices (CRSP). *Survivorship-Bias-Free US Mutual Fund Data*. Retrieved from Wharton Research Data Services (WRDS).

- For the **Stock Ownership data**, the citation is:
  > Thomson Reuters. *Stock Ownership Data*. Retrieved from Wharton Research Data Services (WRDS).

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and includes the full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
