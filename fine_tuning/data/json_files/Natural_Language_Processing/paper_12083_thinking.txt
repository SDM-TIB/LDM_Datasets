To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Social-Mobility-Aware Joint Communication and Computation Resource Management in NOMA-Enabled Vehicular Networks" by Tong Xue et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, but I will need to look deeper into the methodology and results sections for specific datasets.

Next, I will examine **section II (System Model and Problem Formulation)** and **section III (Solution of the EE Optimization Problem)**. These sections often contain details about the simulations and experiments conducted, which may reference specific datasets or benchmarks used for evaluation.

I will also check the **simulation results section** to see if the authors mention any datasets used for their simulations. This is crucial as it often includes performance metrics based on specific datasets.

After identifying potential datasets, I will look at the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is important for proper attribution and to provide context for the datasets used in the research.

If the paper refers to any established datasets, I will ensure to include their original citations. If the authors created their own datasets, I will note the details provided in the paper and cite the paper itself as the source.

For example, if the authors mention using a dataset like "3GPP TR 36.885" for simulation parameters, I will extract the citation as follows:
> 3GPP, “Study on LTE-based V2X services,” in 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP), TR 36.885, 2016.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring clarity and completeness for any downstream processing or review.
