To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "End to end Hindi to English speech conversion using Bark, mBART and a finetuned XLSR Wav2Vec2" by Aniket Tathe et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract mentions a framework that utilizes XLSR Wav2Vec2, mBART, and Bark, but I need to look for specific datasets.

In the **introduction**, the authors reference various ASR models and mention the **Common Voice corpus** as a significant resource for their work. This indicates that the Common Voice dataset is likely relevant to their methodology.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (XLSR Wav2vec2 Fine-tuning)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the **Common Voice corpus**. They describe it as an extensive repository of transcribed speech, highlighting its size and the languages it covers. This section confirms that the Common Voice corpus is indeed a dataset used in their research.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Common Voice corpus. The citation provided in the references is:

- For **Common Voice corpus**:
  > Rosana Ardila et al. "Common Voice: A Massively-Multilingual Speech Corpus." 2020. arXiv: 1912.06670 [cs.CL].

Since this is the only dataset explicitly mentioned in the paper, I will compile this information.

Now, I will summarize the findings for the dataset in a structured manner, ensuring that I include the full citation as required. 

After completing this process, I will have a clear entry for the dataset used in the research paper, ready for any further processing or documentation.
