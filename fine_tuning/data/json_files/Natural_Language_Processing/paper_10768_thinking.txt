To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning across Data Owners with Joint Differential Privacy" by Yangsibo Huang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors empirically study joint differential privacy over two public datasets, which indicates that datasets are involved. I will note this down as a starting point.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (Section 4) where the authors describe their empirical studies. In this section, they explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. I will focus on the following parts:

1. **Section 4.1 (Experimental Setup)**: Here, the authors state that they consider the multi-class classification problem over two public datasets: **MNIST** and **FashionMNIST**. I will extract details about these datasets, including their purpose and any relevant characteristics mentioned.

2. I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access the datasets.

For the **MNIST dataset**, I will find the citation:
- Yann LeCun, Léon Bottou, Yoshua Bengio, and Patrick Haffner. *Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition*. Proceedings of the IEEE, 86(11):2278–2324, 1998.

For the **FashionMNIST dataset**, the citation is:
- Han Xiao, Kashif Rasul, and Roland Vollgraf. *Fashion-mnist: a novel image dataset for benchmarking machine learning algorithms*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1708.07747, 2017.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **MNIST**: A dataset of handwritten digits used for training various image processing systems. It consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images.

2. **FashionMNIST**: A dataset consisting of 70,000 grayscale images of clothing items, intended as a drop-in replacement for the MNIST dataset for benchmarking machine learning algorithms.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accompanied by its full citation, ready for structured output or further processing.
