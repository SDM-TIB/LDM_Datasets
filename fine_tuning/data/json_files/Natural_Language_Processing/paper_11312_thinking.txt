To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Good, but not always Fair: An Evaluation of Gender Bias for three commercial Machine Translation Systems" by Silvia Alma Piazzolla et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the paper evaluates three commercial MT systems, which suggests that there may be datasets used for this evaluation.

Next, I will look for specific sections that typically contain dataset information, such as **methodology, experiments, or results**. In this paper, the authors mention the **MuST-SHE benchmark** in the **Experimental Settings and Methodology** section. This is a strong indication that it is a primary dataset used in their analysis.

In the **Methodology section**, the authors describe the MuST-SHE benchmark in detail, stating that it is a multilingual, gender-sensitive dataset built upon TED talks, containing approximately 1000 segments aligned at the sentence level for English to French, Italian, and Spanish translations. This dataset is crucial for their evaluation of gender bias in MT systems.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the MuST-SHE dataset. The authors reference it as follows:

Next, I will summarize the dataset details:

1. **MuST-SHE Benchmark**: A multilingual, gender-sensitive dataset for evaluating machine translation systems, containing ~1000 segments aligned at the sentence level for English to French, Italian, and Spanish translations.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and that the full citation is included. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
