To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Implication of modelling choices on connectivity estimation: A comparative analysis" by Marie Soret et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, results, and discussion sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's objectives and methods, which may include mentions of datasets used for analysis.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly the subsections that describe the study area, focal species, and observation data. Here, the authors detail the datasets they utilized, including the **observation dataset** of the Common Midwife Toad (Alytes obstetricans) and any relevant environmental data.

In the **study area subsection**, I will look for specific datasets related to the geographical and ecological context of the research. The authors mention using a land-cover map produced by Remon et al. (2022), which is crucial for understanding the landscape characterisation.

In the **focal species and observation data subsection**, I will find that the authors collected **712 occurrence points** of the midwife toad, which were used for species distribution modelling. This dataset is essential for the analysis and should be documented.

Additionally, I will check the **supplementary information** for any additional datasets or details that may not be included in the main text. The supplementary information provides insights into expert opinions on habitat suitability and resistance costs, which are also relevant datasets.

Now, I will compile the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper:

1. **Observation dataset of the Common Midwife Toad (Alytes obstetricans)**:

4. **Species distribution models (SDM)**:

After gathering this information, I will ensure that each dataset is clearly documented with its full citation, ready for further processing or review.
