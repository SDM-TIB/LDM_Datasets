To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Can We Edit Multimodal Large Language Models?" by Siyuan Cheng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the construction of a new benchmark called **MMEdit** for editing multimodal LLMs, which suggests that datasets are involved. The introduction further elaborates on the need for datasets in the context of multimodal model editing.

Next, I will focus on the **Datasets section (3.2)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used for their experiments. Here, I will identify the specific datasets mentioned:

1. **Editing VQA (E-VQA)**: This dataset is used for the Visual Question Answering task. The authors mention that it contains 6,346 training samples and 2,849 testing samples.

2. **Editing Image Captioning (E-IC)**: This dataset is used for the Image Captioning task, with 2,093 training samples and 1,000 testing samples.

Additionally, the authors refer to other datasets that are utilized for evaluating the reliability and locality of the multimodal models:

3. **NQ Dataset**: This dataset is used for evaluating the stability of the language model component. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Kwiatkowski, T., Palomaki, J., Redfield, O., Collins, M., Parikh, A. P., Alberti, C., Epstein, D., Polosukhin, I., Devlin, J., Lee, K., Toutanova, K., Jones, L., Kelcey, M. (2019). Natural questions: a benchmark for question answering research. *Trans. Assoc. Comput. Linguistics*, 7:452–466.

4. **OK-VQA**: This dataset is used for evaluating the visual module's locality. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Marino, K., Rastegari, M., Farhadi, A., & Mottaghi, R. (2019). OK-VQA: A visual question answering benchmark requiring external knowledge. In *IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)*, pages 3195–3204.

5. **VQAv2**: This dataset is mentioned as a source of foundational edit data for the Visual Question Answering task. The citation is:
   > Goyal, Y., Khot, T., Summers-Stay, D., Batra, D., & Parikh, D. (2017). Making the V in VQA matter: Elevating the role of image understanding in visual question answering. In *2017 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)*, pages 6325–6334.

6. **COCO Caption**: This dataset is used for the Image Captioning task. The citation is:
   > Chen, X., Fang, H., Lin, T.-Y., Vedantam, R., Gupta, S., Dollar, P., & Zitnick, C. L. (2015). Microsoft COCO captions: Data collection and evaluation server. *CoRR*, abs/1504.00325.

After identifying these datasets, I will ensure to compile the full citations for each dataset as they are crucial for proper referencing in any subsequent work.

Finally, I will summarize the findings in a structured manner, ensuring that each dataset is clearly documented with its purpose and citation, ready for inclusion in any further analysis or reporting.
