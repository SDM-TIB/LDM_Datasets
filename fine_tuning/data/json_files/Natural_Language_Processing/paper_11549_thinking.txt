To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Comparative Evaluation of Recent Universal Adversarial Perturbations in Image Classification" by Juanjuan Weng et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus, which may include references to datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** in detail, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. I will look for specific mentions of datasets, including their names and any relevant details such as the number of samples, types of data, and any specific characteristics that are highlighted.

In this paper, the authors mention using two datasets for training their universal adversarial perturbations: **ImageNet** and **Microsoft COCO**. I will note the context in which these datasets are used, such as whether they are used for training, testing, or both.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access the datasets.

For **ImageNet**, the citation is:
> J. Deng, W. Dong, R. Socher, L.-J. Li, K. Li, L. Fei-Fei. "ImageNet: A large-scale hierarchical image database." In CVPR, 2009.

For **Microsoft COCO**, the citation is:
> T.-Y. Lin, M. Maire, S. Belongie, J. Hays, P. Perona, D. Ramanan, P. Dollar, C. L. Zitnick. "Microsoft COCO: Common objects in context." In ECCV, 2014.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and ease of use. This will include the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all necessary details are included for future reference.
