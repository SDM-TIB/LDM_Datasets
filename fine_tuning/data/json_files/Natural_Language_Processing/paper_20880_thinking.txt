To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On Spectrogram Analysis in a Multiple Classifier Fusion Framework for Power Grid Classification Using Electric Network Frequency" by Georgios Tzolopoulos et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental evaluation sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or data sources.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the Electric Network Frequency (ENF) and its applications, but I need to find specific datasets used in their experiments. 

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Methodology)**, where the authors describe the dataset used for their experiments. They mention using the dataset from the **2016 Signal Processing Cup**, which comprises recordings from nine distinct power grids labeled from AAA to III. This section provides crucial details about the dataset, including the types of recordings (audio and power) and their characteristics.

The paper states that the dataset includes recordings with both 50 Hz and 60 Hz ENF signals, and it describes the nature of the recordings, such as their duration and the challenges associated with audio recordings. This information is essential for understanding the dataset's context.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The authors reference the dataset as follows:

- For the **2016 Signal Processing Cup dataset**, the citation is:
  > Hajj-Ahmad, A. (2016). ENF power frequency data for location forensics. https://dx.doi.org/10.21227/H2159S. Signal Processing Cup.

This citation provides the necessary details to reference the dataset accurately.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including its description and citation, into a structured format for clarity and future reference. This will ensure that I have all the relevant details about the dataset used in the research paper.
