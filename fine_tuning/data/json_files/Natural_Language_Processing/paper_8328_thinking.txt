To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Improving Bilingual Lexicon Induction with Cross-Encoder Reranking" by Yaoyiran Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental setup sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the creation of a **word similarity dataset**, which indicates that a dataset is indeed involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental setup section** (section 4), where the authors explicitly state the datasets used for their experiments. They mention two standard BLI datasets:

1. **XLING Dataset**: This dataset provides BLI training and test lexicons covering 8 languages from diverse language families. The authors specify that they consider all 14 EN→∗ and ∗→EN BLI directions.

2. **PanLex-BLI Dataset**: This dataset is oriented towards low-resource languages and comprises a subset of six diverse languages, yielding a total of 30 BLI directions.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **XLING dataset**, the citation is:
  > Goran Glavaš, Robert Litschko, Sebastian Ruder, and Ivan Vulić. *How to (properly) evaluate cross-lingual word embeddings: On strong baselines, comparative analyses, and some misconceptions*. In Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL’19), pages 710–721, Florence, Italy. Association for Computational Linguistics, 2019.

- For the **PanLex-BLI dataset**, the citation is:
  > David Kamholz, Jonathan Pool, and Susan Colowick. *PanLex: Building a resource for panlingual lexical translation*. In Proceedings of the Ninth International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC’14), pages 3145–3150, Reykjavik, Iceland. European Language Resources Association (ELRA), 2014.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
