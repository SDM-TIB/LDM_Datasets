To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Layer-wise Auto-Weighting for Non-Stationary Test-Time Adaptation" by Junyoung Park et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to find any references to datasets. In the abstract, the authors mention conducting experiments on **CIFAR-10C, CIFAR-100C, and ImageNet-C**, which indicates that these are the datasets used in their research.

Next, I will look into **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the datasets. They describe the datasets as follows:

1. **CIFAR-10C**: This dataset is a collection of images that have been corrupted with various types of noise and distortions. It is derived from the original CIFAR-10 dataset and includes 15 different corruption types.

2. **CIFAR-100C**: Similar to CIFAR-10C, this dataset is based on the CIFAR-100 dataset and also includes images corrupted with various types of noise and distortions, following the same corruption types as CIFAR-10C.

3. **ImageNet-C**: This dataset is derived from the ImageNet dataset and includes images that have been corrupted in a similar manner to CIFAR-10C and CIFAR-100C, allowing for evaluation of model robustness against common corruptions.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide performance metrics for their method on these datasets, confirming their use in the evaluation of the proposed approach.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **CIFAR-10** and **CIFAR-100**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton, et al. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. 2009.

- For **ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, and Li Fei-Fei. *Imagenet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 248â€“255, 2009.

With this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
