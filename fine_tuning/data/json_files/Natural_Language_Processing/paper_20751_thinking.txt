To extract datasets from the research paper titled "RankingSHAP â€“ Listwise Feature Attribution Explanations for Ranking Models" by Maria Heuss et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of RankingSHAP on commonly used learning-to-rank datasets, which indicates that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 6), where the authors mention two specific datasets used for their experiments:

1. **MQ2008 Dataset**: This dataset consists of 800 queries with pre-computed query-document feature vectors of dimension 46. It is a well-known dataset in the information retrieval community.

2. **MSLR Dataset**: This dataset consists of 10,000 queries with query-document feature vectors of dimension 136. It is also a standard dataset used for learning-to-rank tasks.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **MQ2008 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Tao Qin and Tie-Yan Liu. *Introducing LETOR 4.0 Datasets*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1306.2597, 2013.

- For the **MSLR Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Tao Qin and Tie-Yan Liu. *LETOR: Benchmark Dataset for Research on Learning to Rank for Information Retrieval*. In Proceedings of the 30th Annual International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval, pages 1-8, 2007.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ready for further processing or review.
