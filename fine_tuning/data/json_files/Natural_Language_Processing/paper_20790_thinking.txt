To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The Solution for the ICCV 2023 1st Scientific Figure Captioning Challenge" by Dian Chao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, method, and experiment sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the study involves improving captions for figures and highlights the use of an official dataset comprising approximately 400,000 data samples. This indicates that a dataset is indeed present.

Next, I will focus on the **experiment section**, where the authors provide specific details about the dataset used. They mention that the dataset consists of around 400,000 samples, with a breakdown of the training set containing 333,472 samples and both validation and test sets containing 47,639 samples each. This section confirms the existence of a dataset and provides quantitative details.

I will also check the **method section** for any additional context about the dataset, such as its structure or the nature of the data samples. The authors describe that each sample includes an image, its corresponding OCR information, mention information, and the entire paragraph from which the mention originates. This gives me a clearer understanding of what the dataset entails.

Now, I will look at the **references section** to find the full citation for the dataset. However, the paper does not provide a specific citation for the dataset itself, as it is described as being provided by the official competition organizers. Therefore, I will note that the dataset is associated with the ICCV 2023 1st Scientific Figure Captioning Challenge.

Based on this analysis, I will summarize the dataset information as follows:

1. **Dataset Name**: Official Competition Dataset for ICCV 2023 1st Scientific Figure Captioning Challenge
   - **Description**: This dataset comprises approximately 400,000 data samples, each consisting of an image, its corresponding OCR information, mention information, and the entire paragraph from which the mention originates. The training set contains 333,472 samples, while both the validation and test sets consist of 47,639 samples each.
   - **Citation**: The dataset is provided by the official competition organizers and does not have a specific citation in the paper.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
