To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The FIGNEWS Shared Task on News Media Narratives" by Wajdi Zaghouani et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the shared task involves bias and propaganda annotation in multilingual news posts, which suggests that there may be datasets related to these tasks. The introduction further elaborates on the task's objectives and the number of teams involved, hinting at the scale of the data collected.

Next, I will look for specific sections that might detail the datasets used, such as **Data Collection and Selection** or **Methodology**. In this paper, the **Data Collection and Selection** section describes how the authors collected Facebook posts related to the Israel War on Gaza in five languages. They retrieved approximately 300,000 posts per language, narrowing it down to 15,000 posts for annotation. This indicates that there is a significant dataset created for the shared task.

I will note the details of the dataset:
- **Dataset Name**: FIGNEWS Dataset
- **Description**: A collection of 15,000 multilingual social media posts (in English, French, Arabic, Hebrew, and Hindi) related to the Israel War on Gaza, annotated for bias and propaganda.
- **Data Points**: 15,000 posts, with 3,000 posts per language, covering ten key moments of the war.

Next, I will check the **References section** for any citations related to the datasets. The paper provides links to the dataset and code repositories, which are crucial for proper citation. The relevant citations for the dataset are:
- **Dataset Citation**: 
  > Zaghouani, W., Jarrar, M., Habash, N., Bouamor, H., Zitouni, I., Diab, M., El-Beltagy, S. R., & AbuOdeh, M. (2024). The FIGNEWS Shared Task on News Media Narratives. In Proceedings of the Second Arabic Natural Language Processing Conference (ArabicNLP 2024), Bangkok, Thailand. Association for Computational Linguistics. Available at: https://github.com/CAMeL-Lab/FIGNEWS-2024 & https://huggingface.co/datasets/CAMeL-Lab/FIGNEWS-2024

Finally, I will compile the extracted information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the dataset as it is critical for proper attribution and future reference.

In summary, I have identified the FIGNEWS dataset, its description, and the citation needed for proper acknowledgment. This systematic approach ensures that I capture all relevant details accurately.
