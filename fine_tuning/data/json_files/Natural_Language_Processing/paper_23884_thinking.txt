To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Graph Bottlenecked Social Recommendation" by Yonghui Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview, and the introduction often highlights the datasets used for evaluation.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of social recommendation and mention that they will conduct empirical studies on three public datasets. This indicates that datasets are involved, but I need to find their specific names.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors explicitly list three datasets used for their experiments:

1. **Douban-Book**: This dataset contains user-user social links and user-item interactions, with specific statistics provided in Table 1.
2. **Yelp**: Similar to Douban-Book, this dataset also includes user-user social links and user-item interactions, with its own set of statistics.
3. **Epinions**: This dataset follows the same structure as the previous two, with user-user social links and user-item interactions.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations typically include the authors, title, publication venue, and year. However, in this paper, the datasets are not attributed to specific papers, which is common for publicly available datasets. Instead, the authors reference the datasets as follows:

- For **Douban-Book**, the citation is:
  > Douban. Douban-Book Dataset. Available at: [Douban](https://www.douban.com).

- For **Yelp**, the citation is:
  > Yelp. Yelp Dataset Challenge. Available at: [Yelp](https://www.yelp.com/dataset).

- For **Epinions**, the citation is:
  > Epinions. Epinions Dataset. Available at: [Epinions](http://www.epinions.com).

Now that I have identified the datasets and their respective citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use.

In summary, I will ensure that I have accurately captured the names of the datasets and their full citations, which are crucial for proper attribution and future reference.
