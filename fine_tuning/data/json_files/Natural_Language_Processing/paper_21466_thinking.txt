To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SurvMamba: State Space Model with Multi-grained Multi-modal Interaction for Survival Prediction" by Jiajing Xie et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted comprehensive evaluations on five TCGA datasets, which indicates that these datasets are crucial for the study. The introduction further elaborates on the integration of pathological images and genomic data for survival prediction, hinting at the datasets used.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors explicitly state that they used five public cancer datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). The specific datasets mentioned are:

1. **Breast Invasive Carcinoma (BRCA)**: This dataset includes 869 cases.
2. **Bladder Urothelial Carcinoma (BLCA)**: This dataset includes 359 cases.
3. **Colon and Rectum Adenocarcinoma (COADREAD)**: This dataset includes 296 cases.
4. **Uterine Corpus Endometrial Carcinoma (UCEC)**: This dataset includes 480 cases.
5. **Lung Adenocarcinoma (LUAD)**: This dataset includes 453 cases.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. However, since these datasets are publicly available from TCGA, I will provide the citation for TCGA itself as the source of these datasets:

- For TCGA, the citation is:
  > The Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network. *The Cancer Genome Atlas*. Available at: http://www.cancer.gov/tcga

Now that I have identified the datasets and their source, I will compile this information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for TCGA as the authoritative source for the datasets used in the study.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for review or further processing, ensuring that all relevant details are accurately captured.
