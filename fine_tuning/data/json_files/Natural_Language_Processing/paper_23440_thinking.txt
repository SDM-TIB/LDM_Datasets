To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MAD: Multi-Alignment MEG-to-Text Decoding" by Yiqian Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. In the abstract, the authors mention achieving an impressive BLEU-1 score on the **GWilliams dataset**, which indicates that this dataset is crucial for their experiments. This prompts me to look for more details about this dataset.

Next, I will proceed to the **experiments section**, specifically **section 4.1 (Dataset)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the **GWilliams dataset**. Here, they explain that it is a magnetoencephalography (MEG) dataset designed for assessing natural speech comprehension, featuring recordings from 27 participants. The dataset includes information about the stories used, the number of participants, and the experimental setup, which is essential for understanding the dataset's context.

In addition to the dataset description, I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the **GWilliams dataset**. The citation provided in the paper is:
> Laura Gwilliams, Graham Flick, Alec Marantz, Liina Pylkkänen, David Poeppel, and Jean-Rémi King. *Introducing meg-masc a high-quality magneto-encephalography dataset for evaluating natural speech processing*. Scientific Data, 10(1), December 2023.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the key details about the **GWilliams dataset**:

1. **GWilliams Dataset**: This dataset is designed for evaluating natural speech processing using MEG recordings. It includes data from 27 participants who listened to four different stories during the experiment.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that highlights the dataset's name, description, and citation, ensuring that I have accurately captured all necessary details for future reference or processing.
