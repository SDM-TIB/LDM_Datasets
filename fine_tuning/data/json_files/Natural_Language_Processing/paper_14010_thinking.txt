To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Automatic Personalized Impression Generation for PET Reports Using Large Language Models" by Xin Tie et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions a corpus of **37,370 retrospective PET reports**, which indicates a significant dataset is involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Materials and Methods)**, specifically **subsection 2.1 (Dataset Collection)**, where the authors describe the dataset in detail. Here, they mention that they collected **37,370 retrospective PET reports** from their institution between January 2010 and January 2023. This dataset is crucial for their experiments.

Additionally, they specify that **4,000 reports were randomly selected for internal testing**, **2,000 for validation**, and **31,370 for training**. This breakdown provides insight into how the dataset was utilized.

Furthermore, the authors mention an **external testing dataset** consisting of **100 whole-body PET/CT reports** from the Children’s Oncology Group AHOD1331 Hodgkin lymphoma clinical trial, which is another dataset of interest.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The paper does not provide specific citations for the datasets themselves, but I can summarize the information as follows:

1. **Internal PET Reports Dataset**: This dataset comprises **37,370 retrospective PET reports** collected from the authors' institution. The dataset is not attributed to a specific publication but is a product of their own research efforts.

2. **External Testing Dataset**: The **100 whole-body PET/CT reports** are associated with the Children’s Oncology Group AHOD1331 Hodgkin lymphoma clinical trial, which can be cited as:
   > Castellino SM, Pei Q, Parsons SK, et al. Brentuximab Vedotin with Chemotherapy in Pediatric High-Risk Hodgkin’s Lymphoma. *N Engl J Med*. 2022;387(18):1649–1660. doi: http://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa2206660.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for clarity and future reference. This will ensure that I have accurately documented the datasets used in the research paper, along with their relevant citations.
