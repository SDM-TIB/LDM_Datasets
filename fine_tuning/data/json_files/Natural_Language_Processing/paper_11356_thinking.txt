To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Weakly supervised information extraction from inscrutable handwritten document images" by Sujoy Paul et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract indicates that the research focuses on extracting medicine names from handwritten prescriptions, which suggests that there is a dataset related to handwritten prescriptions. The introduction further elaborates on the challenges of OCR in this context, hinting at the existence of a specific dataset used for evaluation.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors describe a **Prescription Image Dataset** that consists of 9,645 images written by 117 doctors, which is crucial for their experiments. This dataset is explicitly mentioned in the experiments section, providing details about its composition and usage.

I will also check the **results** section to confirm that the dataset is indeed used for evaluating the proposed methods. The authors state that they use 80% of the dataset for training and 20% for evaluation, which reinforces the importance of this dataset in their research.

Now, I will gather the full citation for the dataset from the **references section**. However, since the dataset is not attributed to a specific paper or publication, I will note the details provided in the text instead. The dataset is described as follows:

- **Prescription Image Dataset**: Contains 9,645 images of handwritten prescriptions from 117 doctors, with an average of 4.5 medicines per image.

Since there is no formal citation provided for this dataset in the references, I will document it based on the information available in the paper.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and any relevant details that were mentioned in the paper.

In summary, the key steps I took include:
1. Reading the abstract and introduction to identify the focus on handwritten prescriptions.
2. Locating the dataset description in the methodology and experiments sections.
3. Confirming the dataset's usage in the results section.
4. Documenting the dataset details, including the number of images and doctors involved, as no formal citation was provided.

Now, I will prepare the dataset entry for the output.
