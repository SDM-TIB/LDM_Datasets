To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Referring Atomic Video Action Recognition" by Kunyu Peng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract introduces the RefAVA dataset, which contains 36,630 instances with manually annotated textual descriptions. This indicates that a dataset is indeed present and is central to the research.

Next, I will look into **section 3.1 (Introduction of the RefAVA Dataset)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset. They mention that the RefAVA dataset is established using 17,946 video clips from the public AVA dataset, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's origin and purpose.

In this section, the authors describe the dataset's characteristics, including the number of instances, the types of annotations, and the diversity of scenarios covered. They also mention the split of the dataset into training, validation, and test sets, which is important for understanding how the dataset can be utilized in experiments.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the AVA dataset, as it is the foundational dataset from which the RefAVA dataset is derived. The citation for the AVA dataset is:

- **AVA Dataset**: 
  > Gu, C., Sun, C., Ross, D.A., Vondrick, C., Pantofaru, C., Li, Y., Vijayanarasimhan, S., Toderici, G., Ricco, S., Sukthankar, R., Schmid, C., Malik, J. (2018). *AVA: A video dataset of spatio-temporally localized atomic visual actions*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2018.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and full citation for each dataset mentioned in the paper.

1. **RefAVA Dataset**: 
   - Description: A dataset for Referring Atomic Video Action Recognition containing 36,630 instances with textual descriptions of individuals, derived from 17,946 video clips of the AVA dataset.
   - Citation: The dataset itself does not have a separate citation but is based on the AVA dataset.

2. **AVA Dataset**: 
   - Description: A video dataset of spatio-temporally localized atomic visual actions.
   - Citation: Gu, C., Sun, C., Ross, D.A., Vondrick, C., Pantofaru, C., Li, Y., Vijayanarasimhan, S., Toderici, G., Ricco, S., Sukthankar, R., Schmid, C., Malik, J. (2018). *AVA: A video dataset of spatio-temporally localized atomic visual actions*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2018.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for further processing or review.
