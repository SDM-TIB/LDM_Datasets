To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Focus on Your Instruction: Fine-grained and Multi-instruction Image Editing by Attention Modulation" by Qin Guo and Tianwei Lin, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for evaluation or experimentation.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, the authors mention filtering 5,000 localized edit-type images from the **IP2P dataset** for single-instruction editing and gathering 100 real images for multi-instruction editing. This indicates that the IP2P dataset is a primary dataset used in their research.

I will also check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper cites the IP2P dataset as follows:

- For the **IP2P dataset**, the citation is:
  > Tim Brooks, Aleksander Holynski, and Alexei A. Efros. *Instructpix2pix: Learning to follow image editing instructions*. In arXiv, 2023.

Since the paper does not provide additional datasets or their citations, I will only document the IP2P dataset.

Now, I will compile the dataset entry with the full citation into a structured format that is ready for review or further processing. This ensures that I have accurately captured the necessary information regarding the dataset used in the research.
