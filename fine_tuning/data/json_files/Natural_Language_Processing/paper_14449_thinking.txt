To extract datasets from the research paper titled "GENSIM: Generating Robotic Simulation Tasks via Large Language Models" by Lirui Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the datasets that might be referenced. The abstract mentions that the authors expanded an existing benchmark by ten times to over 100 tasks, which indicates that there is a dataset involved in this expansion.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments** section, particularly in **section 3** where the authors discuss their evaluation methods. I will pay close attention to any tables or figures that might summarize the datasets used for training and evaluation.

In **section 2.1 (Task Creator)**, the authors mention using the **Ravens benchmark** as a dataset for generating tasks. This is a crucial dataset to note as it serves as the foundation for their task generation process.

Additionally, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper cites several works, and I will need to ensure I capture the correct citations for the datasets used.

The relevant datasets identified in the paper are:

1. **Ravens Benchmark**: This dataset focuses on motion primitives such as pushing and pick-and-place tasks. It is essential for the authors' task generation framework.
   - Citation: Zeng, A., Yu, T., et al. (2021). *Ravens: A Benchmark for Robotic Manipulation Tasks*. In Proceedings of the Conference on Robot Learning (CoRL).

2. **CLIPort Tasks**: This dataset is referenced multiple times throughout the paper, particularly in the context of evaluating the performance of the generated tasks.
   - Citation: Shridhar, M., Manuelli, L., & Fox, D. (2022). *CLIPort: What and Where Pathways for Robotic Manipulation*. In Conference on Robot Learning (CoRL).

After identifying these datasets, I will compile the information into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations. This will ensure that I have a comprehensive overview of the datasets referenced in the paper, which can be useful for further research or application.

Finally, I will summarize the findings and prepare the dataset entries for any required documentation or reporting.
