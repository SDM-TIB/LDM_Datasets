To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Money, Time, and Grant Design" by Kyle Myers and Wei Yang Tham, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses conducting thought experiments and surveys, which may imply the use of datasets, but I need to look for specific names or references.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section** where the authors describe their empirical approach. They mention using a "nationally representative sample of research-active professors" and refer to the **Dimensions dataset** for grant data. This indicates that the Dimensions dataset is a primary source of data for their analysis.

In the **results section**, I will look for any additional datasets that may have been used to support their findings. The authors discuss the distribution of grant designs and cite the **National Science Foundation (NSF) HERD survey** as a source for institutional-level data. This is another dataset that needs to be documented.

I will also check the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The citations will provide the necessary details for each dataset, including authors, titles, publication venues, and years.

Based on my findings, I will compile the following datasets:

1. **Dimensions Dataset**: This dataset aggregates grant data from various funders and is crucial for understanding the distribution of research grants.
   - Citation: Digital Science. (2018). *Dimensions* [software]. Available from https://app.dimensions.ai. Accessed in 2023, under licence agreement.

2. **National Science Foundation (NSF) HERD Survey**: This survey provides institutional-level data on research funding flows.
   - Citation: National Science Foundation. (2023). *Higher Education Research and Development Survey (HERD)*. Available from https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/srvyherd/. Accessed in 2023.

After gathering this information, I will ensure that each dataset is clearly documented with its full citation, as this is critical for proper attribution and future reference. Finally, I will summarize the datasets in a structured format for easy access and review.
