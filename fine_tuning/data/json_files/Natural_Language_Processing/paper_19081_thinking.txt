To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Selective Reflection-Tuning: Student-Selected Data Recycling for LLM Instruction-Tuning" by Ming Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the application of their method to **Alpaca** and **WizardLM** data, indicating that these are datasets used in their research. This is a strong lead to follow.

Next, I will look into **section 4.1 (Base Datasets)**, where the authors provide specific details about the datasets they utilized:

1. **Alpaca Dataset**: The paper states that the Alpaca dataset, sourced from Stanford University, contains **52,002 instruction samples** and was developed using the self-instruct paradigm. This dataset is crucial for their experiments.

2. **WizardLM Dataset**: The authors describe the WizardLM dataset as a refined collection with **250,000 instruction samples**, specifically focusing on the **WizardLM-7b subset**, which comprises **70,000 samples**. This dataset is also pivotal for their methodology.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **Alpaca Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Rohan Taori, Ishaan Gulrajani, Tianyi Zhang, Yann Dubois, Xuechen Li, Carlos Guestrin, Percy Liang, and Tatsunori B. Hashimoto. *Stanford Alpaca: An instruction-following LLaMA model*. https://github.com/tatsu-lab/stanford_alpaca, 2023.

- For the **WizardLM Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yang Xu, Yongqiang Yao, Yufan Huang, Mengnan Qi, Maoquan Wang, Bin Gu, and Neel Sundaresan. *WizardLM: Empowering large language models to follow complex instructions*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2309.11235, 2023.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use.

In summary, I have extracted the following datasets from the paper:
1. **Alpaca Dataset** - 52,002 instruction samples.
2. **WizardLM Dataset** - 250,000 instruction samples, focusing on the WizardLM-7b subset with 70,000 samples.

I will ensure to document these datasets with their full citations for clarity and proper attribution.
