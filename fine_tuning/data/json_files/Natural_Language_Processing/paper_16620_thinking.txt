To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Transformer-Empowered Multi-Modal Item Embedding for Enhanced Image Search in E-commerce" by Chang Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract discusses the deployment of the Multi-modal Item Embedding Model (MIEM) and its impact on the Shopee image search platform, which suggests that there may be datasets related to user queries and product images.

Next, I will focus on the **Application Development and Deployment** section, where the authors describe the training data acquisition process. They mention leveraging user click logs as the training data for MIEM, which is represented as a triplet of query images, clicked item titles, and clicked item image lists. This indicates that there is a dataset derived from user interactions on the Shopee platform.

I will also check the **Evaluation** section, where the authors describe the offline evaluation process. They constructed a dataset based on real-world user queries collected from the Indonesia market, which contains user query images and 3 million Shopee products. This dataset is crucial for understanding the performance of the MIEM model.

Now, I will compile the details of the identified datasets and retrieve their full citations from the **References section** of the paper:

1. **User Click Logs Dataset**: This dataset consists of user queries and their corresponding clicked products, represented as triplets. It is used to train the MIEM model.
   - Citation: Not explicitly cited in the paper, but it is derived from user interactions on the Shopee platform.

2. **Real-World User Queries Dataset**: This dataset is based on user queries collected from the Indonesia market, containing user query images and 3 million Shopee products.
   - Citation: Not explicitly cited in the paper, but it is based on user interactions and evaluations conducted by external annotators.

Since the paper does not provide formal citations for the datasets, I will note that the datasets are derived from the Shopee platform's user interactions and evaluations, which may not have specific publications associated with them.

Finally, I will summarize the datasets in a structured format for clarity and future reference, ensuring that I highlight the importance of the datasets in the context of the research findings.
