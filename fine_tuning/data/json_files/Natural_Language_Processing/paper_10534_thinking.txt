To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DUMB: A Benchmark for Smart Evaluation of Dutch Models" by Wietse de Vries et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract introduces the Dutch Model Benchmark (DUMB) and states that it includes a diverse set of datasets for various tasks. This indicates that multiple datasets are likely discussed throughout the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **section 2 (DUMB Tasks)**, where the authors describe the nine tasks included in the benchmark. Each task is associated with a specific dataset. I will carefully note down the names of these datasets as they are mentioned in the context of each task.

The tasks and their corresponding datasets are as follows:

1. **Part-Of-Speech Tagging (POS)**: The dataset used is the **Lassy Small v6.0 corpus** (van Noord et al., 2013).
2. **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: The dataset used is the **SoNaR-1 v1.2.2 corpus** (Oostdijk et al., 2013).
3. **Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD)**: The dataset used is derived from **DutchSemCor** (Vossen et al., 2012).
4. **Pronoun Resolution (PR)**: The dataset used is based on **SemEval2010 Task 1** (Recasens et al., 2010).
5. **Causal Reasoning (CR)**: The dataset used is the **COPA-NL** dataset, a translation of the original COPA dataset (Gordon et al., 2012).
6. **Natural Language Inference (NLI)**: The dataset used is **SICK-NL** (Wijnholds and Moortgat, 2021).
7. **Sentiment Analysis (SA)**: The dataset used is the **Dutch Book Reviews Dataset v3.0 (DBRD)** (Van der Burgh and Verberne, 2019).
8. **Abusive Language Detection (ALD)**: The dataset used is **DALC v2.0** (Ruitenbeek et al., 2022).
9. **Question Answering (QA)**: The dataset used is **SQuAD-NL**, a translation of the SQuAD dataset (Rajpurkar et al., 2016, 2018).

After identifying the datasets, I will proceed to the **References section** to gather the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the benchmark.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their full citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
