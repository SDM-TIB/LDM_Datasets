To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Continual Learning with Low Rank Adaptation" by Martin Wistuba et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, experiments, and conclusion sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss continual learning and mention that they evaluate their method on various benchmarks. This suggests that datasets are involved, but I need to find specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this paper, they mention three specific datasets:

1. **CORe50**: This dataset is a benchmark for continual object recognition, consisting of 50 classes from 11 different datasets. It is crucial to note the details provided about the dataset's structure and purpose.

2. **DomainNet**: This dataset is used for image classification and contains 345 classes across 6 different datasets. The authors highlight its relevance for domain-incremental learning.

3. **Split CIFAR-100**: This dataset is a modified version of CIFAR-100, split into 10 datasets, each containing 10 contiguous classes. It is used for class-incremental learning experiments.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **CORe50**, the citation is:
  > Vincenzo Lomonaco and Davide Maltoni. *CORe50: a new dataset and benchmark for continuous object recognition*. In Proceedings of the 1st Annual Conference on Robot Learning, volume 78 of Proceedings of Machine Learning Research, pages 17â€“26, PMLR, 2017.

- For **DomainNet**, the citation is:
  > Peng, Xingchao, et al. *Moment matching for multi-source domain adaptation*. In ICCV, 2019.

- For **Split CIFAR-100**, the citation is:
  > Zhou, Kaiyang, et al. *Learning to prompt for vision-language models*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2109.01134, 2021.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or analysis.
