To extract datasets from the research paper titled "TaDeR: A New Task Dependency Recommendation for Project Management Platform" by Quynh Nguyen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors performed extensive experiments on two different large projects, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section** where the authors describe their approach to data collection and evaluation. Here, they explicitly mention two datasets: **MDLSITE** and **FLUME**. I will gather detailed information about these datasets, including their characteristics and how they were used in the experiments.

In the **data collection section**, the authors provide specific details about the datasets:
1. **MDLSITE Dataset**: This dataset is associated with the Moodle project and contains a significant number of observations (issues) tracked using Jira.
2. **FLUME Dataset**: This dataset is associated with the Apache project and also contains a substantial number of observations.

I will also check the **results section** to confirm that these datasets were indeed used for the experiments and to note any performance metrics reported for each dataset.

Now, I will compile the full citations for each dataset based on the information provided in the paper. The citations are as follows:

- For the **MDLSITE Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Moodle Community Sites. *Moodle Tracker*. Available at: https://tracker.moodle.org/projects/MDLSITE

- For the **FLUME Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Apache Flume. *Apache Flume*. Available at: https://flume.apache.org/

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets in a structured manner, ensuring that I include the full citations as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
