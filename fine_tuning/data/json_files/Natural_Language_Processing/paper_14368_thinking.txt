To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Investigating Shift Equivalence of Convolutional Neural Networks in Industrial Defect Segmentation" by Zhen Qu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract mentions that the experimental results are demonstrated on the **micro surface defect (MSD) dataset** and four real-world industrial defect datasets. This indicates that there are at least two datasets to document.

Next, I will look for specific details about these datasets in the **experiments section**. In this section, the authors describe the **micro surface defect (MSD) dataset**, which consists of 35 images of surface defects in silicon steel strips, categorized into two groups: spot-defect images and steel-pit-defect images. The dataset is noted for its random background textures and the small portion of the image occupied by defects.

The authors also mention that they used **four additional real-world industrial defect datasets** for validation. However, they do not provide specific names or details about these datasets in the text. I will need to check the **references section** to see if any of the datasets are cited there.

In the references, I will look for any papers that might describe the datasets used in the experiments. If the authors have cited the original sources of these datasets, I will extract the full citations for each dataset.

Based on the information gathered, I will compile the following datasets:

1. **Micro Surface Defect (MSD) Dataset**: 
   - Description: Contains 35 images of surface defects in silicon steel strips, categorized into spot-defect images and steel-pit-defect images.
   - Citation: 
     > K. Song and Y. Yan, “Micro surface defect detection method for silicon steel strip based on saliency convex active contour model,” *Mathematical Problems in Engineering*, vol. 2013, 2013.

2. **Four Real-World Industrial Defect Datasets**: 
   - Since the paper does not provide specific names or citations for these datasets, I will note that they are used but not detailed in the paper. If any references are found that describe these datasets, I will include them.

Finally, I will ensure that I have the full citations for each dataset, as this is crucial for proper documentation and future reference. After compiling the information, I will format it according to the required structure for clarity and completeness.
