To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Efficient Reinforcement Learning via Decoupling Exploration and Utilization" by Jingpu Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and it may mention specific datasets used for evaluation. 

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors often discuss the context of their research and may reference datasets used in previous studies or their own experiments. I will look for any specific names or descriptions of datasets.

Then, I will examine the **experiments section** in detail, as this section typically contains information about the datasets used for testing the proposed methods. I will look for any subsections that specifically mention datasets, such as "Datasets" or "Experimental Setup."

In this paper, the authors mention using the **DMControl suite** and **Mujoco environments** for their experiments. I will note these environments as they are commonly used benchmarks in reinforcement learning research.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets or environments mentioned. For the DMControl suite, I will look for the original paper that describes it, which is likely cited in the references.

The citation for the DMControl suite is:
> Yuval Tassa, Yotam Doron, A. Muldal, Tom Erez, Yazhe Li, Diego de Las Casas, David Budden, Abbas Abdolmaleki, Josh Merel, Andrew Lefrancq, Tim Lillicrap, and Martin Riedmiller. *Deepmind control suite*. In Conference/Workshop where it was published, 2018.

For the Mujoco environments, I will also look for the original paper that describes Mujoco:
> Emanuel Todorov, Tom Erez, and Yuval Tassa. *Mujoco: A physics engine for model-based control*. 2012.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset or environment used in the experiments. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets referenced in the paper.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for easy reference and further processing.
