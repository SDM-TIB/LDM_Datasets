To extract datasets from the research paper titled "FoRA: Low-Rank Adaptation Model beyond Multimodal Siamese Network" by Yusi Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the proposed method is validated on two multimodal object detection datasets, which indicates that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section (Section 4)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. In **Section 4.1**, they describe the two datasets:

1. **DroneVehicle Dataset**: This dataset is characterized as a large-scale drone-based visible-infrared dataset containing 953,087 vehicle instances across 56,878 images, with oriented bounding boxes for five categories (car, bus, truck, van, and freight car). The dataset is collected under various scenes and lighting conditions.

2. **LLVIP Dataset**: This dataset is described as a recently released visible-infrared paired dataset collected in low-light environments, containing 16,836 image pairs with horizontal boxes for one category (person).

To confirm the details of these datasets, I will also check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **DroneVehicle Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yiming Sun, Bing Cao, Pengfei Zhu, and Qinghua Hu. *Drone-based RGB-infrared cross-modality vehicle detection via uncertainty-aware learning*. IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology (TCSVT), 32(10):6700–6713, 2022.

- For the **LLVIP Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Xinyu Jia, Chuang Zhu, Minzhen Li, Wenqi Tang, and Wenli Zhou. *LLVIP: A visible-infrared paired dataset for low-light vision*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 3496–3504, 2021.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations.
