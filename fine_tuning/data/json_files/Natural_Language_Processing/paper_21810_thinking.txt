To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Bridging the Gap Between Theory and Practice: Benchmarking Transfer Evolutionary Optimization" by Yaqing Hou et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's objectives and may hint at the datasets used for benchmarking.

Next, I will focus on the **section IV (Problems Description)**, where the authors describe the three practical problems included in their benchmarking suite. This section is likely to contain explicit mentions of datasets or problem instances that serve as datasets for their experiments.

In this section, the authors introduce three benchmark problems:
1. **Knapsack Problem**: They mention generating synthetic instances based on relationships between weights and values, which indicates that these instances serve as a dataset for the knapsack problem.
2. **Planar Robotic Arm Problem**: The authors describe how they generate instances for this problem, which also implies the creation of a dataset based on various configurations of robotic arms.
3. **Minimalistic Attacks**: This section discusses the setup for attacking reinforcement learning policies, which involves using frames from specific games as datasets.

I will also check the **experiments section** to confirm the datasets used in the experiments and any specific configurations or parameters associated with them.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets or related works mentioned in the paper. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for the datasets used.

For the datasets identified, I will ensure to document:
- The name of the dataset.
- A brief description of its contents and purpose.
- The full citation for each dataset as referenced in the paper.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly presents each dataset along with its citation, ensuring that all relevant details are included for future reference or analysis.
