To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Koala: An Index for Quantifying Overlaps with Pre-training Corpora" by Thuy-Trang Vu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** to get an overview of the paper's focus and any datasets that may be referenced. The abstract mentions that Koala indexes the public portion of the OPT 175B pre-training data, which indicates that there is at least one dataset involved.

Next, I will examine **section 2.2 (Corpora Coverage)**, where the authors provide a detailed list of the corpora covered by Koala. This section is likely to contain the names and descriptions of the datasets used in their analysis. The following datasets are mentioned:

1. **BookCorpus**: A dataset obtained from Hugging Face, originally described in the paper by Zhu et al. (2015).
2. **CCNewsv2**: A dataset extracted from English news published between 2016 and September 2021, using the news-please crawler (Nagel, 2016).
3. **The Pile**: A diverse dataset for language modeling that includes several subsets, including Pile-CC, USPTO Backgrounds, Gutenberg, OpenWebTexts, OpenSubtitles, Wikipedia, DM Mathematics, and HackerNews (Gao et al., 2021).
4. **Pushshift Reddit**: A dataset of English comments and submissions from Reddit, covering posts from 2005 to 2019 (Roller et al., 2021).

In the **References section**, I will locate the full citations for each of these datasets to ensure proper attribution. The citations are as follows:

- For **BookCorpus**:
  > Yukun Zhu, Ryan Kiros, Rich Zemel, Ruslan Salakhutdinov, Raquel Urtasun, Antonio Torralba, and Sanja Fidler. *Aligning books and movies: Towards story-like visual explanations by watching movies and reading books*. In The IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2015.

- For **CCNewsv2**:
  > Sebastian Nagel. *CC-News*. 2016.

- For **The Pile**:
  > Leo Gao, Stella Biderman, Sid Black, Laurence Golding, Travis Hoppe, Charles Foster, Jason Phang, Horace He, Anish Thite, Noa Nabeshima, Shawn Presser, and Connor Leahy. *The pile: An 800gb dataset of diverse text for language modeling*. CoRR, abs/2101.00027, 2021.

- For **Pushshift Reddit**:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or analysis. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets referenced in the paper along with their proper citations.
