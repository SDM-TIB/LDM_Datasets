To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Word Embeddings Revisited: Do LLMs Offer Something New?" by Matthew Freestone et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, experiments, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's focus, but I will need to delve deeper into the body of the paper for specific dataset details.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss various word embedding techniques and their evolution, but they do not mention specific datasets yet. I will continue to the **experiments section** where datasets are more likely to be detailed.

In **section 2.2 (Dataset)**, the authors explicitly mention the **Bigger Analogy Test Set (BATS)**, describing it as an extension of the original analogy task set introduced by Mikolov et al. (2013b) and Gladkova et al. (2016). They highlight that BATS is a larger set of related word pairs, which is crucial for their evaluations.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the BATS dataset. The relevant citation is:

- For **Bigger Analogy Test Set (BATS)**, the citation is:
  > Anna Gladkova, Aleksandr Drozd, and Satoshi Matsouka. *Analogy-based detection of morphological and semantic relations with word embeddings: what works and what doesn’t*. In Proceedings of the NAACL Student Research Workshop, pages 8–15, San Diego, California. Association for Computational Linguistics, 2016.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will ensure that I format this information clearly and accurately for any downstream processing or review.

In summary, the key steps I took were:
1. Read through the abstract and introduction for context.
2. Focus on the experiments section to identify specific datasets.
3. Locate the full citation in the references for proper attribution.

With this information, I can now compile the dataset entry for BATS, ensuring that the citation is included for completeness.
