To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Coarse-to-Fine Lexicon-based Retriever for Few-shot and Zero-shot Entity Linking" by Shijue Huang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of few-shot and zero-shot entity linking, but I need to look for specific datasets. The **experiments section** is crucial, as it typically contains detailed information about the datasets used for evaluation.

Upon reaching **section 4.1 (Data)**, I find the following dataset mentioned:

1. **Hansel Dataset**: This dataset is described as a benchmark for few-shot and zero-shot entity linking in simplified Chinese. It includes a training set derived from Wikipedia and a test set that consists of Few-Shot (FS) and Zero-Shot (ZS) settings. The authors provide statistics about the dataset, indicating its relevance to their experiments.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Hansel dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:

- For **Hansel Dataset**:
  > Xu, Z., Shan, Z., Li, Y., Hu, B., Qin, B. (2023). *Hansel: A Chinese Few-Shot and Zero-Shot Entity Linking Benchmark*. In Proceedings of the 2023 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), pp. 832–840. Association for Computing Machinery, New York, NY, USA. https://doi.org/10.1145/3539597.3570418

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the findings:

1. **Dataset Name**: Hansel Dataset
   - **Description**: A benchmark dataset for few-shot and zero-shot entity linking in simplified Chinese, derived from Wikipedia.
   - **Full Citation**: Xu, Z., Shan, Z., Li, Y., Hu, B., Qin, B. (2023). *Hansel: A Chinese Few-Shot and Zero-Shot Entity Linking Benchmark*. In Proceedings of the 2023 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), pp. 832–840. Association for Computing Machinery, New York, NY, USA. https://doi.org/10.1145/3539597.3570418

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
