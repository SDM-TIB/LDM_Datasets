To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Cross Contrasting Feature Perturbation for Domain Generalization" by Chenming Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments on a standard DomainBed benchmark, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention the **DomainBed benchmark**, which includes several datasets for evaluation. I will look for specific datasets listed within this benchmark.

Upon reviewing the experiments, I find that the authors evaluate their method on the following datasets:

1. **Colored MNIST**: A variant of the MNIST dataset consisting of 70,000 examples with 2 classes and colored digits.
2. **Rotated MNIST**: Another variant of MNIST with 70,000 examples, where digits are rotated by various degrees.
3. **PACS**: A dataset that includes domains corresponding to different artistic styles (art, cartoons, photos, sketches) with 9,991 examples and 7 classes.
4. **VLCS**: This dataset includes domains from Caltech101, LabelMe, SUN09, and VOC2007, totaling 10,729 examples and 5 classes.
5. **Office-Home**: A dataset with 15,588 examples across four domains (art, clipart, product, real) and 65 classes.
6. **Terra Incognita**: Contains photographs of wild animals taken by camera traps, with 24,788 examples and 10 classes.
7. **DomainNet**: A large dataset with 586,575 examples across six domains (clipart, infograph, painting, quickdraw, real, sketch) and 345 classes.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their full citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
