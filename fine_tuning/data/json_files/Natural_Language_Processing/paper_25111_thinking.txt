To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Systematic Evaluation of Neural Retrieval Models on the Touché 2020 Argument Retrieval Subset of BEIR" by Nandan Thakur et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study focuses on the Touché 2020 dataset, which is a subset of the BEIR benchmark for argument retrieval. This suggests that the Touché 2020 dataset is a primary dataset of interest.

Next, I will look into the **experimental setup** section, specifically where the authors describe the Touché 2020 dataset in detail. Here, they mention that the dataset consists of a focused crawl of arguments for 49 test queries and includes a document collection from the args.me corpus, which contains 382,545 arguments. Each argument has a title and a context, along with relevance judgments for 2,214 documents.

In the **results** and **discussion** sections, the authors discuss the implications of their findings on the Touché 2020 dataset and how they denoised the data to improve retrieval effectiveness. They also mention that their code and the augmented Touché 2020 dataset are available on GitHub, which is crucial for citation purposes.

Now, I will compile the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. **Touché 2020 Dataset**: 
   - The citation for the Touché 2020 dataset is:
     > Alexander Bondarenko, Maik Fröbe, Meriem Beloucif, Lukas Gienapp, Yamen Ajjour, Alexander Panchenko, Chris Biemann, Benno Stein, Henning Wachsmuth, Martin Potthast, and Matthias Hagen. *Overview of Touché 2020: Argument Retrieval*. In Proceedings of the 11th International Conference of the CLEF Association, CLEF 2020, pages 384–395, 2020. https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-58219-7_26

2. **args.me Corpus**: 
   - The citation for the args.me corpus, which is part of the Touché 2020 dataset, is:
     > Yamen Ajjour, Henning Wachsmuth, Johannes Kiesel, Martin Potthast, Matthias Hagen, and Benno Stein. *Data Acquisition for Argument Search: The args.me Corpus*. In Proceedings of the 42nd German Conference on AI, KI 2019, pages 48–59, 2019. https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-30179-8_4

After gathering this information, I will ensure that I have accurately documented the datasets and their citations for further processing or review. This structured approach will help in maintaining clarity and accuracy in the dataset extraction process.
