To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Leveraging Large Language Models to Extract Information on Substance Use Disorder Severity from Clinical Notes: A Zero-shot Learning Approach" by Maria Mahbub et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on extracting information related to substance use disorder (SUD) severity from clinical notes, which suggests that there may be a dataset involved.

Next, I will examine the **methods section**, specifically the part where the authors describe their dataset. Here, they mention using a random set of **577 fully identified clinical notes** curated from the **United States Department of Veterans Affairs Corporate Data Warehouse (VA CDW)**. This is a clear indication of a dataset being utilized in their study.

In the methods section, they also provide details about how the dataset was selected, including the criteria based on ICD-10 codes and the types of clinical notes included. This information is crucial for understanding the dataset's context and relevance.

Now, I will look for the **full citation** of the dataset mentioned in the references section. Since the dataset is derived from the VA CDW, I will note that it may not have a formal citation like a published dataset but rather a reference to the organization that maintains it.

The citation for the dataset can be summarized as follows:
- **United States Department of Veterans Affairs Corporate Data Warehouse (VA CDW)**: This dataset consists of clinical notes used for extracting SUD severity information.

Since the dataset is not formally published in a paper, I will ensure to mention it as a resource from the VA CDW in my final output.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring to include the relevant details and the citation for the dataset as described above. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the dataset used in the study.
