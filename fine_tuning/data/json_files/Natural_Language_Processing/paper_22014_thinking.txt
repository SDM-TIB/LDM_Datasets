To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Compressed Deepfake Video Detection Based on 3D Spatiotemporal Trajectories" by Zongmei Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors validate their method on several compressed Deepfake benchmarks, indicating that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention three datasets:

1. **FaceForensics++ (FF++)**: This dataset is used for training and testing the proposed method. It includes both high-quality (HQ) and low-quality (LQ) compressed videos.

2. **DFDC (Deepfake Detection Challenge)**: This dataset is noted as the largest publicly available Deepfake detection dataset, released by Facebook in 2020.

3. **Celeb-DF**: This dataset is also mentioned, which is a large-scale challenging dataset for Deepfake forensics.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **FaceForensics++**, the citation is:
  > Andreas Rossler, Davide Cozzolino, Luisa Verdoliva, Christian Riess, Justus Thies, and Matthias Nießner. *Faceforensics++: Learning to detect manipulated facial images*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF international conference on computer vision, pages 1–11, 2019.

- For **DFDC**, the citation is:
  > Brian Dolhansky, Joanna Bitton, Ben Pflaum, Jikuo Lu, Russ Howes, Menglin Wang, and Cristian Canton Ferrer. *The deepfake detection challenge (dfdc) dataset*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2006.07397, 2020.

- For **Celeb-DF**, the citation is:
  > Yuezun Li, Xin Yang, Pu Sun, Honggang Qi, and Siwei Lyu. *Celeb-df: A large-scale challenging dataset for deepfake forensics*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pages 3207–3216, 2020.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will allow for a clear understanding of the datasets used in the research and their relevance to the study's findings.
