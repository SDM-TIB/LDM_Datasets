To extract datasets from the research paper titled "TaskFlex Solver for Multi-Agent Pursuit via Automatic Curriculum Learning" by Jiayu Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's focus on multi-agent pursuit problems and mentions the use of reinforcement learning and curriculum learning. However, it does not explicitly mention any datasets. The introduction may provide more context or references to specific datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will look into the **experiments** section, as this is typically where datasets are detailed. In this paper, the authors mention two testbeds for their experiments: the **multi-agent particle-world environment (MPE)** and the **NVIDIA Isaac Sim-based Omnidrones environment (Omni)**. I will need to check if these environments are associated with specific datasets or if they are simulation environments that do not require external datasets.

In the **methodology** section, the authors describe the task pool and the parameters used for the experiments, but they do not provide specific dataset names. Instead, they focus on the configurations of the environments used for testing their algorithm.

I will also check the **references** section to see if any datasets are cited in relation to the environments used. The references may include foundational papers or datasets that are commonly used in multi-agent pursuit research.

After reviewing the paper, I find that the authors do not explicitly mention any datasets by name. Instead, they utilize simulation environments (MPE and Omni) for their experiments. Therefore, I will note that while specific datasets are not provided, the environments themselves serve as the basis for the experiments.

Since there are no datasets to cite, I will summarize the findings as follows:

1. **Multi-Agent Particle-World Environment (MPE)**: A simulation environment used for 2-dimensional pursuit-evasion tasks. No specific dataset citation is provided as it is a simulation framework.

2. **NVIDIA Isaac Sim-based Omnidrones Environment (Omni)**: A simulation environment used for 3-dimensional pursuit-evasion tasks. Again, no specific dataset citation is provided as it is a simulation framework.

In conclusion, while the paper does not provide traditional datasets with citations, it relies on simulation environments for its experiments. I will document this information clearly, emphasizing the nature of the environments used in the study.
