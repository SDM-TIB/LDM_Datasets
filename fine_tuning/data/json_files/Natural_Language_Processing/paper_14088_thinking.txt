To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Benchmarking quantized LLaMa-based models on the Brazilian Secondary School Exam" by Matheus L. O. Santos and Cláudio E. C. Campelo, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and conclusion sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors developed a database containing **1,006 questions from the ENEM (Brazilian National Secondary School Exam)**, which indicates that this is a primary dataset of interest.

Next, I will look closely at the **methodology section**, specifically under the subsection titled **Dataset**. Here, the authors describe the dataset in detail, including its structure and the process used to compile it. They mention that the dataset consists of questions from the ENEM exams covering the years **2010 to 2022**, and it includes the text of the questions along with the correct answers.

The authors also provide information about how the dataset was created, including the collection of ENEM tests in PDF format from the **Instituto Nacional de Estudos e Pesquisas Educacionais Anísio Teixeira (INEP)** and the use of a tool for text extraction. This detailed description confirms the dataset's relevance and utility for evaluating language models.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the ENEM dataset. The authors cite their own work regarding the dataset:

- For the **ENEM Questions Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Matheus L. O. dos Santos and Cláudio E. C. Campelo. *Brazilian Secondary School Exam (ENEM) Questions Dataset*. Aug. 2023.

With this information, I can summarize the dataset as follows:

1. **ENEM Questions Dataset**: A structured database containing 1,006 questions from the Brazilian National Secondary School Exam (ENEM) covering the years 2010 to 2022, including the text of the questions and correct answers.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that the full citation is included for the dataset.
