To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Combining Static and Contextualised Multilingual Embeddings" by Katharina Hämmerl et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract mentions that the authors extract static embeddings for 40 languages from XLM-R, which indicates that there are datasets involved.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section** where the authors describe their process for extracting static embeddings. They mention using the **CC100 corpus** for data sampling, which is a significant dataset for their experiments. I will need to confirm the details of this dataset.

In the **appendices**, particularly Appendix A, the authors provide a list of the 40 languages used for static embeddings extraction. This is important for understanding the scope of the datasets involved.

I will also look for any references to other datasets used for evaluation, such as the **MUSE benchmark** for validating the static embeddings. The authors mention using MUSE for bilingual dictionary induction tasks, which indicates that it is a relevant dataset for their work.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to retrieve full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. **CC100 Corpus**: The citation is:
   > Guillaume Wenzek, Marie-Anne Lachaux, Alexis Conneau, Vishrav Chaudhary, Francisco Guzmán, Armand Joulin, and Edouard Grave. *CCNet: Extracting high quality monolingual datasets from web crawl data*. In Proceedings of the 12th Language Resources and Evaluation Conference, pages 4003–4012, 2020.

2. **MUSE Benchmark**: The citation is:
   > Mikel Artetxe, Sebastian Ruder, and Dani Yogatama. *On the cross-lingual transferability of monolingual representations*. In Proceedings of the 58th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, pages 4623–4637, 2020.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations. This will ensure that all relevant datasets are documented accurately and comprehensively.
