To extract datasets from the research paper titled "That's the Wrong Lung! Evaluating and Improving the Interpretability of Unsupervised Multimodal Encoders for Medical Data" by Denis Jered McInerney et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their methods using multimodal models on Electronic Health Records (EHRs), which suggests that datasets related to medical imaging and reports may be involved.

Next, I will focus on the **Preliminaries section (Section 2)**, where the authors discuss the models and datasets used for evaluation. Here, they mention two specific datasets:

1. **MIMIC-CXR**: This dataset comprises chest X-rays and corresponding radiology reports. It is a well-known dataset in the medical imaging community.

2. **Chest ImaGenome**: This dataset includes 1,000 manually annotated image/report pairs, with bounding boxes for anatomical locations and links between referring sentences and image bounding boxes.

In the **Data and Metrics section (Section 2.3)**, the authors provide further details about these datasets, confirming their use in the evaluation of the models.

Now, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for these datasets:

- For **MIMIC-CXR**, the citation is:
  > Alistair E. W. Johnson, Tom J. Pollard, Seth J. Berkowitz, Nathaniel R. Greenbaum, Matthew P. Lungren, Chih Ying Deng, Roger G. Mark, and Steven Horng. *MIMIC-CXR, a de-identified publicly available database of chest radiographs with free-text reports*. Scientific Data, 6, 2019.

- For **Chest ImaGenome**, the citation is:
  > Joy T. Wu, Nkechinyere N. Agu, Ismini Lourentzou, Arjun Sharma, Joseph Alexander Paguio, Jasper Seth Yao, Edward Christopher Dee, William Mitchell, Satyananda Kashyap, Andrea Giovannini, Leo Anthony Celi, and Mehdi Moradi. *Chest ImaGenome dataset for clinical reasoning*. ArXiv, abs/2108.00316, 2021.

With these citations in hand, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a clear and structured output for further use or analysis.
