To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Tensor formalism for predicting synaptic connections with ensemble modeling or optimization" by Tirthabir Biswas et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** of the paper. The abstract often provides a concise summary of the research, including any datasets used. In the introduction, the authors may discuss previous work that utilized specific datasets, which can give clues about the datasets relevant to their study.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, as it typically details the experimental setup and any datasets used for analysis. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and any specific characteristics that are relevant to the research.

After identifying potential datasets, I will check the **results section** to see if the authors reference any datasets when discussing their findings. This can help confirm the datasets that were actually used in the analysis.

I will also consult the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. I will look for any papers or resources that describe the datasets in detail.

For example, if the authors mention using a dataset like the "Penn Action Dataset," I will ensure to find the full citation, which might look something like this:
> Wenzheng Zhang, Menglong Zhu, and Konstantinos G. Derpanis. *From Actemes to Action: A Strongly-Supervised Representation for Detailed Action Understanding*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 2248â€“2255, 2013.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the datasets into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset entry includes its name, description, and full citation.

Finally, I will review the extracted information to ensure accuracy and completeness before finalizing the dataset entries for further use or sharing.
