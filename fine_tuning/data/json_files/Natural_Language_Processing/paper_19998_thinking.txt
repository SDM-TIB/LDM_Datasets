To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Distribution-Free Guarantees for Systems with Decision-Dependent Noise" by Heling Zhang, Lillian J. Ratliff, and Roy Dong, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses a novel iterative method for systems with decision-dependent noise, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any references to datasets used in the experiments or analyses. The introduction primarily discusses the challenges of noise in dynamical systems and does not mention specific datasets.

I will then check the **methods section**, particularly any subsections that might detail experimental setups or data sources. If the authors conducted experiments, they might have used specific datasets that would be described here. However, the methods section focuses on the theoretical framework and does not provide information about datasets.

After that, I will look at the **results section** to see if the authors report results based on specific datasets. If they mention any datasets in the context of their findings, I will take note of them.

Finally, I will consult the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned throughout the paper. If the authors refer to existing datasets, they will likely provide citations that I can use.

If I find any datasets mentioned, I will ensure to write down their full citations accurately. If no datasets are explicitly mentioned in the paper, I will conclude that this research does not utilize any datasets that need to be cited.

In summary, I will carefully read through the relevant sections of the paper, looking for any explicit mentions of datasets, and gather full citations from the references section if applicable. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important information regarding datasets used in the research.
