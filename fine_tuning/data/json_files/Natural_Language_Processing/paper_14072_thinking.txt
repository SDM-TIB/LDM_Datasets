To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Data-centric Graph Machine Learning: Review and Outlook" by Xin Zheng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a high-level overview of the paper's focus on data-centric AI and graph data, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets.

Next, I will examine the **main body of the paper**, particularly sections that discuss experiments, methodologies, or case studies. I will look for any specific datasets that the authors might have used to illustrate their points or validate their claims. 

In the **framework and taxonomy section**, the authors discuss various aspects of data-centric graph machine learning, but they do not provide specific dataset names. However, they do mention the importance of graph data collection and exploration, which may imply the use of existing datasets.

I will also check the **references section** for any datasets that might be cited indirectly through other works. This section may contain references to foundational datasets used in the field of graph machine learning.

After thoroughly reviewing the paper, I will compile a list of any datasets mentioned, along with their full citations. If no specific datasets are identified, I will note that the paper primarily discusses concepts and frameworks without referencing particular datasets.

Finally, I will ensure that I format the citations correctly, adhering to the citation style used in the paper, and provide a clear summary of each dataset, if applicable.

In summary, my steps will include:
1. Reading the abstract and introduction for any mentions of datasets.
2. Analyzing the main body of the paper for specific datasets used in experiments or discussions.
3. Checking the references for any cited datasets.
4. Compiling a list of datasets with full citations and summaries, if applicable.
5. Documenting the findings clearly for future reference.

By following these steps, I will ensure a comprehensive extraction of any datasets referenced in the paper.
