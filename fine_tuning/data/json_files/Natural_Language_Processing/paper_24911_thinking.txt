To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Optimizing Nepali PDF Extraction: A Comparative Study of Parser and OCR Technologies" by Prabin Paudel et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, results, and conclusion sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on PDF parsing and OCR methods, but it does not mention specific datasets.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any references to datasets used in the research. The introduction discusses the challenges of text extraction for low-resource languages like Nepali but does not specify any datasets.

Moving on to the **methodology section**, I will look for details about the PDFs used in the experiments. The authors mention using **5 different PDFs** for testing the performance of various libraries, but they do not provide specific names or citations for these PDFs. Instead, they describe the types of PDFs (e.g., those with Nepali Unicode characters, Unicode-incompatible fonts, and image-embedded content) but do not list them as formal datasets.

In the **results section**, the authors present tables comparing the performance of different extraction methods on the PDFs, but again, no formal dataset names or citations are provided.

Finally, I will check the **references section** to see if any of the cited works include datasets relevant to the study. However, the references primarily focus on previous studies and tools rather than specific datasets.

Since the paper does not provide any formal datasets with citations, I will conclude that there are no datasets to extract from this research paper. The focus is more on the methodologies and tools used for text extraction rather than on specific datasets.

In summary, I will document that while the paper discusses various PDFs used for testing, it does not provide formal datasets or citations for them. Therefore, there are no dataset entries to create for this research paper.
