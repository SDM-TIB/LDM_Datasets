To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Designing Interpretable ML System to Enhance Trust in Healthcare: A Systematic Review to Proposed Responsible Clinician-AI-Collaboration Framework" by Elham Nasarian et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, results, and conclusion sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's focus, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the research, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will pay particular attention to the **methods section**, as it typically details the datasets used for analysis. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, descriptions, and any relevant characteristics.

In the **results section**, I will check for any additional information about the datasets, such as how they were utilized in the experiments or analyses conducted in the study. This may include performance metrics or comparisons that highlight the datasets' significance.

Finally, I will consult the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned in the paper. This is crucial for ensuring that I have accurate and complete references for each dataset.

As I go through the paper, I will note down the following for each dataset:
1. The name of the dataset.
2. A brief description of the dataset, including its purpose and any relevant characteristics.
3. The full citation for the dataset as provided in the references section.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile it into a structured format for easy reference. This will ensure that I have a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, along with their proper citations.
