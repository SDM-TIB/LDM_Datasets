To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Advancing Beyond Identification: Multi-bit Watermark for Large Language Models via Position Allocation" by KiYoon Yoo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of a specific dataset, which is a good starting point. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or references to datasets in these sections.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4), as this is typically where authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. I will look for any subsections that specifically mention datasets, such as "Datasets" or "Experimental Setup." 

In the experiments section, I will identify any datasets that are explicitly named or described. For example, if the authors mention using the **C4 dataset** for generating sequences, I will note this down. I will also look for any additional datasets mentioned, such as the **Long-form Question-Answering (LFQA)** dataset or the **Wikitext** dataset, which may be referenced in the context of their experiments.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution. I will look for the original papers or sources that describe these datasets in detail.

For example, if the paper mentions the **C4 dataset**, I will find the citation:
> Colin Raffel, Noam Shazeer, Adam Roberts, Katherine Lee, Sharan Narang, Michael Matena, Yanqi Zhou, Wei Li, and Peter J Liu. *Exploring the limits of transfer learning with a unified text-to-text transformer*. The Journal of Machine Learning Research, 21(1):5485â€“5551, 2020.

Similarly, for the **LFQA dataset**, I will find its citation:
> Kalpesh Krishna, Yixiao Song, Marzena Karpinska, John Wieting, and Mohit Iyyer. *Paraphrasing evades detectors of AI-generated text, but retrieval is an effective defense*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2303.13408, 2023.

And for the **Wikitext dataset**, I will find:
> Stephen Merity, Caiming Xiong, James Bradbury, and Richard Socher. *Pointer sentinel mixture models*. 2016.

Once I have gathered all the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference.

This systematic approach ensures that I accurately extract and cite all datasets mentioned in the paper, maintaining the integrity of the research and providing proper attribution to the original sources.
