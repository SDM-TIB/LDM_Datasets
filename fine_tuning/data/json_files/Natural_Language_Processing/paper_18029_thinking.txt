To extract datasets from the research paper titled "REAL3D-PORTRAIT: ONE-SHOT REALISTIC 3D TALKING PORTRAIT SYNTHESIS" by Zhenhui Ye et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental setup section** (section 4.1) where the authors describe the data preparation process. Here, they mention using two specific datasets:

1. **CelebV-HQ**: This dataset is described as a high-fidelity talking face video dataset containing approximately 65 hours of video and 35,666 video clips involving 15,653 identities. This dataset is crucial for training the motion adapter and HTB-SR model.

2. **VoxCeleb2**: This dataset is noted as a low-fidelity but extensive lip-reading dataset, containing around 2,000 hours of audio. It is used to train the audio-to-motion model, ensuring generalizability in the mapping from audio to facial motion.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **CelebV-HQ**, the citation is:
  > Zhu, Z., et al. *CelebV-HQ: A large-scale video facial attributes dataset*. In Proceedings of the European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), 2022.

- For **VoxCeleb2**, the citation is:
  > Chung, J. S., Nagrani, A., & Zisserman, A. *Voxceleb2: Deep speaker recognition*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1806.05622, 2018.

Now that I have the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use.

In summary, the datasets extracted from the paper are:
1. **CelebV-HQ** - A high-fidelity talking face video dataset.
2. **VoxCeleb2** - A large-scale lip-reading dataset.

I will ensure to include the full citations for both datasets as they are critical for proper referencing in any subsequent work.
