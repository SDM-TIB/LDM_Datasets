To extract datasets from the research paper titled "How Good Are Low-bit Quantized LLAMA3 Models? An Empirical Study" by Wei Huang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions evaluating LLAMA3 on "diverse datasets," which indicates that there are multiple datasets involved. The introduction further elaborates on the evaluation of LLAMA3 across various tasks, hinting at the presence of specific datasets.

Next, I will examine the **Empirical Evaluation** section, particularly the subsections that detail the evaluation datasets used for both Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) and LoRA-FineTuning (LoRA-FT) methods. In this section, the authors explicitly list the datasets used for evaluation:

1. **WikiText2**: A dataset commonly used for language modeling tasks.
2. **C4**: A large-scale dataset for various NLP tasks.
3. **PTB (Penn Treebank)**: A dataset used for language modeling and parsing.
4. **CommonSenseQA**: A dataset for evaluating commonsense reasoning in question answering.
5. **PIQA**: A dataset for physical commonsense reasoning.
6. **ARC-e and ARC-c**: Datasets for evaluating question answering capabilities.
7. **HellaSwag**: A dataset for evaluating commonsense reasoning in sentence completion tasks.
8. **Winogrande**: A dataset for evaluating commonsense reasoning in a Winograd schema challenge.
9. **MMLU**: A benchmark for measuring massive multitask language understanding.

I will also check the **References section** to gather full citations for each dataset mentioned. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for each dataset's use in the study.

The citations I will extract include:

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries along with their full citations to ensure that they are ready for structured output or further processing. This systematic approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details regarding the datasets used in the study.
