To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Bilevel Generative Learning for Low-Light Vision" by Yingchi Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experimental evaluations on three representative low-light vision tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved. I will look for specific names of datasets in these sections.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4), as this is where datasets are typically detailed. In section 4.1, the authors explicitly mention three datasets used for their experiments:

1. **SID Dataset**: The authors describe it as containing 2,697 short-exposure images and 231 long-exposure reference images for training, with 598 image pairs for testing.

2. **DARK FACE Dataset**: This dataset includes 5,000 images for training and 1,000 images for testing, specifically in the context of object detection.

3. **ACDC Dataset**: The authors state that they randomly selected 400 pairs of data for training and 106 pairs for testing.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **SID Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Chen Chen, Qifeng Chen, Jia Xu, and Vladlen Koltun. *Learning to see in the dark*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 3291–3300, 2018.

- For the **DARK FACE Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Wenhan Yang, Ye Yuan, Wenqi Ren, Jiaying Liu, Walter J Scheirer, Zhangyang Wang, Taiheng Zhang, Qiaoyong Zhong, Di Xie, Shiliang Pu, et al. *Advancing image understanding in poor visibility environments: A collective benchmark study*. IEEE Transactions on Image Processing, 29:5737–5752, 2020.

- For the **ACDC Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Christos Sakaridis, Dengxin Dai, and Luc Van Gool. *ACDC: The adverse conditions dataset with correspondences for semantic driving scene understanding*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 10765–10775, 2021.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured all necessary details regarding the datasets used in the research.
