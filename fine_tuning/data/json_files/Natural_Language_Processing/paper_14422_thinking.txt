To extract datasets from the research paper titled "No Offense Taken: Eliciting Offensiveness from Language Models" by Anugya Srivastava et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract discusses the generation of a corpus of test cases to elicit offensive responses, which suggests that there may be datasets involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors reference various works that have contributed to the understanding of biases in language models, hinting at the existence of datasets used for testing these biases. I will look for specific dataset names or descriptions in this section.

Next, I will examine the **related work section** where the authors mention several datasets, including:

1. **BOLD**: A dataset of prompts curated for measuring biases in language generation models. The authors reference the work by Dhamala et al. (2021) for this dataset.
2. **AdversarialQA**: Mentioned in the context of generating adversarial examples for testing language models, with a citation to Bartolo et al. (2020).
3. **Wikipedia Toxic Comments**: Used for training a classifier to detect harmful responses, referenced in Xu et al. (2020).
4. **CrowS-pairs**: A dataset for measuring social biases in masked language models, cited from Nangia et al. (2020).

In the **experiments section**, the authors discuss their methodology for generating test cases and the classifiers used, which may also involve datasets that were not explicitly named but are critical for understanding the context of their experiments.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to retrieve full citations for each dataset mentioned:

- For **BOLD**, the citation is:
  > Jwala Dhamala, Tony Sun, Varun Kumar, Satyapriya Krishna, Yada Pruksachatkun, Kai-Wei Chang, and Rahul Gupta. *Bold: Dataset and metrics for measuring biases in open-ended language generation*. In Proceedings of the 2021 ACM Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency, FAccT ’21, page 862–872, New York, NY, USA. Association for Computing Machinery, 2021.

- For **AdversarialQA**, the citation is:
  > Max Bartolo, Alastair Roberts, Johannes Welbl, Sebastian Riedel, and Pontus Stenetorp. *Beat the AI: Investigating Adversarial Human Annotation for Reading Comprehension*. Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics, 8:662–678, 2020.

- For **Wikipedia Toxic Comments**, the citation is:
  > Jing Xu, Da Ju, Margaret Li, Y-Lan Boureau, Jason Weston, and Emily Dinan. *Bot-adversarial dialogue for safe conversational agents*. In Proceedings of the 2021 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, pages 2950–2968, Online. Association for Computational Linguistics, 2021.

- For **CrowS-pairs**, the citation is:
  > Nikita Nangia, Clara Vania, Rasika Bhalerao, and Samuel R. Bowman. *CrowS-pairs: A challenge dataset for measuring social biases in masked language models*. In Proceedings of the 2020 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), pages 1953–1967, Online. Association for Computational Linguistics, 2020.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture the datasets referenced in the paper for further analysis or processing.
