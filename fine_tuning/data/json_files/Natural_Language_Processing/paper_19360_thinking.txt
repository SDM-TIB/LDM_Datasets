To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Stealthy Adversarial Attacks on Stochastic Multi-Armed Bandits" by Zhiwei Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** of the paper to identify any datasets that are mentioned. The abstract often provides a concise overview of the research and may mention datasets used for experiments or evaluations.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 6 in this case) where the authors typically describe the datasets used in their experiments. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, characteristics, and how they were utilized in the study.

If the datasets are not clearly listed in the experiments section, I will check the **related work section** (Section 2) as it may reference datasets used in previous studies that are relevant to the current research. This could provide context or lead to datasets that the authors have built upon.

After identifying the datasets, I will then look at the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial as it provides the necessary attribution and allows others to locate the datasets easily. I will ensure to note the authors, title, publication venue, and year for each dataset.

For example, if I find that the authors used a dataset called the "MAB Dataset" in their experiments, I will look for its citation in the references. If the citation is formatted as follows:
> Author(s). *Title of the Dataset*. Year. URL or DOI if available.

I will record this citation accurately.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is clearly documented for future reference.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I extract all relevant datasets from the paper along with their proper citations.
