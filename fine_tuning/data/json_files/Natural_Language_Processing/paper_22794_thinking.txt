To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Trajectory Volatility for Out-of-Distribution Detection in Mathematical Reasoning" by Yiming Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on "mainstream mathematical reasoning datasets," which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any relevant subsections that might provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used in their experiments. In this paper, the authors mention using the **MultiArith dataset** for in-distribution (ID) tasks and several out-of-distribution (OOD) datasets, including:

1. **MATH Dataset**: This dataset is used for far-shift OOD detection and is described as containing various domains such as algebra, geometry, counting and probability, number theory, and precalculus.

2. **GSM8K Dataset**: This dataset is used for near-shift OOD detection and consists of math word problems.

3. **SVAMP Dataset**: Another near-shift OOD dataset that includes arithmetic reasoning problems.

4. **AddSub Dataset**: This dataset is also used for near-shift OOD detection and consists of arithmetic word problems.

5. **SingleEq Dataset**: This dataset is used for near-shift OOD detection and includes single-equation problems.

6. **SingleOp Dataset**: This dataset is used for near-shift OOD detection and consists of single-operation problems.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

Here are the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
