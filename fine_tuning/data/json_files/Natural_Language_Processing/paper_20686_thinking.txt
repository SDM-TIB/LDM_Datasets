To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "Rumor Detection with A Novel Graph Neural Network Approach" by Tianrui Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their model on two public datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Evaluation)**, particularly **subsection 4.1 (Dataset)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they name the two datasets as **Twitter15** and **Twitter16**. I will take note of the details provided about these datasets, including their characteristics and the context in which they were used.

In subsection 4.1, the authors describe the datasets as follows:
- **Twitter15**: Contains 1,473 source tweets, 47,925 users, and includes labels for true rumors, false rumors, unverified rumors, and non-rumors.
- **Twitter16**: Contains 790 source tweets, 24,047 users, and similarly includes the same labeling structure.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. However, the paper does not provide specific citations for the datasets themselves, as they are publicly available datasets. Therefore, I will reference the original sources of these datasets based on common knowledge in the field.

For the **Twitter15 dataset**, the citation is:
> Ma, Jing, Wei Gao, and Kam-Fai Wong. "Rumor detection on Twitter with tree-structured recursive neural networks." In Proceedings of the Association for Computational Linguistics, 2018.

For the **Twitter16 dataset**, the citation is:
> Ma, Jing, Wei Gao, and Kam-Fai Wong. "Rumor detection on Twitter with tree-structured recursive neural networks." In Proceedings of the Association for Computational Linguistics, 2018.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This includes ensuring that the dataset names, descriptions, and citations are clearly articulated.
