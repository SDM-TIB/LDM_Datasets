To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Predicting from a Different Perspective in Re-Ranking Model for Inductive Knowledge Graph Completion" by Yuki Iwamoto and Ken Kaneiwa, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that the proposed model is evaluated on **three inductive knowledge completion datasets**, which indicates that datasets are indeed involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors discuss various knowledge graphs (KGs) and mention specific datasets like **Freebase** and **Gene Ontology**. However, I need to confirm if these are used in their experiments or just referenced as examples.

In the **experiments section**, the authors explicitly state that they evaluate their model on three datasets: **WN18RR**, **FB15k-237**, and **NELL-995**. This is crucial as it confirms the datasets used for their evaluations.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For **WN18RR**, the citation is:
   > Tim Dettmers, Pasquale Minervini, Pontus Stenetorp, and Sebastian Riedel. *Convolutional 2D Knowledge Graph Embeddings*. In AAAI 2018, pages 1811–1818. AAAI Press. URL https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v32i1.11573.

2. For **FB15k-237**, the citation is:
   > Kristina Toutanova, Danqi Chen, Patrick Pantel, Hoifung Poon, Pallavi Choudhury, and Michael Gamon. *Representing Text for Joint Embedding of Text and Knowledge Bases*. In EMNLP 2015, pages 1499–1509. URL https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/d15-1174.

3. For **NELL-995**, the citation is:
   > Wenhan Xiong, Thien Hoang, and William Yang Wang. *DeepPath: A Reinforcement Learning Method for Knowledge Graph Reasoning*. In EMNLP 2017, pages 564–573. URL https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/d17-1060.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **WN18RR**: A dataset for knowledge graph completion tasks, specifically designed for inductive settings.
2. **FB15k-237**: A subset of the FB15k dataset, tailored for knowledge graph completion and link prediction tasks.
3. **NELL-995**: A dataset used for inductive relation prediction in knowledge graphs.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries with their full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented and properly cited for future reference.
