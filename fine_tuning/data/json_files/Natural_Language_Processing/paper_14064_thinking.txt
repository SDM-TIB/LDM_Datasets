To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Partition-A-Medical-Image: Extracting Multiple Representative Sub-regions for Few-shot Medical Image Segmentation" by Yazhou Zhu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that the proposed method demonstrates improvements on three publicly accessible medical imaging datasets, which indicates that datasets are involved.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this section, the authors explicitly state that they evaluated their method on three datasets: 

1. **CHAOS Dataset**: This dataset is described as an abdominal MRI dataset published in the ISBI 2019 Combined Healthy Abdominal Organ Segmentation Challenge.

2. **SABS Dataset**: This dataset is an abdominal CT dataset from the MICCAI 2015 Multi-Atlas Abdomen Labeling Challenge.

3. **CMR Dataset**: This dataset is a cardiac MRI dataset from the MICCAI 2019 Multi-Sequence Cardiac MRI Segmentation Challenge.

The authors also mention that CHAOS and SABS share the same categories of labels, which include liver, spleen, left kidney, and right kidney, while the CMR dataset has labels for left ventricular myocardium, right ventricle blood pool, and right ventricle.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For the **CHAOS Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Kavur, A. E., Gezer, N. S., Barış, M., Aslan, S., Conze, P.-H., Groza, V., Pham, D. D., Chatterjee, S., Ernst, P., & Özkan, S. (2021). "Chaos challenge-combined (ct-mr) healthy abdominal organ segmentation." *Medical Image Analysis*, 69, 101950.

- For the **SABS Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Landman, B. A., Xu, Z., Iglesias, J. E., Styner, M., Langerak, T., & Klein, A. (2015). "MICCAI multi-atlas labeling beyond the cranial vault–workshop and challenge." In *MICCAI—Workshop Challenge*.

- For the **CMR Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Zhuang, X. (2018). "Multivariate mixture model for myocardial segmentation combining multi-source images." *IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence*, 41(12), 2933-2946.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all details are accurately represented for future reference or processing.
