To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Vivim: a Video Vision Mamba for Medical Video Object Segmentation" by Yijun Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments on thyroid segmentation in ultrasound videos and polyp segmentation in colonoscopy videos, indicating that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors provide detailed information about the datasets used. In this section, they specifically mention two types of datasets:

1. **VTUS Dataset**: This dataset is explicitly described as comprising 100 video sequences, with a total of 9342 frames annotated with pixel-level ground truth by three experts. The dataset is partitioned into training and test sets (70 training videos and 30 test videos).

2. **Polyp Datasets**: The authors mention using four widely used polyp datasets, which include:
   - **Kvasir Dataset**: An image-based dataset for polyp segmentation.
   - **CVC-300 Dataset**: A video-based dataset for polyp segmentation.
   - **CVC-612 Dataset**: Another video-based dataset for polyp segmentation.
   - **ASU-Mayo Dataset**: A video-based dataset for polyp segmentation.

In the **references section**, I will look for the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets mentioned in the paper are as follows:

- For the **VTUS Dataset**, since it is a new dataset introduced by the authors, I will cite it as:
  > Yang, Y., Xing, Z., Huang, C., & Zhu, L. (2023). *Vivim: a Video Vision Mamba for Medical Video Object Segmentation*. In Proceedings of the [Conference Name], [Page Numbers].

- For the **Kvasir Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Jha, D., Smedsrud, P.H., Riegler, M.A., Halvorsen, P., de Lange, T., Johansen, D., & Johansen, H.D. (2020). *Kvasir-seg: A segmented polyp dataset*. In MultiMedia Modeling: 26th International Conference, MMM 2020, Daejeon, South Korea, January 5–8, 2020, Proceedings, Part II 26. pp. 451–462. Springer.

- For the **CVC-300 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Bernal, J., Sánchez, J., & Vilarino, F. (2012). *Towards automatic polyp detection with a polyp appearance model*. Pattern Recognition, 45(9), 3166–3182.

- For the **CVC-612 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Bernal, J., Sánchez, F.J., Fernández-Esparrach, G., Gil, D., Rodríguez, C., & Vilarino, F. (2015). *WM-DOVA maps for accurate polyp highlighting in colonoscopy: Validation vs. saliency maps from physicians*. Computerized Medical Imaging and Graphics, 43, 99–111.

- For the **ASU-Mayo Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Tajbakhsh, N., Gurudu, S.R., & Liang, J. (2015). *Automated polyp detection in colonoscopy videos using shape and context information*. IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging, 35(2), 630–644.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations into a structured format for further processing.
