To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Annotation Errors and NER: A Study with OntoNotes 5.0" by Gabriel Bernier-Colborne and Sowmya Vajjala, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the **OntoNotes 5.0 corpus**, which is a significant dataset for Named Entity Recognition (NER). This indicates that I should focus on this dataset for extraction.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section more closely. The authors discuss the importance of high-quality annotated corpora for NLP tasks and specifically mention the **OntoNotes 5.0** dataset as the largest available NER corpus for English. This reinforces the significance of this dataset in their research.

In the **methods section**, the authors provide detailed information about the OntoNotes 5.0 dataset, including its size (3,637 documents and 2 million tokens) and the types of annotations it includes (18 named entity types). This section confirms that OntoNotes 5.0 is the primary dataset used in their study.

I will then check the **references section** to find the full citation for the OntoNotes 5.0 dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:
> Weischedel, R., Pradhan, S., Ramshaw, L., Kaufman, J., Franchini, M., El-Bachouti, M., Belvin, R., and Houston, A. (2013). OntoNotes release 5.0. LDC2013T19, Philadelphia, Penn.: Linguistic Data Consortium.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the findings:

1. **Dataset Name**: OntoNotes 5.0
   - **Description**: A large dataset comprising multi-genre text in English, Arabic, and Chinese, with linguistic annotations covering multiple layers such as part of speech, parse structure, co-reference, proposition, word sense, and NER. The English NER portion consists of 3,637 documents and 2 million tokens, annotated with 18 named entity types.
   - **Full Citation**: Weischedel, R., Pradhan, S., Ramshaw, L., Kaufman, J., Franchini, M., El-Bachouti, M., Belvin, R., and Houston, A. (2013). OntoNotes release 5.0. LDC2013T19, Philadelphia, Penn.: Linguistic Data Consortium.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that the dataset's citation is accurately represented.
