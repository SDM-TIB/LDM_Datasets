To extract datasets from the research paper titled "TABLET: Learning From Instructions For Tabular Data" by Dylan Slack and Sameer Singh, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to gather initial information about the datasets. The abstract mentions that TABLET is a benchmark of **20 diverse tabular datasets** annotated with instructions, which indicates that multiple datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors describe the purpose of TABLET and the types of datasets included. They specifically mention that the benchmark consists of **10 datasets from the UCI ML repository** and **10 differential diagnosis (DDX) datasets** for diseases. This gives me a clear indication that I need to look for specific names of these datasets.

In the **appendix**, the authors provide a detailed list of the datasets used in TABLET. I will extract the names of the datasets from this section, which includes:

1. **UCI Datasets**:
   - Adult
   - Abalone
   - Breast Cancer
   - Churn
   - Credit
   - Soybean
   - Wine
   - UEFA
   - Sharktank

2. **DDX Datasets**:
   - Whooping Cough (A37)
   - Ebola (A98.4)
   - Chagas (B57)
   - Guillain-BarrÃ© (G61.0)
   - Myocarditis (I51.4)
   - Pulmonary Embolism (I26)
   - Viral Pharyngitis (J02.9)
   - Epiglottitis (J05.1)
   - Bronchiectasis (J47)
   - Boerhaave (K22.3)

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The UCI datasets are commonly referenced, and I can find their citations in the paper by Dua and Graff (2017). The DDX datasets are referenced from Tchango et al. (2022).

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the UCI datasets:
  > Dheeru Dua and Casey Graff. *UCI Machine Learning Repository*. 2017.

- For the DDX datasets:
  > Arsene Fansi Tchango, Rishab Goel, Zhi Wen, Julien Martel, and Joumana Ghosn. *DDXPlus: A new dataset for automatic medical diagnosis*. In Proceedings of the Thirty-sixth Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems Datasets and Benchmarks Track, 2022.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the dataset names along with their respective citations, ready for structured output or further processing.
