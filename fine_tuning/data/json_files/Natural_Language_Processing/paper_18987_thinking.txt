To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The Application of ChatGPT in Responding to Questions Related to the Boston Bowel Preparation Scale" by Xiaoqiang Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study involves a retrospective collection of **233 colonoscopy images**, which suggests that this is a dataset of interest.

Next, I will focus on the **Materials and Methods section**, where the authors describe the dataset in detail. They mention that the images were collected from 2020 to 2023 and categorized based on the Boston Bowel Preparation Scale (BBPS) levels. The paper states that **252 colonoscopy images** were initially collected, but after screening, **233 images** were selected for testing, and **12 images** were used for fine-tuning ChatGPT.

In the **Results section**, the authors discuss the performance of ChatGPT and the endoscopists in scoring these images, confirming that the **233 colonoscopy images** are indeed the primary dataset used for evaluation.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets or related works mentioned. However, since the dataset consists of images collected for this specific study, it may not have a formal citation like publicly available datasets. Instead, I will note the details provided in the paper.

The dataset can be summarized as follows:

1. **Colonoscopy Image Dataset**: This dataset consists of **233 colonoscopy images** categorized into four BBPS levels (0, 1, 2, 3). The images were sourced from two equipment suppliers: PENTAX Corporation and Olympus Corporation. The dataset was used to evaluate the performance of ChatGPT in scoring bowel preparation.

Since this dataset is unique to the study and does not have a separate citation, I will reference the paper itself as the source of the dataset.

The citation for the paper is:

[Journal Name], [Volume(Issue)], [Page Range], [Year].

Now, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
