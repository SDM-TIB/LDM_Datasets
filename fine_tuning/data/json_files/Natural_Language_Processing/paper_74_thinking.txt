To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Modeling Target-Side Inﬂection in Neural Machine Translation" by Aleˇs Tamchyna et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract discusses improvements in translation for English-Czech and English-German scenarios, which suggests that datasets related to these languages may be involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for training and evaluation. In this paper, the authors mention using the **IWSLT training and test sets** for the English-Czech translation experiments. This is a clear indication that a dataset is being utilized.

I will also look for any specific details about the datasets, such as their size, content, and any preprocessing steps mentioned. The authors provide statistics about the training and test sets, including the number of sentences and tokens, which helps in understanding the dataset's scope.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the IWSLT datasets. The citation for the IWSLT datasets is as follows:
- For the IWSLT datasets:
  > Mauro Cettolo, Christian Girardi, and Marcello Federico. *WIT3: Web Inventory of Transcribed and Translated Talks*. In Proceedings of the 16th Conference of the European Association for Machine Translation (EAMT), pages 261–268, 2012.

Additionally, the authors mention using the **CzEng 1.0 parallel corpus** for the English-Czech experiments. I will also look for its citation:
- For the CzEng 1.0 corpus:
  > Ondˇrej Bojar, Zdenˇek ˇZabokrtsk´y, Ondˇrej Duˇsek, Petra Galuˇsˇc´akov´a, Martin Majliˇs, David Mareˇcek, Jiˇr´ı Marˇs´ık, Michal Nov´ak, Martin Popel, and Aleˇs Tamchyna. *The Joy of Parallelism with CzEng 1.0*. In Proc. of LREC, ELRA, pages 3921–3928, 2012.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant datasets from the paper while adhering to the importance of proper citation.
