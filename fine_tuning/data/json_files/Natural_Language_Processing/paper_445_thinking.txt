To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Out-of-Vocabulary Embedding Imputation with Grounded Language Information by Graph Convolutional Networks" by Ziyi Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract highlights the evaluation of the proposed method on various tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the out-of-vocabulary (OOV) word problem and mention that they propose a method to address this issue. However, they do not explicitly name any datasets in this section.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4), where the authors describe the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they mention two specific datasets:

1. **Card-660 Dataset**: This dataset is described as a word-word similarity task with 660 example pairs involving uncommon words. It serves as a benchmark for rare word representation models and has a high inter-annotator agreement (IAA) measure of 0.90.

2. **Stanford Rare Word (RW) Similarity Benchmark**: This dataset includes 2034 word pairs and tests the ability of representation learning methods to capture the semantics of infrequent words. The authors note that this benchmark has been well-studied in previous literature.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper:

- For the **Card-660 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Mohammad Taher Pilehvar, Dimitri Kartsaklis, Victor Prokhorov, and Nigel Collier. *Card-660: Cambridge Rare Word Dataset – a reliable benchmark for infrequent word representation models*. In Proceedings of the 2018 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, Brussels, Belgium.

- For the **Stanford Rare Word (RW) Similarity Benchmark**, the citation is:
  > Thang Luong, Richard Socher, and Christopher Manning. *Better word representations with recursive neural networks for morphology*. In Proceedings of the Seventeenth Conference on Computational Natural Language Learning, pages 104–113. Association for Computational Linguistics, 2013.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their full citations, I will prepare to compile this information into the required format for further processing or review. This includes ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its citation for proper attribution.
