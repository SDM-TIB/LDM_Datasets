To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Flex Tape Can’t Fix That: Bias and Misinformation in Edited Language Models" by Karina Halevy et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract introduces a novel benchmark dataset called **SEESAW-CF**, which is explicitly stated as being used for measuring bias-related harms of model editing. This is a clear indication that I need to focus on this dataset.

Next, I will look for detailed descriptions in the **methodology section**. In section 3, the authors provide a comprehensive overview of the **SEESAW-CF dataset**, including its structure and purpose. They mention that SEESAW-CF consists of 3,516 examples designed to facilitate the detection of bias-related pitfalls in model editing methods. This section also outlines the types of cases included in the dataset, such as single-property and cross-property cases, which further confirms the dataset's significance.

I will also check the **results and discussion sections** to see if the authors reference any other datasets or provide additional context about SEESAW-CF. However, it appears that SEESAW-CF is the primary dataset discussed throughout the paper.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citation for the SEESAW-CF dataset. The authors do not provide a separate citation for SEESAW-CF, as it is a novel dataset introduced in this paper. Therefore, I will cite the paper itself as the source of the dataset.

The citation for the dataset will be:
> Halevy, K., Sotnikova, A., AlKhamissi, B., Montariol, S., & Bosselut, A. (2023). *Flex Tape Can’t Fix That: Bias and Misinformation in Edited Language Models*. In Proceedings of the [Conference Name], [Page Numbers]. [Publisher]. [DOI or URL if available].

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and citation. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the dataset extracted from the paper.
