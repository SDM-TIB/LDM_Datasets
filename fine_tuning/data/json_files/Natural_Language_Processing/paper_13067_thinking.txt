To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Bi-Step Grounding Paradigm for Large Language Models in Recommendation Systems" by Keqin Bao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments on two datasets, which indicates that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Experimental Settings)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention:

1. **MovieLens10M**: This dataset is described as a well-known benchmark for movie recommendation, containing 10,682 items and over 10 million interactions.

2. **Amazon Video Games Dataset**: The authors refer to a video games recommendation dataset from Amazon, specifically using its 5-core subset, which contains 17,408 items and 496,315 interactions.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

For the **MovieLens10M dataset**, the citation is:
> F. Maxwell Harper and Joseph A. Konstan. *The MovieLens Datasets: History and Context*. ACM Transactions on Interactive Intelligent Systems, 5(4):1-19, 2015. https://doi.org/10.1145/2827872.

For the **Amazon Video Games dataset**, the citation is:
> Julian McAuley and Jure Leskovec. *From Amateurs to Connoisseurs: Modeling the Evolution of User Expertise through Online Reviews*. In Proceedings of the 23rd International Conference on World Wide Web (WWW), pages 897-908, 2014. https://doi.org/10.1145/2566486.2567982.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets, ensuring to include their names, descriptions, and full citations. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
