To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MambaDFuse: A Mamba-based Dual-phase Model for Multi-modality Image Fusion" by Zhe Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the proposed method achieves promising results in both infrared-visible image fusion and medical image fusion, indicating that datasets related to these tasks are likely discussed.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In **section 4.1 (Setup)**, the authors explicitly list the datasets used for both infrared-visible fusion (IVF) and medical image fusion (MIF). They mention three datasets for IVF: **MSRS**, **RoadScene**, and **M3FD**, and for MIF, they refer to pairs of medical images from the Harvard Medical website, specifically mentioning **MRI-CT**, **MRI-PET**, and **MRI-SPECT** datasets.

I will then gather detailed descriptions of each dataset from the text. For instance, the **MSRS dataset** is described as containing 1083 training pairs and 361 testing pairs, while the **RoadScene dataset** has 151 pairs for testing. The **M3FD dataset** consists of 200 training pairs and 100 testing pairs. For the medical datasets, the authors specify the number of pairs for each type: 48 pairs for **MRI-CT**, 190 pairs for **MRI-PET**, and 81 pairs for **MRI-SPECT**.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The paper cites the following:

6. **MRI-SPECT Dataset**:

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This structured approach will help ensure that I accurately capture all relevant details for downstream processing or review.
