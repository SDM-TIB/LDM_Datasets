To extract datasets from the research paper titled "BiSup: Bidirectional Quantization Error Suppression for Large Language Models" by Minghui Zou et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets used for experiments or evaluations.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 5), as this is typically where authors describe the datasets used for their evaluations. I will look for any tables or figures that summarize the datasets, as well as any text that describes their characteristics.

In this paper, the authors mention using the **WikiText2** dataset for calibration and evaluation. I will note the details provided about this dataset, including its purpose and any specific characteristics mentioned in the text.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the WikiText2 dataset. The citation is crucial for proper attribution and will typically include the authors, title, publication venue, and year.

The citation for the WikiText2 dataset is:
> Stephen Merity, Caiming Xiong, James Bradbury, and Richard Socher. *Pointer Sentinel Mixture Models*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1609.07843, 2016.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset details into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and full citation.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for the WikiText2 dataset, ensuring that it is clear and concise, ready for any further processing or review.
