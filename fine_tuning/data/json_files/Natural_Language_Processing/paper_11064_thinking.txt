To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Conditional Normalizing Flow for Accelerated Multi-Coil MR Imaging" by Jeffrey Wen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and method sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors used **fastMRI brain and knee data**, which suggests that these datasets are crucial for the experiments.

Next, I will focus on **section 3.2 (Data)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used:

1. **fastMRI Knee Dataset**: The authors mention using the non-fat-suppressed subset, which includes 17,286 training images and 3,592 validation images. They describe the preprocessing steps, including the creation of complex-valued virtual coils and the use of a specific sampling mask.

2. **fastMRI Brain Dataset**: This dataset consists of T2-weighted images, with the authors using the first 8 slices of all volumes that have at least 8 coils. They report having 12,224 training images and 3,352 validation images, along with similar preprocessing steps as the knee dataset.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The fastMRI datasets are cited as follows:

- For the **fastMRI dataset**, the citation is:
  > Zbontar, J., Knoll, F., Sriram, A., Muckley, M. J., Bruno, M., Defazio, A., Parente, M., Geras, K. J., Katsnelson, J., Chandarana, H., Zhang, Z., Drozdzal, M., Romero, A., Rabbat, M., Vincent, P., Pinkerton, J., Wang, D., Yakubova, N., Owens, E., Zitnick, C. L., Recht, M. P., Sodickson, D. K., and Lui, Y. W. *fastMRI: An open dataset and benchmarks for accelerated MRI*. arXiv:1811.08839, 2018.

With this information, I can now summarize the datasets in a structured manner, ensuring that I include the full citations as required. This will provide a clear overview of the datasets used in the research and their respective references.
