To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Interpreting the Value of Flexibility in AC Security-Constrained Transmission Expansion Planning via a Cooperative Game Framework" by Andrey Churkin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's objectives and may hint at the datasets used for analysis.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly any subsections that discuss the case studies or simulations performed. This section is likely to contain specific references to datasets used in the experiments, such as the "5-bus system" and the "30-bus UK electricity transmission system." I will take note of any details provided about these datasets, including their characteristics and the context in which they were used.

In the **results and discussion section**, I will look for any additional datasets that may be referenced in the context of the findings. The authors may discuss the datasets in relation to their results, which could provide further insights into their significance.

I will also check the **references section** for any citations related to the datasets. This is crucial for obtaining full citations, as the datasets may have been introduced or described in other works. For example, the paper mentions a dataset related to the UK electricity transmission system, which is cited as:
> E. Martinez-Ceseña and W. Kong, “Simplified electricity transmission system from UK (2020) - ATTEST project data set,” 2022. [Online]. Available: https://doi.org/10.25747/z85s-se29

Additionally, I will look for any other datasets mentioned in the references that may not have been explicitly detailed in the main text but are relevant to the study.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the datasets into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as they are critical for proper attribution and further research.

Finally, I will summarize the findings in a clear and concise manner, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its corresponding citation.
