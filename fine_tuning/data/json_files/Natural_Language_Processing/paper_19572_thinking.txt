To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Social Convos: Capturing Agendas and Emotions on Social Media" by Ankita Bhaumik et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the analysis of social media message traffic, which suggests that datasets are involved, but I need to find specific names and details.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of analyzing social media traffic and the need for specific interactions, which indicates that they likely used datasets to conduct their analysis. 

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly **section 3.1 (Dataset)**, where the authors explicitly mention the dataset used for their experiments. They state that they ran their experiments on a publicly available dataset from the 2022 French presidential elections, which contains 45 million tweets and retweets from November 12, 2021, to April 3, 2022. This dataset is crucial for their analysis of influence operations during the election.

The full citation for this dataset is:
> Jean-Michel Daignan. 2022. French presidential election 2022.

Additionally, I will check the **references section** for any other datasets that might be mentioned. However, the primary dataset discussed in the paper appears to be the one from the 2022 French presidential elections.

Now, I will summarize the findings regarding the dataset:

1. **2022 French Election Twitter Dataset**: This dataset contains 45 million tweets and retweets related to the French presidential elections, making it suitable for analyzing influence operations. 

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry with the full citation into a structured format for clarity and future reference.
