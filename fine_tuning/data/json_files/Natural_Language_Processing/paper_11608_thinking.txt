To extract datasets from the research paper titled "No Wrong Turns: The Simple Geometry Of Neural Networks Optimization Paths" by Charles Guille-Escuret et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the research, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments** or **methodology** sections. In this paper, the authors describe their experiments on various tasks, which typically involve specific datasets. I will pay close attention to any tables or figures that summarize the datasets used.

In the **experimental section**, the authors mention four datasets:
1. **CIFAR-10**: A widely used dataset for image classification tasks, consisting of 60,000 color images across 10 classes.
2. **ImageNet-1K**: A large-scale dataset with approximately 1.28 million images across 1,000 categories, commonly used for image recognition.
3. **WikiText-2**: A dataset for language modeling, containing over 2 million tokens from Wikipedia articles.
4. **Vaihingen**: A remote sensing dataset used for segmentation tasks, consisting of aerial images of the city of Vaihingen in Germany.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to guide readers to the original sources.

The full citations I will extract are:
- For **CIFAR-10**:
  > Krizhevsky, A. (2012). *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. URL: http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html.

- For **ImageNet-1K**:
  > Deng, J., Dong, W., Socher, R., Li, L.-J., Li, K., & Fei-Fei, L. (2009). *Imagenet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In 2009 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 248â€“255. doi: 10.1109/CVPR.2009.5206848.

- For **WikiText-2**:
  > Merity, S., Xiong, C., Bradbury, J., & Socher, R. (2016). *Pointer sentinel mixture models*. URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.07843.

- For **Vaihingen**:
  > Rottensteiner, F., Sohn, G., Jung, J., Gerke, M., Baillard, C., Benitez, S., & Breitkopf, U. (2012). *The ISPRS benchmark on urban object classification and 3D building reconstruction*. ISPRS Annals of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences, 2012.

After gathering all this information, I will summarize the datasets, including their descriptions and citations, ensuring that I maintain clarity and accuracy in the representation of each dataset's significance and source.
