To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Evaluating General-Purpose AI with Psychometrics" by Xiting Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any references to datasets. The abstract discusses the evaluation of AI systems but does not explicitly mention datasets. I will move on to the introduction, where the authors emphasize the need for rigorous evaluation methodologies, but again, no specific datasets are mentioned.

Next, I will examine the **methodology and results sections** for any references to datasets used in their evaluations. If the paper includes a section dedicated to datasets, I will focus on that to gather detailed information. 

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors reference several existing benchmarks and datasets used in their evaluations. Specifically, they mention:

1. **BIG-Bench**: A collection of over 200 tasks designed for evaluating AI systems. This dataset is crucial for understanding the performance of general-purpose AI across various tasks.

2. **Cognitive Tasks Dataset**: This dataset is used to assess the cognitive abilities of AI systems, providing a structured way to evaluate their performance on tasks that require reasoning and comprehension.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **BIG-Bench**, the citation is:
  > Srivastava, A., Rastogi, A., Rao, A. A. M., Shoeb, A., Abid, A., Fisch, A. R., Brown, A., Santoro, A., Gupta, A., Garriga-Alonso, A., et al. "Beyond the imitation game: Quantifying and extrapolating the capabilities of language models." *Transactions on Machine Learning Research*, 2023.

- For the **Cognitive Tasks Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Burnell, R., Hao, H., Conway, A. R. A., & Orallo, J. H. "Revealing the structure of language model capabilities." *arXiv preprint arXiv:2306.10062*, 2023.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I accurately capture all relevant datasets from the paper.
