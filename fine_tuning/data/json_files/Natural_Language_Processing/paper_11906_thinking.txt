To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Line Spectrum Estimation and Detection with Few-bit ADCs: Theoretical Analysis and Generalized NOMP Algorithm" by Jiang Zhu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of real data acquired by mmWave radar, which suggests that there may be a specific dataset referenced.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** to find detailed descriptions of the datasets used. This section typically provides insights into the datasets employed for validation and testing of the proposed methods. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

In the **experiments section**, the authors mention using "real data acquired by mmWave radar" but do not specify a dataset name. I will check the **references section** to see if there are any citations that might refer to datasets used in previous studies or any datasets that the authors have utilized in their experiments.

Upon reviewing the references, I find that the paper cites a previous work that may contain relevant datasets. The citation is:
- Xu, M., Zhu, J., Fang, J., Zhang, N., & Xu, Z. (2023). *CFAR based NOMP for line spectral estimation and detection*. IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems, 59(5), 6971-6990.

This citation indicates that the authors may have used datasets from this previous work, which could be relevant for their current experiments.

Now, I will compile the information I have gathered about the datasets into a structured format, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset mentioned or referenced in the paper.

1. **Real Data from mmWave Radar**: While the paper does not provide a specific name for this dataset, it is crucial to note that it is referenced in the context of validating the proposed algorithm.

2. **Referenced Dataset**: 
   - Xu, M., Zhu, J., Fang, J., Zhang, N., & Xu, Z. (2023). *CFAR based NOMP for line spectral estimation and detection*. IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems, 59(5), 6971-6990.

In summary, I will ensure that I accurately document the datasets mentioned in the paper, including any relevant citations, to maintain the integrity of the research and provide proper attribution.
