To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Internal Learning: Deep Learning from a Single Input" by Tom Tirer et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses deep learning techniques that adapt to single inputs, but it does not specify any datasets at this point.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any references to datasets. The introduction emphasizes the challenges of training deep neural networks (DNNs) with limited data but does not mention specific datasets.

I will then look into the **experiments and results sections** to identify any datasets used for evaluation. In this paper, the authors discuss various internal learning techniques and their applications, but they do not provide specific datasets in the text.

After reviewing the entire paper, I will check the **References section** to see if any datasets are cited indirectly through the works referenced. The references include various papers that may have datasets associated with them, but I need to ensure that they are relevant to the current study.

I will compile the relevant datasets and their citations as follows:

1. **Deep Image Prior (DIP)**: The authors reference the original DIP paper, which is foundational for their discussion. The citation is:
   > Ulyanov, D., Vedaldi, A., & Lempitsky, V. (2018). *Deep image prior*. In IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 9446–9454.

2. **Zero-Shot Super-Resolution (ZSSR)**: This method is also referenced, and the citation is:
   > Shocher, A., Cohen, N., & Irani, M. (2018). *“Zero-shot” super-resolution using deep internal learning*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 3118–3126.

3. **SinGAN**: The authors mention this generative model, and the citation is:
   > Shaham, T. R., Dekel, T., & Michaeli, T. (2019). *Singan: Learning a generative model from a single natural image*. In The IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), October.

4. **Image-Adaptive GAN**: This method is discussed in the context of their work, and the citation is:
   > Abu Hussein, S., Tirer, T., & Giryes, R. (2020). *Image-Adaptive GAN based Reconstruction*. AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence.

5. **Double-DIP**: The authors reference this method as well, and the citation is:
   > Gandelsman, Y., Shocher, A., & Irani, M. (2019). *“Double-DIP”: Unsupervised image decomposition via coupled deep-image-priors*. In The IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR).

After gathering this information, I will ensure that each dataset is accurately documented with its full citation for clarity and future reference. This structured approach will help in compiling a comprehensive list of datasets used or referenced in the paper.
