To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Reformulating NLP tasks to Capture Longitudinal Manifestation of Language Disorders in People with Dementia" by Dimitris Gkoumas et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors utilize two datasets: **DementiaBank** and **ADReSS**. This is a good starting point for my extraction.

Next, I will examine the **Methods** section, particularly the **Data** subsection, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention that both datasets contain transcribed speech from individuals with dementia and healthy controls, specifically in the context of the Cookie Theft Picture description task.

1. **DementiaBank**: The authors describe this dataset as having been gathered longitudinally between 1983 and 1988, including 282 subjects (101 healthy controls and 181 Alzheimer's disease subjects). The dataset is referenced in the paper as:
   > Becker, J. T., Boiler, F., Lopez, O. L., Saxton, J., & McGonigle, K. L. (1994). The natural history of Alzheimer’s disease: description of study cohort and accuracy of diagnosis. *Archives of Neurology*, 51(6), 585-594.

2. **ADReSS**: This dataset is described as a benchmark of spontaneous speech, containing transcribed speech from 78 non-AD subjects and 78 AD subjects. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Luz, S., Haider, F., de la Fuente, S., Fromm, D., & MacWhinney, B. (2020). Alzheimer’s dementia recognition through spontaneous speech: The ADReSS challenge. *arXiv preprint arXiv:2004.06833*.

After identifying the datasets and their descriptions, I will ensure to note any specific details about their structure, such as the number of subjects and the nature of the data collected (e.g., longitudinal vs. single-session).

Finally, I will compile the extracted information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly defined and accompanied by its full citation. This will facilitate further analysis or integration into other systems that may require this data.
