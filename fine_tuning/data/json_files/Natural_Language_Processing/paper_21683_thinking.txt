To extract datasets from the research paper titled "PROTA: Probabilistic Token Aggregation for Text-Video Retrieval" by Han Fang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the proposed method achieves significant improvements on several datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed used in the research. I will look for specific names of datasets mentioned in these sections.

Next, I will proceed to the **experiments section** (Section 4), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their characteristics and how they were utilized in the experiments.

Upon reviewing Section 4.1 (Datasets), I find the following datasets mentioned:

1. **MSR-VTT**: This dataset contains 10,000 videos, each with 20 captions. The authors report results on the 1k-A split, which consists of 9,000 training videos and 1,000 testing videos.

2. **LSMDC**: This dataset is composed of 118,081 videos collected from 202 movies, with 1,000 videos selected for evaluation.

3. **DiDeMo**: This dataset includes over 10,000 videos and is used for temporal video grounding, with a specific focus on video-paragraph retrieval tasks.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **MSR-VTT**:
  > Jun Xu, Tao Mei, Ting Yao, and Yong Rui. *Msr-vtt: A large video description dataset for bridging video and language*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2016.

- For **LSMDC**:
  > Anna Rohrbach, Atousa Torabi, Marcus Rohrbach, Niket Tandon, Christopher Pal, Hugo Larochelle, Aaron Courville, and Bernt Schiele. *Movie description*. International Journal of Computer Vision, vol. 123, no. 1, pp. 94â€“120, 2017.

- For **DiDeMo**:
  > Lisa Anne Hendricks, Oliver Wang, Eli Shechtman, Josef Sivic, Trevor Darrell, and Bryan Russell. *Localizing moments in video with natural language*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2017.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or processing. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets relevant to the research and provided proper citations for each.
