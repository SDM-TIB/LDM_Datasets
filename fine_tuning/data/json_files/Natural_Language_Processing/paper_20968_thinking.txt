To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Unsupervised Tumor-Aware Distillation for Multi-Modal Brain Image Translation" by Chuan Huang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of multi-modal brain images from MRI scans, which suggests that datasets are involved. I will look for specific dataset names or references throughout these sections.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of obtaining fully paired multi-modal images and the significance of using multi-modal images for clinical diagnosis. They reference the BRATS2020 dataset, which is a strong indication that this dataset is used in their experiments.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** where the authors explicitly state that they conducted all experiments on the **BRATS2020 dataset**. They describe this dataset as providing brain tumor images of four modalities: Flair, T1, T1ce, and T2, and mention that all images have been manually segmented by experienced raters. This section provides detailed information about the dataset's structure and its application in their research.

Now, I will look at the **references section** to find the full citation for the BRATS2020 dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:

- For the **BRATS2020 dataset**:
  > Bakas, S., Akbari, H., Sotiras, A., Bilello, M., Rozycki, M., Kirby, J. S., Freymann, J. B., Farahani, K., & Davatzikos, C. (2017). Advancing the cancer genome atlas glioma MRI collections with expert segmentation labels and radiomic features. *Scientific Data*, 4(1), 1-13. 

After gathering this information, I will summarize the dataset details and citations in a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly identified with its full citation. This will allow for easy reference and verification in future work or discussions.
