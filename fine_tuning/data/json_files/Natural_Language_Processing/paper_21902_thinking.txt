To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ResVR: Joint Rescaling and Viewport Rendering of Omnidirectional Images" by Weiqi Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that extensive experiments were conducted, which suggests that datasets are likely discussed in detail.

In the **introduction**, the authors highlight the importance of omnidirectional images (ODIs) and their applications in virtual and augmented reality. They mention that existing methods focus on improving the quality of equirectangular projection (ERP) images, which indicates that datasets related to ODIs might be referenced.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors specifically mention using the **ODI-SR dataset** and the **SUN360 Panorama dataset** for their experiments. 

1. **ODI-SR Dataset**: This dataset is referenced in the context of training and evaluating their proposed method. It is crucial to find the full citation for this dataset in the references section.

2. **SUN360 Panorama Dataset**: Similarly, this dataset is mentioned as part of the evaluation metrics for their experiments. I will also look for its full citation.

Now, I will check the **References section** of the paper to gather the full citations for both datasets:

- For the **ODI-SR dataset**, the citation is:
  > Xin Deng, Hao Wang, Mai Xu, Yichen Guo, Yuhang Song, and Li Yang. *Lau-net: Latitude adaptive upscaling network for omnidirectional image super-resolution*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 9189–9198, 2021.

- For the **SUN360 Panorama dataset**, the citation is:
  > Falah Jabar, João Ascenso, and Maria Paula Queluz. *Perceptual analysis of perspective projection for viewport rendering in 360° images*. In 2017 IEEE International Symposium on Multimedia (ISM), pages 53–60, 2017.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
