To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning to Beat ByteRL: Exploitability of Collectible Card Game Agents" by Radovan HaluÅ¡ka and Martin Schmid, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the work, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. This is where authors typically describe the data they used for training and evaluation. In this paper, I will pay particular attention to any references to "Legends of Code and Magic" (LOCM) and any datasets associated with it.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention using **matches between instances of ByteRL** as a dataset for their experiments. They state that they collected over **125,000 matches**, which produced approximately **3.5 million state-action pairs**. This dataset is crucial for their behaviour cloning experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. Since the dataset is derived from matches played by the ByteRL agent, I will cite the paper that describes ByteRL, as it is the source of the data used in the experiments.

The citation for the dataset is:
> Wei Xi, Yongxin Zhang, Changnan Xiao, Xuefeng Huang, Shihong Deng, Haowei Liang, Jie Chen, and Peng Sun. *Mastering Strategy Card Game (Legends of Code and Magic) via End-to-End Policy and Optimistic Smooth Fictitious Play*. ArXiv abs/2303.04096, 2023.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including its description and citation, into a structured format for easy reference. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the relevant details about the dataset used in the research.
