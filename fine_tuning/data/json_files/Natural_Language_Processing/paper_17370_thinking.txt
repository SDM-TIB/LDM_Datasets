To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Subject-Oriented Video Captioning" by Yunchuan Ma et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors constructed two subject-oriented video captioning datasets based on existing datasets, which suggests that these datasets are crucial to the research.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Dataset)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the datasets they constructed. Here, they mention two datasets:

1. **Subject-Oriented MSVD (SO-MSVD)**: This dataset is derived from the original MSVD dataset and contains 3,308 subject samples for 1,961 videos, with a total of 72,530 captions. The authors describe the annotation process and the statistics of the dataset.

2. **Subject-Oriented MSRVTT (SO-MSRVTT)**: Similarly, this dataset is based on the MSR-VTT dataset and includes 15,306 subject samples from 6,310 videos, with 35,499 annotated regions across 25,988 frames. The authors also detail the annotation process for this dataset.

To confirm the names and details of these datasets, I will look for any additional mentions in the **experiments** and **conclusion** sections, where the authors discuss the performance of their methods on these datasets.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the original datasets used to create the subject-oriented versions:

- For the **MSVD dataset**, the citation is:
  > David L. Chen and William B. Dolan. *Collecting highly parallel data for paraphrase evaluation*. In ACL, pages 190–200, 2011.

- For the **MSR-VTT dataset**, the citation is:
  > Jun Xu, Tao Mei, Ting Yao, and Yong Rui. *MSR-VTT: A large video description dataset for bridging video and language*. In CVPR, pages 5288–5296, 2016.

Even though the authors created new datasets (SO-MSVD and SO-MSRVTT), the original datasets' citations are essential for proper attribution.

Finally, I will compile the extracted dataset information, including their descriptions and citations, ensuring that I present them clearly and accurately for any further processing or review.
