To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Variational Zero-shot Multispectral Pansharpening" by Xiangyu Rui et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that "extensive experiments on various benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed method can achieve better performance compared with other state-of-the-art methods." This indicates that datasets are used, but I need to find their specific names.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (Section IV) where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention that they conducted experiments on **WorldView-2 (WV2)**, **WorldView-3 (WV3)**, and **QuickBird (QB)** datasets. They provide details about the number of images and the specifications of each dataset, which is crucial for understanding their application in the research.

In the experiments section, the authors specify:
1. **WorldView-2 (WV2)**: Contains 20 sets of images, with HRMS sizes of 256 × 256 × 8.
2. **WorldView-3 (WV3)**: Also contains 20 sets of images, with HRMS sizes of 256 × 256 × 8.
3. **QuickBird (QB)**: Contains 20 sets of images, with HRMS sizes of 256 × 256 × 4.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The authors may not provide specific citations for the datasets themselves, but they often reference the original sources or documentation for these datasets.

For the datasets mentioned, I will look for the following citations:
- For **WorldView-2** and **WorldView-3**, I will refer to the official documentation or publications related to these satellite imagery datasets.
- For **QuickBird**, I will also look for the original source or documentation that describes the dataset.

After gathering the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described accurately and includes the full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.

Finally, I will summarize the findings in a structured format, ready for further processing or review.
