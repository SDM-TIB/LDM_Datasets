To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Implementation of AI Deep Learning Algorithm For Multi-Modal Sentiment Analysis" by Jiazhen Wang, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the paper discusses a multi-modal emotion recognition method, which suggests that datasets related to emotion analysis may be involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental results and analysis** section, particularly looking for any explicit mentions of datasets used for the experiments. In this section, the author lists four groups of English public emotion samples:

1. **MR Dataset**: A double-category table of emotions in English film reviews, including positive and negative emotions.
2. **CR Dataset**: A dataset of user evaluations of different products, categorized into negative and positive emotions.
3. **SST-2 Dataset**: A dataset that divides film reviews into training, validation, and test sets, with emotional categories of negative and positive.
4. **Subj Dataset**: A set of subjective evaluations that includes subjective and objective markers.

I will also check the **references section** to find full citations for these datasets. However, the paper does not provide explicit citations for the datasets mentioned. Therefore, I will need to look up the standard references for these datasets based on common knowledge in the field:

- For the **MR Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Pang, B., & Lee, L. (2005). A sentimental education: Sentiment analysis using subjectivity summarization based on minimum cuts. In Proceedings of the 43rd Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL), pp. 271-278.

- For the **CR Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Hu, M., & Liu, B. (2004). Mining and summarizing customer reviews. In Proceedings of the 10th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, pp. 168-177.

- For the **SST-2 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Socher, R., Perelygin, A., Wu, J., Chuang, J., Manning, C. D., Ng, A. Y., & Potts, C. (2013). Recursive deep models for semantic compositionality over a sentiment treebank. In Proceedings of the 2013 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), pp. 1631-1642.

- For the **Subj Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Pang, B., & Lee, L. (2004). A sentimental education: Sentiment analysis using subjectivity summarization based on minimum cuts. In Proceedings of the 43rd Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL), pp. 271-278.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
