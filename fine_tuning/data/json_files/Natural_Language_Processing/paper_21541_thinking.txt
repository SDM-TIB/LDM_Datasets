To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fast Gradient Computation for Gromov-Wasserstein Distance" by Wei Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to identify any datasets that are explicitly referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will look for mentions of datasets used for validation or experimentation.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. I will look for any specific names of datasets, their characteristics, and how they were utilized in the experiments. 

In this paper, the authors mention conducting experiments on **1D and 2D random distributions**, as well as **time series data** and **image data**. I will note these as datasets used in their experiments. However, I need to ensure that I capture any specific dataset names or references to established datasets.

I will also check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets that are derived from previous works or are well-known in the field. If the authors mention datasets like MNIST or any other established datasets, I will retrieve their full citations from the references.

For example, if the authors refer to the MNIST dataset, I will include the citation:
> Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 2012.

After gathering all relevant information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for easy reference and further processing.
