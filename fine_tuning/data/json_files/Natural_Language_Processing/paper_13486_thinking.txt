To extract datasets from the research paper titled "FPTQ: Fine-Grained Post-Training Quantization for Large Language Models" by Qingyuan Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and method sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions evaluating the proposed method on standard benchmarks, which suggests that datasets will be discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, specifically **subsection 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for validation. Here, they mention several datasets:

1. **LAMBADA**: This dataset is referenced as a benchmark for word prediction requiring a broad discourse context.
2. **MMLU**: This dataset is noted for measuring massive multitask language understanding.
3. **Common Sense QA**: This section includes various tasks such as WinoGrande, PIQA, HellaSwag, and ARCe.

I will then look for the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **LAMBADA**, the citation is:
  > Denis Paperno, Germán Kruszewski, Angeliki Lazaridou, Quan Ngoc Pham, Raffaella Bernardi, Sandro Pezzelle, Marco Baroni, Gemma Boleda, and Raquel Fernández. *The LAMBADA dataset: Word prediction requiring a broad discourse context*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.06031, 2016.

- For **MMLU**, the citation is:
  > Dan Hendrycks, Collin Burns, Steven Basart, Andy Zou, Mantas Mazeika, Dawn Song, and Jacob Steinhardt. *Measuring massive multitask language understanding*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2009.03300, 2020.

- For **Common Sense QA**, the citation is:
  > Alon Talmor, Jonathan Herzig, Nicholas Lourie, and Jonathan Berant. *CommonsenseQA: A question answering challenge targeting commonsense knowledge*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1910.10099, 2019.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
