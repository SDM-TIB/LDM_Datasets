To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Impact of COVID-19 Lockdown Measures on Chinese Startups and Local Government Public Finance: Challenges and Policy Implications" by Xin Sun, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and data and research design sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The introduction provides context about the study's focus on the impact of COVID-19 on startups and local government finances, which suggests that relevant datasets will be discussed.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Data and Research Design)**, where the author outlines the data sources used for the analysis. Here, I will look for specific datasets that are referenced, including their names, descriptions, and any relevant details about their structure or content.

In **3.1.1 (Sample Selection of the Impact of Lockdown on Startups)**, the author mentions using **monthly province-level data from 2020 to 2022**, which includes 1,116 observations of newly registered businesses sourced from the **Wind dataset**. This dataset is crucial for understanding the impact of lockdown measures on startups.

In **3.1.2 (Sample Selection of the Impact of COVID-19 on Local Government Public Finance)**, the author discusses using data from **the Finance Bureau of each city, the National Health Commission of the People’s Republic of China, and the National Bureau of Statistics of China**. This indicates that multiple datasets are being utilized to analyze local government finances.

Additionally, the author references the **Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT)** for the stringency of lockdown measures, which is another important dataset that needs to be documented.

Now, I will compile the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. The citations will be based on the sources referenced in the text:

1. **Wind Dataset**: 
   > Wind Information Co., Ltd. *Wind Financial Terminal*. Accessed [insert access date].

2. **Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker**:
   > Hale, T., Angrist, N., Goldszmidt, R., Kira, B., & Petherick, A. (2021). *A global panel database of pandemic policies (Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker)*. Version 1.4. 

3. **Finance Bureau of each city**: 
   > [Specific citation details may vary based on the actual reports or documents from each city's Finance Bureau. If no specific citation is provided in the paper, I will note that these are local government reports.]

4. **National Health Commission of the People’s Republic of China**:
   > National Health Commission of the People’s Republic of China. *COVID-19 Data Reports*. Accessed [insert access date].

5. **National Bureau of Statistics of China**:
   > National Bureau of Statistics of China. *Statistical Data*. Accessed [insert access date].

After gathering this information, I will ensure that each dataset is clearly described, including its purpose and the specific data it contains, while also ensuring that the full citations are accurately recorded for future reference. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
