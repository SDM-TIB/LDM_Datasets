To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multilingual Translation with Extensible Multilingual Pretraining and Finetuning" by Yuqing Tang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the datasets discussed. The abstract mentions the creation of the **ML50 benchmark**, which suggests that this is a key dataset in the research.

Next, I will look for specific sections that detail the datasets used, particularly focusing on the **Datasets** or **Experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors describe the **ML50 benchmark** in detail, which is a dataset covering 50 languages with publicly available training and evaluation sets. This is a significant dataset for the research.

In the **ML50 Benchmark** section, the authors provide a breakdown of the languages included and the amount of training data available for each language. They categorize the languages based on the amount of training data, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's structure.

I will also check the **References** section to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper cites various sources for the training data, including WMT, IWSLT, and TED, which are important for the ML50 benchmark.

Here are the key datasets I will extract:

1. **ML50 Benchmark**: This dataset includes 50 languages with varying amounts of training data. The authors mention that it consists of 230 million bitext pairs, which is significant for multilingual machine translation research.

2. **WMT (Workshop on Machine Translation)**: This is a well-known dataset used for training and evaluating machine translation systems. The authors reference multiple WMT datasets for different languages.

3. **IWSLT (International Workshop on Spoken Language Translation)**: Another important dataset mentioned in the paper, used for training and evaluation.

4. **TED Talks**: The authors also mention using TED datasets, which are valuable for multilingual translation tasks.

Now, I will compile the full citations for these datasets based on the references provided in the paper:

- For **ML50 Benchmark**, the citation is:
  > Yuqing Tang, Chau Tran, Xian Li, Peng-Jen Chen, Naman Goyal, Vishrav Chaudhary, Jiatao Gu, Angela Fan. *Multilingual Translation with Extensible Multilingual Pretraining and Finetuning*. arXiv preprint arXiv:XXXX.XXXX, 2023.

- For **WMT**, the citation is:
  > Bojar, O., et al. *Findings of the 2019 Conference on Machine Translation (WMT)*. In Proceedings of the Fourth Conference on Machine Translation (WMT), pages 1-14, 2019.

- For **IWSLT**, the citation is:
  > Cettolo, M., et al. *The IWSLT 2017 Evaluation Campaign*. In Proceedings of the International Workshop on Spoken Language Translation, 2017.

- For **TED Talks**, the citation is:
  > Cettolo, M., et al. *The TED Multilingual Dataset*. In Proceedings of the International Workshop on Spoken Language Translation, 2018.

After gathering this information, I will create structured entries for each dataset, ensuring that the citations are included for reference. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
