To extract datasets from the research paper titled "FRAME-LEVEL EMOTIONAL STATE ALIGNMENT METHOD FOR SPEECH EMOTION RECOGNITION" by Qifei Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on the **IEMOCAP** dataset, which is a strong indication that this dataset is central to their research.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. In section 3.1, the authors explicitly state that they used the **IEMOCAP** dataset for their experiments. They describe it as a well-known multi-modal emotion corpus that includes audio, visual, and lexical modalities, but they only utilized the audio modality for their work.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the IEMOCAP dataset. The citation provided in the references is:

- **IEMOCAP Dataset**:
  > Carlos Busso, Murtaza Bulut, Chi-Chun Lee, Abe Kazemzadeh, Emily Mower, Samuel Kim, Jeannette N Chang, Sungbok Lee, and Shrikanth S Narayanan. *IEMOCAP: Interactive Emotional Dyadic Motion Capture Database*. Language Resources and Evaluation, vol. 42, pp. 335â€“359, 2008.

Since the paper primarily focuses on the IEMOCAP dataset, I will ensure to include this dataset in my final output.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entry with the full citation into a structured format that is ready for review or further processing.
