To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Neural Networks for Automatic Speaker Recognition Do Not Learn Supra-Segmental Temporal Features" by Daniel Neururer et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, results, and conclusion sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study and may mention datasets used for experiments. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets, while the methodology section typically details the datasets employed in the experiments.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of understanding how deep neural networks (DNNs) perform in speaker recognition tasks, which may lead to mentions of specific datasets used for training and evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, where the authors describe their experimental setup. Here, they mention using the **TIMIT dataset** for their experiments, which is a well-known corpus for speech recognition tasks. The TIMIT dataset is noted for its controlled acoustic environment and normalized utterances, making it suitable for studying voice recognition performance.

Additionally, the authors reference the **VoxCeleb dataset** in the context of their experiments. VoxCeleb is a large-scale dataset containing utterances from various speakers recorded in real-world conditions, which adds complexity to the speaker recognition tasks.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper:

1. **TIMIT Dataset**:
   > Fisher, W. M. (1986). The DARPA speech recognition research database: specifications and status. In Proceedings of the DARPA Workshop on Speech Recognition (pp. 93-99).

2. **VoxCeleb Dataset**:
   > Nagrani, A., Chung, J. S., & Zisserman, A. (2017). VoxCeleb: a large-scale speaker identification dataset. In Proceedings of Interspeech (pp. 2616-2620).

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their respective citations.
