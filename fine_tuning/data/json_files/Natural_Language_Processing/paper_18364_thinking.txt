To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The Contribution of Islamic Law to Economic Development" by Hans-Bernd Schäfer and Rok Spruk, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract indicates that the authors use population sizes of cities as proxies for economic development, which suggests that there are datasets related to city populations.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Data and Samples)**, where the authors detail the dependent variable and treatment variables. Here, they mention using city population size estimates from various sources, specifically:

1. **Bairoch et al. (1988)** for European cities, which includes population size estimates for 621 cities from 21 countries.
2. **Bosker et al. (2013)** for Middle Eastern cities, which includes population size estimates for 145 cities from 16 countries.

In this section, I will also look for any additional datasets mentioned, such as the number of law schools (madrasas) in Islamic cities, which is constructed from the **Brill Encyclopedia of Islam** and other scholarly literature.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to obtain full citations for each dataset:

- For the **Bairoch et al. (1988)** dataset, the citation is:
  > Bairoch, P., Batou, J., & Pierre, C. (1988). *Population des Villes Européennes de 800 à 1850: Banque de Données et Analyse Sommaire des Résultats*. Geneva: Librairie Droz.

- For the **Bosker et al. (2013)** dataset, the citation is:
  > Bosker, M., Buringh, E., & Van Zanden, J. L. (2013). *From Baghdad to London: Unraveling urban development in Europe, the Middle East, and North Africa, 800–1800*. Review of Economics and Statistics, 95(4), 1418-1437.

Next, I will compile the information about each dataset, including its description, source, and citation, ensuring that I maintain clarity and accuracy in the documentation.

Finally, I will summarize the findings in a structured format, ready for further analysis or presentation.
