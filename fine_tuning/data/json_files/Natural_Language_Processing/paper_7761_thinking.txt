To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MaxMatch-Dropout: Subword Regularization for WordPiece" by Tatsuya Hiraoka, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the author discusses the datasets used for text classification and machine translation tasks. Here, I will look for explicit mentions of datasets, their purposes, and any relevant details about their structure or content.

In **subsection 4.1 (Text Classification)**, the author lists several datasets used for classification tasks in English, Korean, and Japanese. I will note down the names of these datasets and their descriptions:

1. **APG**: Genre prediction on review texts from the Amazon Product Dataset.
2. **APR**: Rating prediction on review texts from the Amazon Product Dataset.
3. **TS**: Sentiment classification for tweets.
4. **QNLI**: A dataset for natural language inference.
5. **QQP**: Quora question pairs dataset.
6. **RTE**: Recognizing textual entailment dataset.
7. **SST-2**: Sentiment analysis dataset from the Stanford Sentiment Treebank.
8. **NLI, STS, YNAT**: Datasets included in the Korean GLUE benchmark.
9. **TR**: A sentiment classification dataset for tweets in Japanese.
10. **WRIME**: A dataset for emotional intensity estimation in Japanese.

In **subsection 4.2 (Machine Translation)**, the author mentions datasets used for translation tasks, specifically from the IWSLT corpora. I will note these datasets as well:

1. **IWSLT14**: A dataset for machine translation tasks.
2. **IWSLT15**: Another dataset for machine translation tasks.
3. **DeEn**: German to English translation dataset.
4. **ViEn**: Vietnamese to English translation dataset.
5. **ZhEn**: Chinese to English translation dataset.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily.

For example, the citation for the Amazon Product Dataset is:
- He, R., & McAuley, J. (2016). *Ups and downs: Modeling the visual evolution of fashion trends with one-class collaborative filtering*. In Proceedings of the 25th International Conference on World Wide Web (WWW), pages 507–517.

For the Quora Question Pairs dataset, the citation is:
- Chen, Z., Zhang, H., Zhao, L., & Zhang, X. (2018). *Quora question pairs*. University of Waterloo, pages 1–7.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information and citations, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for output, ensuring they are clear and ready for any further processing or review.
