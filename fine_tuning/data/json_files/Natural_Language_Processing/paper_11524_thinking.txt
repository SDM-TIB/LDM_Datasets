To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The Cultivated Practices of Text-to-Image Generation" by Jonas Oppenlaender, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and relevant sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a general overview, but I will focus on sections that typically contain detailed information about datasets, such as the **background, methodology, and discussion** sections.

In the **introduction**, the author references several text-to-image generation systems, including Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, and DALL-E 2. However, I need to determine if these systems are associated with specific datasets used for training or evaluation.

Next, I will look for explicit mentions of datasets in the **background** and **discussion sections**. In the background, the author discusses the evolution of text-to-image generation and mentions the **LAION dataset**, which is a significant dataset used for training generative models. The paper states that LAION-5B contains over 5 billion text-image pairs, which is crucial information.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the LAION dataset. The relevant citation is:

- **LAION-5B**: 
  > Schuhmann, C., Beaumont, R., Vencu, R., Gordon, C. W., Wightman, R., Cherti, M., ... Jitsev, J. (2022). LAION-5B: An open large-scale dataset for training next generation image-text models. In Thirty-sixth conference on neural information processing systems datasets and benchmarks track.

Additionally, I will look for any other datasets mentioned throughout the paper. The author discusses the implications of using web-sourced data, which may include datasets like **CommonCrawl**. However, I need to confirm if it is explicitly cited as a dataset used in the context of text-to-image generation.

After reviewing the paper, I will compile the identified datasets along with their full citations. If there are any additional datasets mentioned in the context of prompt engineering or community resources, I will include those as well.

Finally, I will ensure that each dataset entry is clearly documented with its citation, ready for structured output or further analysis.
