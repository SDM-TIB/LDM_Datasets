To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Gazebo Plants: Simulating Plant-Robot Interaction with Cosserat Rods" by Junchen Deng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental results sections** to find any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the development of a plugin for the Gazebo simulation platform, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the need for synthetic data in agricultural robotics but do not specify any datasets. I will continue to the **methodology** section, where they describe the simulation framework and its capabilities. Here, they mention that the plugin allows for the simulation of plant dynamics and robot interactions, but again, no specific datasets are cited.

Next, I will examine the **experimental results** section. This section discusses calibration experiments and comparisons with real-world outcomes, but it primarily focuses on the simulation results rather than specific datasets. 

After thoroughly reviewing these sections, I will check the **references** section to see if any datasets are cited indirectly through the works referenced. The authors mention several studies related to synthetic data and simulation in agriculture, but I need to identify if any of these references correspond to datasets.

Upon reviewing the references, I find the following relevant citations that could be associated with datasets used in agricultural robotics:

1. **Synthetic Data at Scale**: 
   - Citation: J. Klein, R. E. Waller, S. Pirk, W. Pałubicki, M. Tester, and D. Michels. "Synthetic data at scale: A paradigm to efficiently leverage machine learning in agriculture." Available at SSRN 4314564, 2023.

2. **Performance Evaluation of a Harvesting Robot for Sweet Pepper**:
   - Citation: C. W. Bac, J. Hemming, B. van Tuijl, R. Barth, E. Wais, and E. J. van Henten. "Performance evaluation of a harvesting robot for sweet pepper." Journal of Field Robotics, vol. 34, no. 6, pp. 1123–1139, 2017. Available: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/rob.21709

3. **Robotic Harvesting of Fruiting Vegetables**:
   - Citation: R. R. Shamshiri, I. A. Hameed, M. Karkee, and C. Weltzien. "Robotic harvesting of fruiting vegetables: A simulation approach in V-REP, ROS and MATLAB." Proceedings in Automation in Agriculture-Securing Food Supplies for Future Generations, vol. 126, pp. 81–105, 2018.

These references indicate the presence of datasets related to agricultural robotics and harvesting, which may have been utilized in the context of the research presented in the paper.

Now, I will compile the identified datasets along with their full citations for documentation purposes. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the relevant datasets associated with the research paper.
