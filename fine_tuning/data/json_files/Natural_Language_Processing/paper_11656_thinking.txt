To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Neural Algorithmic Reasoning Without Intermediate Supervision" by Gleb Rodionov and Liudmila Prokhorenkova, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the use of the **CLRS Algorithmic Reasoning Benchmark**, which suggests that this benchmark is a dataset relevant to their research.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **Background section**. Here, the authors discuss the **CLRS benchmark** in detail, stating that it covers 30 diverse algorithmic problems and uses graphs to encode data. This indicates that the CLRS benchmark is indeed a dataset used in their experiments.

In the **Experiments section**, I will check if the authors provide additional details about the datasets used. They mention testing their modifications on a subset of algorithms from the **CLRS benchmark**, confirming its use in their experiments.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citation for the CLRS benchmark. The relevant citation is:
> Veličković, P., Ying, R., Padovano, M., Hadsell, R., & Blundell, C. (2022). The CLRS algorithmic reasoning benchmark. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML), pages 22084–22102.

Since the paper primarily focuses on the CLRS benchmark and does not mention any other datasets, I will summarize my findings.

The only dataset extracted from the paper is the **CLRS Algorithmic Reasoning Benchmark**, which is crucial for understanding the context of their experiments and results.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for the CLRS benchmark, ensuring to include the full citation as required.
