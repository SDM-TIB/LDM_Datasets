To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ERNIE-GEN: An Enhanced Multi-Flow Pre-training and Fine-tuning Framework for Natural Language Generation" by Dongling Xiao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract highlights that the authors conducted experiments on various language generation tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (section 4) closely, as this is where datasets are typically detailed. In section 4.2, the authors mention using several datasets for their experiments:

1. **Gigaword Dataset**: This dataset is described as containing 3.8 million articles extracted from the Gigaword corpus. It is used for the task of abstractive summarization.

2. **CNN/DailyMail Dataset**: This dataset consists of 93,000 articles from CNN and 220,000 articles from Daily Mail, also used for summarization tasks.

3. **SQuAD 1.1 Dataset**: This dataset is utilized for the question generation task, specifically for generating questions based on given passages and answers.

4. **Persona-Chat Dataset**: This dataset is used for dialogue response generation in multi-turn conversations.

5. **CoQA Dataset**: This dataset is employed for generative question answering, allowing the model to generate answers based on input questions and conversations.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **Gigaword Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Alexander M. Rush, Sumit Chopra, and Jason Weston. *A neural attention model for abstractive sentence summarization*. In EMNLP, 2015.

- For the **CNN/DailyMail Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Karl Moritz Hermann, Tomas Kocisky, Edward Grefenstette, Lasse Espeholt, Will Kay, Mustafa Suleyman, and Phil Blunsom. *Teaching machines to read and comprehend*. In NIPS, pages 1693–1701, 2015.

- For the **SQuAD Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Pranav Rajpurkar, Jian Zhang, Konstantin Lopyrev, and Percy Liang. *SQuAD: 100,000+ questions for machine comprehension of text*. In EMNLP, pages 2383–2392, 2016.

- For the **Persona-Chat Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Saizheng Zhang, Emily Dinan, Jack Urbanek, Arthur Szlam, Douwe Kiela, and Jason Weston. *Personalizing dialogue agents: I have a dog, do you have pets too?* In ACL, pages 2204–2213, 2018.

- For the **CoQA Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Siva Reddy, Danqi Chen, and Christopher D. Manning. *CoQA: A conversational question answering challenge*. In ACL, pages 249–266, 2019.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured all relevant details from the paper regarding the datasets used in the research.
