To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Cooperative Sensing of Side Lobes Interference for mmWave Blockages Localization and Mapping" by Hiba Dakdouk et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, but I need to look for specific datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will examine **section IV (Numerical Analysis)**, as this section typically contains details about the datasets used for simulations or experiments. Here, the authors describe the network model and the parameters used for their simulations, which may include datasets or data generation methods.

In this section, I find that the authors mention a **network of M base stations (BSs) and K user equipment (UEs)** distributed in a circular environment. However, they do not specify a publicly available dataset but rather describe a simulation setup based on certain parameters. This indicates that the data used in their experiments is likely generated through simulations rather than sourced from existing datasets.

I will also check the **References section** to see if any datasets are cited indirectly through previous works. The authors reference several studies that may have used datasets relevant to their work, but I need to ensure that these references actually point to datasets.

After reviewing the references, I find that the authors cite a previous work by Sana et al. (2023) that discusses sensing of side lobes interference. This may imply that the data or methodology from that work could be relevant, but it does not provide a direct dataset citation.

Since the paper does not explicitly mention any publicly available datasets, I will summarize the findings as follows:

1. **Simulation Data**: The authors generated their own data through simulations based on a defined network model and parameters, rather than using an external dataset.

2. **Cited Works**: The references include works that may have used datasets, but none are explicitly named as datasets in this paper.

Now, I will compile the information regarding the datasets into a structured format, ensuring to include any relevant citations from the references that could be useful for future research.

The final output will include:
- A note that no specific datasets were used, but simulation data was generated.
- References to previous works that may contain relevant datasets or methodologies.

This approach ensures that I accurately capture the essence of the datasets discussed in the paper while providing proper citations for any referenced works.
