To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Systematic Comparison of Contextualized Word Embeddings for Lexical Semantic Change" by Francesco Periti and Nina Tahmasebi, I will follow a structured approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their models across **eight available benchmarks for LSC**, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors discuss the evaluation framework and mention the benchmarks created for different languages. They refer to diachronic corpora and target words, which are likely to be part of the datasets.

In the **evaluation setup section**, the authors explicitly list the benchmarks for eight languages: English (EN), Latin (LA), German (DE), Swedish (SV), Spanish (ES), Russian (RU), Norwegian (NO), and Chinese (ZH). Each benchmark includes a diachronic corpus and a set of target words. This section is crucial as it provides specific details about the datasets used.

I will then look for any **tables or figures** that summarize the datasets. For instance, **Table 6** provides an overview of the benchmarks, including the time periods, diachronic corpus composition, number of targets, and benchmark versions used in the study. This table will help me compile the necessary information about each dataset.

Now, I will extract the datasets along with their full citations from the **References section**. The citations for the datasets are often included in the context of the benchmarks mentioned in the paper. For example, the authors reference various works that describe the datasets used for each language.

Here are the datasets I will extract:

1. **English Benchmark**:
   - Citation: Schlechtweg et al. (2020). *DWUG EN: Diachronic Word Usage Graphs for English*.

2. **Latin Benchmark**:
   - Citation: McGillivray et al. (2021). *DWUG LA: Diachronic Word Usage Graphs for Latin*.

3. **German Benchmark**:
   - Citation: Schlechtweg et al. (2022b). *DWUG DE: Diachronic Word Usage Graphs for German*.

4. **Swedish Benchmark**:
   - Citation: Tahmasebi et al. (2022). *DWUG SV: Diachronic Word Usage Graphs for Swedish*.

5. **Spanish Benchmark**:
   - Citation: Zamora-Reina et al. (2022b). *LSCDiscovery: A Shared Task on Semantic Change Discovery and Detection in Spanish*.

6. **Russian Benchmark**:
   - Citation: Kutuzov and Pivovarova (2021c). *Three-part Diachronic Semantic Change Dataset for Russian*.

7. **Norwegian Benchmark**:
   - Citation: Kutuzov et al. (2022a). *NorDiaChange: Diachronic Semantic Change Dataset for Norwegian*.

8. **Chinese Benchmark**:
   - Citation: Chen et al. (2023a). *ChiWUG: A Graph-based Evaluation Dataset for Chinese Lexical Semantic Change Detection*.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This structured approach will help me ensure that I do not miss any important details and that the citations are complete and correct.
