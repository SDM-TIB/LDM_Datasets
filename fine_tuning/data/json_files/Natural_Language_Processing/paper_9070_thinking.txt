To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Keyword Embeddings for Query Suggestion" by Jorge Gabín et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their models on datasets related to keyword extraction, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for training and evaluation. In this section, they describe two datasets:

1. **Inspec Dataset**: This dataset consists of 2,000 titles and abstracts from scientific journal papers, with keywords assigned by annotators. The authors specify that they will use the uncontrolled keywords created by professional indexers for their experiments.

2. **KP20k Dataset**: This dataset includes 567,830 articles from the computer science domain, sourced from various online digital libraries. The authors note that all keywords from this dataset are used in both training and testing.

To ensure I have the correct citations, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. Here are the full citations for the datasets:

- For the **Inspec Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Hulth, A. (2003). Improved automatic keyword extraction given more linguistic knowledge. In Proceedings of the 2003 conference on Empirical methods in natural language processing (pp. 216–223).

- For the **KP20k Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Meng, R., Zhao, S., Han, S., He, D., Brusilovsky, P., & Chi, Y. (2017). Deep keyphrase generation. In Proceedings of the 55th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers) (pp. 582–592).

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their proper citations.
