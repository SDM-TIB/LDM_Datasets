To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Detection Latencies of Anomaly Detectors: An Overlooked Perspective?" by Tommaso Puccetti and Andrea Ceccarelli, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any mention of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate different error detectors (ED) and intrusion detectors (ID) in two industrial cases, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for any explicit references to datasets. The introduction discusses the importance of measuring detection latency and mentions that the authors apply their approach to two industrial cases, hinting at the datasets used.

Moving on to **section 4 (Experimental Campaign)**, I will focus on **subsection 4.2 (Datasets)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used in their experiments. Here, I find two datasets:

1. **ROSpace Dataset**: This dataset is for intrusion detection and is composed of monitoring data from an embedded cyber-physical system designed to optimize public mobility. It includes 30,247,050 data points, with a mix of attack and normal operation data.

2. **Arancino Dataset**: This dataset is specific for error detection in an Internet of Things setting. It contains 154,000 observations and is structured to capture the behavior of the Arancino device under normal operations and various injected errors.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets:

- For the **ROSpace Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Puccetti, Tommaso, et al. "ROSpace: Intrusion Detection Dataset for a ROS2-Based Cyber-Physical System." Available at: https://figshare.com/s/7937b17067d20f57fee4.

- For the **Arancino Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Zoppi, Tommaso, et al. "Anomaly Detectors for Self-Aware Edge and IoT Devices." 2023 IEEE 23rd International Conference on Software Quality, Reliability, and Security (QRS). IEEE, 2023.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets and their citations in a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly identified along with its full citation. This will facilitate easy reference and further exploration of the datasets by other researchers or practitioners interested in anomaly detection methodologies.
