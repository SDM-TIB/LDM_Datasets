To extract datasets from the paper titled "The Hardware is the Software" by Jérémie Laydevant et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and main sections** of the paper to look for any explicit mentions of datasets. Since this paper appears to be more of an opinion piece rather than a traditional research paper with empirical data, I will pay close attention to any references to datasets that may support the authors' arguments or examples.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the principles of biological intelligence and how they relate to artificial intelligence. They do not mention specific datasets here, but they do reference the need for collaboration between neuroscience and AI, which may imply the use of datasets in related research.

Next, I will examine the **figures and any cited works** throughout the paper. Figures often contain data or references to datasets that are crucial for understanding the authors' points. I will also check the **references section** for any papers that might have datasets associated with them.

Upon reviewing the paper, I notice that the authors cite several works that may contain datasets relevant to their discussion. For example, they reference the work of Sutton on "the bitter lesson" and Hooker on "the hardware lottery." I will need to look up these references to see if they include datasets.

Now, I will compile the full citations for any datasets I find. If the authors do not explicitly mention datasets, I will focus on the references that are likely to contain datasets related to the themes discussed in the paper.

1. **Sutton, R. (2019)**. The bitter lesson. Retrieved from http://www.incompleteideas.net/IncIdeas/BitterLesson.html
   - This reference discusses the influence of hardware on AI development, which may lead to datasets used in AI research.

2. **Hooker, S. (2021)**. The hardware lottery. Commun. ACM, 64, 58–65.
   - This paper may contain datasets related to the performance of AI systems on various hardware.

3. **LeCun, Y., Bengio, Y., & Hinton, G. (2015)**. Deep learning. Nature, 521, 436.
   - This foundational paper on deep learning may reference datasets used in the development of neural networks.

4. **Brown, T. et al. (2020)**. Language models are few-shot learners. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, Vol. 33, pp. 1877–1901.
   - This paper discusses large language models and may include datasets used for training and evaluation.

After gathering this information, I will ensure that I have the correct citations for each dataset and their associated papers. If the paper does not provide specific datasets, I will note that the authors discuss concepts and principles rather than empirical datasets.

Finally, I will summarize the findings and prepare to present the dataset citations in a structured format for further use or analysis.
