To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Pushing the Limits of ChatGPT on NLP Tasks" by Xiaofei Sun et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on **21 datasets of 10 representative NLP tasks**, which suggests that multiple datasets will be detailed in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, where the authors describe the tasks and the datasets used for each task. I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the subsections dedicated to each NLP task. 

1. **Question Answering**: The authors mention three datasets:
   - **SQuAD V2.0**: A collection of 100K crowdsourced question-answer pairs from Wikipedia articles.
