To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Estimating the Potential Impact of Combined Race and Ethnicity Reporting on Long-Term Earnings Statistics" by Kevin L. McKinney and John M. Abowd, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and data sources sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors use data from the **Social Security Administration**, the **Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics Program**, and the **2010 Census**. This suggests that these sources may contain relevant datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **Data Sources and Limitations section** (Section 2), where the authors describe the datasets in detail. Here, they mention three distinct sources of data:

1. **Social Security Administration (SSA) Data**: This dataset includes detailed place-of-birth information collected when individuals were issued Social Security Numbers. It is crucial for understanding the demographics of the study population.

2. **Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics (LEHD) Program Data**: This dataset provides job-level earnings information, which is essential for analyzing long-term earnings differentials. The authors specify that they use data covering the period from 2010 to 2015.

3. **2010 Census Data**: This dataset includes detailed race and ethnicity responses, which are critical for the analysis of earnings based on self-identified racial and ethnic categories.

In the **Results section** (Section 4), the authors present findings based on these datasets, but they do not introduce new datasets. Instead, they analyze the data collected from the aforementioned sources.

Now, I will compile the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper:

1. **Social Security Administration Data**:
   > U.S. Social Security Administration. *Master Social Security Number (SSN) Database*. 

2. **Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics Program Data**:
   > Abowd, John M., Bryce Stephens, Lars Vilhuber, Fredrik Andersson, Kevin L. McKinney, Marc Roemer, and Simon Woodcock. (2009). “The LEHD Infrastructure Files and the Creation of the Quarterly Workforce Indicators” in T. Dunne, J.B. Jensen and M.J. Roberts, eds., *Producer Dynamics: New Evidence from Micro Data* (Chicago: University of Chicago Press for the National Bureau of Economic Research), pp. 149-230.

3. **2010 Census Data**:
   > U.S. Census Bureau. *2010 Census of Population and Housing*. 

After gathering this information, I will ensure that each dataset is clearly described and cited in the appropriate format for any further processing or review.
