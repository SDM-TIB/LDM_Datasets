To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Intrinsic Dimension Correlation: uncovering nonlinear connections in multimodal representations" by Lorenzo Basile et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the validation of the proposed method on synthetic data and large-scale applications, which suggests that datasets are involved, but I need to find specific names.

Next, I will look for any **dedicated sections** that might discuss datasets, such as a "Datasets" or "Experiments" section. In this paper, the authors mention using two datasets in the context of multimodal representations: **N24News** and **MS-COCO 2014**. 

In the **results section**, the authors describe how they evaluate their method on these datasets, indicating their importance in the experiments. They provide details about the types of data contained in these datasets, specifically mentioning that they consist of image-caption pairs.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For **N24News**, the citation is:
   > Zhen Wang, Xu Shan, Xiangxie Zhang, and Jie Yang. *N24news: A new dataset for multimodal news classification*. In 13th International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation Conference, LREC 2022, pages 6768–6775. European Language Resources Association (ELRA), 2022.

2. For **MS-COCO 2014**, the citation is:
   > Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, Serge Belongie, James Hays, Pietro Perona, Deva Ramanan, Piotr Dollár, and C Lawrence Zitnick. *Microsoft coco: Common objects in context*. In Computer Vision–ECCV 2014: 13th European Conference, Zurich, Switzerland, September 6-12, 2014, Proceedings, Part V 13, pages 740–755. Springer, 2014.

With these citations in hand, I can now summarize the datasets:

- **N24News**: A dataset for multimodal news classification, consisting of image-caption pairs.
- **MS-COCO 2014**: A widely used dataset in computer vision that contains images and their corresponding captions.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that each dataset is accompanied by its full citation as required.
