To extract datasets from the research paper titled "C2F2NeUS: Cascade Cost Frustum Fusion for High Fidelity and Generalizable Neural Surface Reconstruction" by Luoyuan Xu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments on the **DTU** and **BlendedMVS** datasets, indicating that these are the datasets used in their research.

Next, I will look for specific details about these datasets in the **experiments section**. The authors describe the **DTU dataset** as a well-known indoor multi-view stereo dataset consisting of 124 scenes captured under 7 distinct lighting conditions, with 75 scenes used for training and 15 for testing. They also mention that the **BlendedMVS dataset** is used for evaluating the generalization ability of their method.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. **DTU Dataset**:
   - Citation:
     > Henrik Aanæs, Rasmus Ramsbøl Jensen, George Vogiatzis, Engin Tola, and Anders Bjorholm Dahl. *Large-scale data for multiple-view stereopsis*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 120(2):153–168, 2016.

2. **BlendedMVS Dataset**:
   - Citation:
     > Yao Yao, Zixin Luo, Shiwei Li, Jingyang Zhang, Yufan Ren, Lei Zhou, Tian Fang, and Long Quan. *Blendedmvs: A large-scale dataset for generalized multi-view stereo networks*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 1790–1799, 2020.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This includes ensuring that the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations are accurately represented.
