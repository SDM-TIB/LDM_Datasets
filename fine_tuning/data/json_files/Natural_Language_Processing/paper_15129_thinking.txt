To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On Identifying Points of Semantic Shift Across Domains" by Hyung Wook Choi and Mat Kelly, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and case study sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides an overview of the study's focus on semantic evolution, but it does not explicitly mention datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the subsequent sections.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the evolution of concepts in academia and the need to track semantic changes, but again, there are no specific datasets mentioned. 

Next, I will examine the **methodology** section, where the authors describe their approach to tracking the origin of terms across different domains. They mention using the Web of Science for keyword searches, but they do not specify any datasets used in their analysis.

Moving on to the **case study** section, the authors focus on three terms: "polymorphism," "semaphore," and "ontology." They provide detailed discussions on these terms and their semantic shifts across domains, but they do not refer to any datasets in the traditional sense (like datasets containing structured data for analysis). Instead, they reference academic articles and literature as sources for their semantic analysis.

Since the paper does not explicitly mention any datasets that would fit the conventional definition (like a collection of data points or a structured dataset), I will conclude that there are no datasets to extract from this paper. However, I will still gather the relevant citations for the terms discussed, as they are critical to understanding the semantic shifts the authors are analyzing.

Now, I will compile the citations for the three terms discussed in the case study:

1. **Polymorphism**:
   - Coppo, M. (1983). On the semantics of polymorphism. *Acta Informatica*, 20, 159–170.
   - Milner, R. (1978). A theory of type polymorphism in programming. *Journal of Computer and System Sciences*, 17(3), 348–375.
   - Strachey, C. (2000). Fundamental concepts in programming languages. *Higher-order and symbolic computation*, 13, 11–49.

2. **Semaphore**:
   - Denning, P. J., Dennis, T. D., & Brumfield, J. A. (1981). Low contention semaphores and ready lists. *Communications of the ACM*, 24(10), 687–699.
   - Rony, P. R. (1981). Interfacing fundamentals-the 8255-semaphores. *COMPUTER DESIGN*, 20(3), 150–152.

3. **Ontology**:
   - Lenat, D., & Guha, R. V. (1990). Cyc: A midterm report. *AI Magazine*, 11(3), 32–32.
   - Gruber, T. R. (1993). A translation approach to portable ontology specifications. *Knowledge Acquisition*, 5(2), 199–220.

In summary, while the paper does not provide traditional datasets, it does reference significant academic works that contribute to the understanding of semantic shifts. I will ensure to document these citations accurately for future reference.
