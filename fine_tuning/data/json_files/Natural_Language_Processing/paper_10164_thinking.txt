To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Enhancing Supply Chain Resilience: A Machine Learning Approach for Predicting Product Availability Dates Under Disruption" by Mustafa Can Camur et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the prediction of product availability dates for General Electric (GE) Gas Powerâ€™s inbound shipments, which suggests that there is a dataset involved, likely related to historical shipment data.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Data Set Discussion)**, where the authors describe the dataset used for their analysis. They mention that the historical data regarding availability dates is stored in Oracle Transportation Management (OTM). This indicates that the dataset is proprietary and not publicly available, but I will still note its significance in the context of the study.

In this section, the authors also describe the features used to predict availability dates, which include:
- Part Number
- Supplier Code
- Supplier Location
- Product Cost
- Product Amount
- Product Details
- Contract Delivery Time
- Latest Need by Date
- Latest Promised Date
- Approval Date

While these features provide insight into the dataset's structure, the actual dataset itself is not named or cited in a formal manner.

Since the dataset is not publicly available, I will not be able to provide a full citation for it. However, I will note that the authors reference their use of Oracle Transportation Management (OTM) as the source of their data.

Now, I will check the **References section** to see if there are any citations related to the dataset or the data management system used. However, it appears that the dataset itself does not have a formal citation since it is proprietary.

In summary, the key points regarding the dataset are:
- The dataset is historical data on product availability dates stored in Oracle Transportation Management (OTM).
- The dataset includes various features that are critical for predicting availability dates, but it is not publicly accessible.

I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity, ensuring to highlight the proprietary nature of the dataset and the absence of a formal citation.
