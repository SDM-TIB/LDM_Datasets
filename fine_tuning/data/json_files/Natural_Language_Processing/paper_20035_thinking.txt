To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Computational Modelling of Plurality and Definiteness in Chinese Noun Phrases" by Yuqi Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and dataset sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the construction of a corpus of Chinese noun phrases (NPs) annotated with plurality and definiteness, which indicates that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Dataset)**, where the authors describe the construction of their dataset in detail. They explain that they built a large-scale dataset from a parallel corpus of English and Chinese sentences, specifically using a TV episode subtitle corpus. This section provides crucial information about the dataset's content and structure.

In **subsection 2.1 (Dataset Construction)**, the authors outline the steps taken to create the dataset, including word alignment, NP identification, and annotation processes. They mention that the dataset contains 124,000 annotated NPs, categorized by their plurality and definiteness. This is a significant detail that confirms the dataset's size and purpose.

The authors also provide basic statistics about the dataset in **Table 1**, which summarizes the counts of singular/plural and definite/indefinite NPs. This information is essential for understanding the dataset's composition.

Now, I will look for the **full citation** of the dataset mentioned in the paper. The authors refer to the original source of the parallel corpus used for their dataset construction, which is the work by Wang et al. (2018). The citation for this source is:

> Longyue Wang, Zhaopeng Tu, Shuming Shi, Tong Zhang, Yvette Graham, and Qun Liu. *Translating pro-drop languages with reconstruction models*. In Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, volume 32, 2018.

Additionally, the authors reference another work by Wang et al. (2016) that inspired their approach to dataset construction. The citation for this work is:

> Longyue Wang, Zhaopeng Tu, Xiaojun Zhang, Hang Li, Andy Way, and Qun Liu. *A novel approach to dropped pronoun translation*. In Proceedings of the 2016 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, pages 983â€“993, San Diego, California.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
