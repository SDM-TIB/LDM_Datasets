To extract datasets from the research paper titled "From Zero to Hero: How local curvature at artless initial conditions leads away from bad minima" by Tony Bonnaire et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and the introduction often discusses the context and previous work, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will specifically look for sections that typically contain dataset information, such as **section 4 (Numerical analysis)** or any section explicitly labeled as "Datasets" or "Data." In this paper, the authors describe their numerical experiments, which may involve specific datasets or simulated data.

Upon reviewing the relevant sections, I will note any datasets mentioned. For instance, if the authors refer to a specific dataset used for simulations or experiments, I will record its name and any details provided about it, such as the number of samples, dimensions, or specific characteristics.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial, as proper citation allows others to locate the original sources of the datasets. I will look for papers or resources that describe the datasets in detail.

For example, if the authors mention using a dataset like the "Phase Retrieval Dataset," I will search for its citation in the references. If it is not explicitly listed, I may need to look for the original dataset paper or resource online.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details and that the citations are accurate and complete.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for output, ensuring they are clear and ready for any further processing or review.
