To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MF-OML: Online Mean-Field Reinforcement Learning with Occupation Measures for Large Population Games" by Anran Hu and Junzi Zhang, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract often provides a concise summary of the work, including any datasets used. If the authors mention specific datasets or benchmarks, I will note them down.

Next, I will carefully examine the **introduction** section, as it typically outlines the context and significance of the research. If the authors reference any datasets or prior works that utilized specific datasets, I will make a note of those as well.

Then, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **experiments**. In this section, the authors usually describe the datasets in detail, including their characteristics, size, and how they were used in the experiments. I will extract the names and descriptions of each dataset mentioned.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily. I will ensure to include the authors, title, publication venue, and year for each dataset.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like the "OpenAI Gym" for reinforcement learning experiments, I would look for its citation, which might be something like:
> Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L., Schneider, J., Schulman, J., Tang, J., & Zaremba, W. (2016). *OpenAI Gym*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01549.

Finally, I will compile all the extracted datasets along with their full citations into a structured format for easy reference.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant datasets from the paper along with their proper citations.
