To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Ultra-High-Definition Image Deraining: A Benchmark and An Efficient Method" by Hongming Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract introduces the **4K-Rain13k** dataset, which is a significant contribution of the paper, indicating that it contains 13,000 image pairs at 4K resolution. This is a clear indication that I need to focus on this dataset.

Next, I will examine **section 1 (Introduction)**, where the authors discuss the need for a UHD image deraining dataset and mention the **4K-Rain13k** dataset again. They provide details about its composition, including the number of training and testing pairs, which will be important for my dataset description.

In **section 3 (UHD Image Deraining Dataset Construction)**, the authors provide a detailed description of how the **4K-Rain13k** dataset was constructed, including the methods used for background collection, rain streak generation, and geometric transformation. This section will give me the necessary details to describe the dataset comprehensively.

I will also look for any other datasets mentioned in the paper, particularly in the **Related Work** section, where the authors reference several existing datasets used for image deraining, such as **Rain200L/H**, **Rain13k**, and others. I will note these datasets as well, as they may be relevant for context or comparison.

Now, I will check the **References section** to gather full citations for each dataset mentioned. The citations will be crucial for providing proper attribution.

1. **4K-Rain13k**: The citation is not explicitly provided in the references, as it is a new dataset introduced in this paper. However, I will note that it is a significant contribution of the authors.

2. **Rain200L/H**: The citation is:
   > Xueyang Fu, Jiabin Huang, Delu Zeng, Yue Huang, Xinghao Ding, and John Paisley. *Removing rain from single images via a deep detail network*. In CVPR, pages 3855–3863, 2017.

3. **Rain13k**: The citation is:
   > Xueyang Fu, Borong Liang, Yue Huang, Xinghao Ding, and John Paisley. *Lightweight pyramid networks for image deraining*. IEEE TNNLS, 31(6):1794–1807, 2019.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets discussed in the paper, along with proper attribution.
