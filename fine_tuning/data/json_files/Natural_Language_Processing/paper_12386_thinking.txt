To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Computational Image Formation: Simulators in the Deep Learning Era" by Stanley H. Chan, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** to see if any datasets are mentioned or referenced. The abstract discusses the concept of computational image formation (CIF) and mentions various simulators, but it does not explicitly name any datasets.

Next, I will examine the **main body of the paper**, particularly sections that discuss case studies or examples. I will look for any specific datasets used for experiments or simulations. For instance, the paper discusses imaging through atmospheric turbulence and mentions various models and simulators, but I need to confirm if any datasets are explicitly referenced.

In the **case study section**, I will pay close attention to any examples that might involve datasets. The paper discusses atmospheric turbulence and various models, but I will need to check if any datasets are used for training or evaluation purposes.

I will also review the **references section** to see if any datasets are cited in the context of previous works. This could provide leads on datasets that are relevant to the research discussed in the paper.

After thoroughly reviewing the paper, I will compile a list of any datasets identified, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset. If the paper references datasets from other works, I will extract those citations as well.

For example, if I find that the paper references a dataset used in atmospheric turbulence simulations, I will document it as follows:

1. **Dataset Name**: Atmospheric Turbulence Dataset
   - **Description**: A dataset used for simulating atmospheric turbulence effects in imaging.
   - **Citation**: [Author(s), Title, Journal/Conference, Year, Pages].

If no specific datasets are mentioned, I will note that as well, indicating that the paper primarily discusses concepts and models without referencing specific datasets.

Finally, I will ensure that all citations are formatted correctly and are complete, as this is crucial for proper attribution and further research.
