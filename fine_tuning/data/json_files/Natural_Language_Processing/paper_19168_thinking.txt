To extract datasets from the research paper titled "FairSync: Ensuring Amortized Group Exposure in Distributed Recommendation Retrieval" by Jun Xu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. In the abstract, the authors mention that they conducted experiments on **two public recommender retrieval datasets**, which indicates that datasets are indeed involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (specifically section 5.1.1), where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. They mention:

1. **Amazon-Book Dataset**: This dataset is described as a subset of the Amazon Product dataset, specifically focusing on the book domain. The authors note that item grouping relies on the field "categories" and provide additional details about the dataset's structure.

2. **Taobao Dataset**: This dataset consists of user behavior data collected from Taobao's recommender systems over a specific period. The authors explain that item grouping is based on the "category ID" field.

I will also check the **statistics table (Table 1)** for additional details about the datasets, such as the number of users, items, groups, and interactions, which can help provide a comprehensive description of each dataset.

Now, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations may not be explicitly provided for the datasets themselves, but I will note the relevant papers or sources that describe these datasets:

- For the **Amazon-Book Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Ruining He and Julian McAuley. *Ups and downs: Modeling the visual evolution of fashion trends with one-class collaborative filtering*. In Proceedings of the 25th International Conference on World Wide Web, 2016.

- For the **Taobao Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Han Zhu et al. *Learning tree-based deep model for recommender systems*. In Proceedings of the 24th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery & Data Mining, 2018.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes the full citation for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
