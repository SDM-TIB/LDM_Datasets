To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Graph Regularized NMF with ℓ2,0-norm for Unsupervised Feature Learning" by Zhen Wang and Wenwen Min, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for validation. The introduction often discusses the context and significance of the datasets, while the experiments section typically details the datasets used for testing the proposed methods.

In the **introduction**, I will look for any references to datasets that the authors might have used to validate their approach. If the authors mention specific datasets or benchmarks, I will note them down.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**. This section usually contains detailed information about the datasets used, including their characteristics, sizes, and any specific splits (e.g., training/test splits). I will look for subsections that explicitly mention datasets, such as "Datasets" or "Experimental Setup."

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **LIBRAS Dataset**: This dataset is used for sign language recognition and consists of video sequences of Brazilian Sign Language gestures performed by different individuals. It captures variations in hand shapes, movements, and orientations.

2. **UMIST Dataset**: A popular face recognition dataset containing grayscale images of faces from 20 different individuals, with varying poses, expressions, and lighting conditions.

3. **JAFFE Dataset**: This dataset is used for facial expression analysis and consists of grayscale images of Japanese female faces displaying seven different facial expressions.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and further exploration of the datasets.

- For the **LIBRAS Dataset**, the citation is:
  > D. Dua, C. Graff et al., “UCI Machine Learning Repository,” 2017.

- For the **UMIST Dataset**, the citation is:
  > G. C. McLachlan and K. E. Basford, *Mixture Models: Inference and Applications to Clustering*, 1988.

- For the **JAFFE Dataset**, the citation is:
  > M. Koike, “The Japanese Female Facial Expression (JAFFE) Database,” 2000.

With the datasets identified and their citations retrieved, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and future reference. This process ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their respective citations.
