To extract datasets from the research paper titled "POND: Multi-Source Time Series Domain Adaptation with Information-Aware Prompt Tuning" by Junxiang Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract states that the proposed POND model is validated through experiments across **four datasets**, which indicates that multiple datasets are involved.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors mention that they conducted experiments on **four benchmark datasets**: **HAR**, **WISDM**, **HHAR**, and **SSC**. I will note down these names as they are crucial for the dataset entries.

I will then check the **experimental settings** section for more details about each dataset. The paper provides a brief description of each dataset, including the number of domains, channels, classes, and sequence lengths. Here’s what I find:

1. **HAR Dataset**: 
   - Description: The Human Activity Recognition dataset incorporates data collected from three sensors (accelerometer, gyroscope, and body sensors) deployed on 30 subjects engaged in six distinct activities.
   - Citation: 
     > Davide Anguita, Alessandro Ghio, Luca Oneto, Xavier Parra, Jorge Luis Reyes-Ortiz. *A public domain dataset for human activity recognition using smartphones*. In Esann, volume 3, page 3, 2013.

2. **WISDM Dataset**: 
   - Description: The WIreless Sensor Data Mining dataset uses accelerometer sensors and involves 36 subjects participating in activities similar to the HAR dataset, with additional challenges due to class distribution imbalances.
   - Citation: 
     > Jennifer R. Kwapisz, Gary M. Weiss, Samuel A. Moore. *Activity recognition using cell phone accelerometers*. ACM SigKDD Explorations Newsletter, 12(2):74–82, 2011.

3. **HHAR Dataset**: 
   - Description: The Heterogeneity Human Activity Recognition dataset was collected from 9 subjects using sensor readings from smartphones and smartwatches.
   - Citation: 
     > Allan Stisen, Henrik Blunck, Sourav Bhattacharya, Thor Siiger Prentow, Mikkel Baun Kjærgaard, Anind Dey, Tobias Sonne, Mads Møller Jensen. *Smart devices are different: Assessing and mitigating mobile sensing heterogeneities for activity recognition*. In Proceedings of the 13th ACM conference on embedded networked sensor systems, pages 127–140, 2015.

4. **SSC Dataset**: 
   - Description: The Sleep Stage Classification problem aims to categorize electroencephalography (EEG) signals into five stages, utilizing the Sleep-EDF dataset, which includes EEG recordings from 20 healthy subjects.
   - Citation: 
     > Ary L. Goldberger, Luis A.N. Amaral, Leon Glass, Jeffrey M. Hausdorff, Plamen Ch. Ivanov, Roger G. Mark, Joseph E. Mietus, George B. Moody, Chung-Kang Peng, H. Eugene Stanley. *Physiobank, physiotoolkit, and physionet: components of a new research resource for complex physiologic signals*. Circulation, 101(23):e215–e220, 2000.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This structured approach will help maintain clarity and ensure that all relevant details are captured accurately for future reference or processing.
