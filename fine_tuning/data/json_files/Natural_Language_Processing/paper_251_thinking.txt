To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Relation Extraction Datasets in the Digital Humanities Domain and their Evaluation with Word Embeddings" by Gerhard Wohlgenannt et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or alluded to. The abstract indicates that the authors created high-quality datasets for evaluating language models in the digital humanities domain, specifically for two fantasy novel series. This suggests that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Methods)**, where the authors describe the dataset creation process. Here, they mention that they created datasets for two book series: "A Song of Ice and Fire" (ASOIF) by George R. R. Martin and "Harry Potter" (HP) by J.K. Rowling. They specify that they created datasets for two task types: analogy and doesn’t-match, which indicates that there are multiple datasets to extract.

In **section 4.2 (Dataset Description)**, the authors provide a detailed list of the datasets created:

1. **questions soiaf analogies.txt**: This dataset contains analogical reasoning tasks for the ASOIF series, with a total of 2848 tasks across 8 different task types.

2. **hp soiaf analogies.txt**: This dataset includes analogical reasoning tasks for the Harry Potter series, comprising 4790 tasks across 17 different task types.

3. **questions soiaf doesn’t match.txt**: This dataset contains doesn’t-match tasks for ASOIF, with a total of 11180 tasks across 13 sections.

4. **questions hp doesn’t match.txt**: This dataset includes doesn’t-match tasks for the Harry Potter series, with a total of 8340 tasks across 19 sections.

Additionally, the authors mention that there are n-gram versions of these datasets, which are also relevant:

5. **questions soiaf analogies ngram.txt**: N-gram analogical reasoning tasks for ASOIF.

6. **hp soiaf analogies ngram.txt**: N-gram analogical reasoning tasks for Harry Potter.

7. **questions soiaf doesn’t match ngram.txt**: N-gram doesn’t-match tasks for ASOIF.

8. **questions hp doesn’t match ngram.txt**: N-gram doesn’t-match tasks for Harry Potter.

Now, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets. The datasets are based on the two book series, so I will cite the original works:

- For **A Song of Ice and Fire**:
  > Martin, G. R. R. *A Song of Ice and Fire*. Bantam Books, 1996-2011.

- For **Harry Potter**:
  > Rowling, J. K. *Harry Potter Series*. Bloomsbury, 1997-2007.

With this information, I can now compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes the full citation for the respective book series.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring clarity and completeness for future reference or processing.
