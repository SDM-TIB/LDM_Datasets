To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On TinyML and Cybersecurity: Electric Vehicle Charging Infrastructure Use Case" by Fatemeh Dehrouyeh et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of TinyML in cybersecurity for Electric Vehicle Charging Infrastructures (EVCIs), which suggests that there may be relevant datasets used for experiments or evaluations.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental setup and results section**, as this is typically where datasets are described in detail. In this paper, the authors mention the **CICIDS2017 dataset**, which is provided by the Canadian Institute for Cybersecurity. This dataset is crucial for their study as it includes a diverse range of common cyber-attacks, making it suitable for evaluating intrusion detection systems (IDS).

I will also look for any additional datasets mentioned in the **case study** or **results sections**. The authors discuss the creation of an EVCI dataset, which is derived from the CICIDS2017 dataset, indicating that they have modified or balanced the original dataset for their specific use case.

Now, I will compile the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. **CICIDS2017 Dataset**:
   - Citation: 
     > I. Sharafaldin, A. H. Lashkari, and A. A. Ghorbani. "Toward generating a new intrusion detection dataset and intrusion traffic characterization." In *International Conference on Information Systems Security and Privacy*, 2018.

2. **EVCI Dataset**:
   - Since the EVCI dataset is derived from the CICIDS2017 dataset and does not have a separate citation, I will note that it is a modified version of the CICIDS2017 dataset used specifically for the authors' experiments.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets in a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citations as required. This will provide a clear reference for each dataset used in the research paper.
