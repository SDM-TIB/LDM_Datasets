To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Distribution-Based Low-Rank Embedding" by Bardia Yousefi, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, results, and discussion sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on thermography for breast cancer detection, but I need to look for specific datasets used in the experiments.

In the **introduction**, the author discusses the significance of thermography and mentions the use of various computational techniques. However, I need to find explicit mentions of datasets.

Next, I will examine the **methods section** closely, particularly any subsections that detail the experimental setup or data collection. Here, I will look for any tables or figures that might summarize the datasets used in the study. For instance, I notice a reference to a "thermal breast cancer screening database" in the results section, which suggests that a specific dataset is being utilized.

In **section 4.1 (Study Population)**, the author describes the demographics and clinical information of the participants involved in the study. This section provides valuable insights into the dataset, including the number of participants and their characteristics. The mention of a "thermal breast cancer screening database" indicates that this is a key dataset for the research.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. The paper cites various studies and databases that may be relevant. For example, if the "DMR - Database for Mastology Research" is referenced, I will need to locate its full citation.

After gathering all relevant information, I will compile the datasets into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and for readers who may wish to access the datasets themselves.

Finally, I will summarize the findings, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described, including its purpose, size, and any relevant details that were mentioned in the paper. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.
