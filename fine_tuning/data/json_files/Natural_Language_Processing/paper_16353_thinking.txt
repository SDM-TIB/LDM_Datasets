To extract datasets from the research paper titled "VIT-LENS: Towards Omni-modal Representations" by Weixian Lei et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that VIT-LENS is tailored for various modalities, which suggests that multiple datasets may be involved. I will look for specific mentions of datasets in these sections.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, descriptions, and any relevant details about their structure or purpose.

In this section, the authors list several datasets used for evaluation, including:

1. **ModelNet40 (MN40)**: A widely used benchmark for 3D object recognition, consisting of 12,311 CAD models from 40 categories.
2. **Objaverse-LVIS (O-LVIS)**: An annotated subset of Objaverse, containing 46,832 shapes from 1,156 categories.
3. **ScanObjectNN (SONN)**: A dataset for 3D object recognition and segmentation, containing 2,902 objects across 15 categories.
4. **SUN Depth-only (SUN-D)**: A dataset with paired RGB and depth maps for scene classification.
5. **NYU-v2 Depth-only (NYU-D)**: A dataset for depth maps with 16 semantic classes.
6. **Audioset (AS)**: A dataset for audio classification, containing 10-second videos annotated across 527 classes.
7. **ESC (ESC 5-folds)**: A dataset for environmental sound classification, containing 2,000 sound recordings across 50 classes.
8. **Clotho**: An audio dataset paired with textual descriptions for audio captioning.
9. **AudioCaps**: A dataset of audio-visual clips with textual descriptions.
10. **VGGSound**: An audio-visual dataset containing around 200k video clips.
11. **Touch-and-go**: A dataset for tactile classification tasks.
12. **ImageNet-EEG (IN-EEG)**: A dataset comprising EEG recordings aligned with images from ImageNet.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. This is crucial for ensuring that each dataset is properly credited. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
