To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fully Spiking Actor Network with Intra-layer Connections for Reinforcement Learning" by Ding Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention any datasets used for evaluation. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets, while the experiments section typically details the datasets used for testing the proposed methods.

In the **introduction**, I will look for any references to datasets that the authors might have used in their experiments. If the authors mention specific datasets or benchmarks, I will note them down for further investigation.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**. This section is crucial as it usually contains detailed information about the datasets used for training and evaluation. I will look for subsections that explicitly mention datasets, such as "Datasets" or "Experimental Setup." Here, I will identify the names of the datasets, their characteristics, and any relevant statistics provided by the authors.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is important for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. I will ensure that I capture all necessary details such as authors, title, publication venue, and year.

For this paper, I will specifically look for datasets related to reinforcement learning tasks, particularly those mentioned in the context of the OpenAI Gym, as the authors state that their method is evaluated on continuous control tasks from OpenAI Gym.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research and their significance in the context of the study.

Finally, I will summarize the findings in a clear and organized manner, ready for further processing or review.
