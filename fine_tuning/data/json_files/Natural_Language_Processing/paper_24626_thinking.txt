To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Captioning Visualizations with Large Language Models (CVLLM): A Tutorial" by Giuseppe Carenini et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections discussing past editions and recent advances** to find any references to datasets. The abstract provides a general overview, but I will focus on the sections that are likely to contain specific dataset information.

In **section 3.2.2 (Recent Advances and Challenges in InfoVis Captioning)**, the authors discuss significant contributions from various researchers, which include the introduction of large datasets. Here, I will note the datasets mentioned:

1. **Kantharaj et al. (2022) Dataset**: This dataset contains **44,096 items**, including charts, data tables, and captions, primarily focusing on level 2 of semantic content.

2. **Tang et al. (2023) Dataset**: This dataset includes **12,441 items**, comprising charts, scene-graphs, data tables, and structured captions, incorporating levels 2 and 3 of semantic content through crowdsourcing.

Next, I will verify the details of these datasets by checking the **References section** for full citations. This is crucial for proper attribution and to ensure that the datasets can be accurately referenced in future work.

The citations I need to extract are:

- For the **Kantharaj et al. (2022) Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Shankar Kantharaj, Rixie Tiffany Ko Leong, Xiang Lin, Ahmed Masry, Megh Thakkar, Enamul Hoque, and Shafiq Joty. *Chart-to-text: A large-scale benchmark for chart summarization*. 2022.

- For the **Tang et al. (2023) Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Benny J. Tang, Angie Boggust, and Arvind Satyanarayan. *Vistext: A benchmark for semantically rich chart captioning*. 2023.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
