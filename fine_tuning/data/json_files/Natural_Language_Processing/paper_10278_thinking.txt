To extract datasets from the research paper titled “When Words Fail, Emojis Prevail”: Generating Sarcastic Utterances with Emoji Using Valence Reversal and Semantic Incongruity by Faria Binte Kader et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors have created and published a sarcastic corpus, which suggests that there is a dataset involved.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **introduction**. The authors discuss the need for quality datasets to train machines to detect sarcasm, which implies that they may have used existing datasets or created their own.

In the **methodology section**, particularly in **section 4.1 (Dataset)**, the authors explicitly mention using the **Positive and Negative sentiment corpora by Mishra et al. (2019)**. They describe how they filtered and processed this dataset to create a final dataset of 2,000 sarcastic sentences. This is a crucial dataset for their experiments.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the dataset mentioned. The citation for the Positive and Negative sentiment corpora is:

- **Mishra et al. (2019)**: 
  > Abhijit Mishra, Tarun Tater, and Karthik Sankaranarayanan. *A modular architecture for unsupervised sarcasm generation*. In Proceedings of the 2019 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing and the 9th International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing (EMNLP-IJCNLP), pages 6144–6154, 2019.

Now, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the dataset as it is essential for proper attribution.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will prepare the dataset entries for review or further processing.
