To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Linguistically-Informed Neural Architectures for Lexical, Syntactic and Semantic Tasks in Sanskrit" by Jivnesh Sandhan, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

1. **Read the Abstract and Introduction**: I will start by examining the abstract and introduction sections of the paper. These sections often provide a summary of the research focus and may mention key datasets used in the study. I will look for any explicit references to datasets or data sources.

2. **Identify Sections on Datasets**: Next, I will navigate to sections that are likely to discuss datasets in detail. In this paper, I will specifically look for sections titled "Datasets," "Experiments," or any similar headings that indicate the use of datasets. 

3. **Extract Dataset Information**: In the relevant sections, I will extract information about each dataset mentioned. This includes:
   - The name of the dataset.
   - A brief description of the dataset, including its purpose, size, and any specific characteristics.
   - Any specific tasks or experiments that utilized the dataset.

4. **Check the References Section**: After identifying the datasets, I will consult the references section of the paper to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for the datasets used in the research.

5. **Compile the Information**: I will compile the extracted information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset entry includes:
   - The dataset name.
   - A description of the dataset.
   - The full citation for the dataset as found in the references section.

6. **Review for Completeness**: Finally, I will review the entire paper to ensure that I have not missed any datasets mentioned in other sections, such as the literature review or methodology. This thorough review will help ensure that all relevant datasets are captured.

By following these steps, I will be able to extract the datasets from the paper effectively and ensure that I have the necessary citations for each dataset.
