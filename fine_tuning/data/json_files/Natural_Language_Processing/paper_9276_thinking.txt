To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Agile Text Classifiers for Everyone" by Max Mozes et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors experimented with **7 datasets from three safety-related domains**, which suggests that multiple datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **Datasets section (Section 3)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used in their experiments. This section is crucial as it outlines the specific datasets and their characteristics.

In **Section 3.1 (Dialogue Safety)**, the authors mention five datasets based on the ParlAI and Bot Adversarial Dialogue (BAD) data collection efforts. The datasets are:

1. **ParlAI Single Standard**: Contains 24,000 training examples, with a predefined split for validation and testing.
2. **ParlAI Single Adversarial**: Similar to the Single Standard but focuses on offensive content.
3. **ParlAI Multi**: A multi-turn conversational dataset with offensive utterances.
4. **BAD-2**: A truncated version of the BAD dataset with the last two utterances of conversations.
5. **BAD-4**: A truncated version of the BAD dataset with the last four utterances of conversations.

In **Section 3.2 (Unhealthy Comment Corpus)**, the authors describe the **Unhealthy Comment Corpus (UCC)**, which consists of 44,355 comments labeled for various unhealthy attributes. This dataset is significant for understanding toxicity in online comments.

In **Section 3.3 (Neutral Responses)**, the authors introduce a new dataset they created, called the **Neutral Responses dataset**, which contains 150 examples annotated for multiple perspectives, neutrality, and explanation quality.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For the **Neutral Responses dataset**:
  The authors did not provide a specific citation for this dataset since it is newly created, but I will note that it is described in detail within the paper.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.
