To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DeepCSHAP: Utilizing Shapley Values to Explain Deep Complex-Valued Neural Networks" by Florian Eilers and Xiaoyi Jiang, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention evaluating their explanation methods on two datasets: **MNIST** and **S1SLC_CVDL**. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for the experiments conducted in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **experiments**. In this paper, the datasets are discussed in **section 6 (Evaluation)**, where the authors describe their experiments on both the MNIST dataset and the S1SLC_CVDL dataset. 

1. **MNIST Dataset**: The authors mention using a small complex-valued CNN on the MNIST dataset, which consists of handwritten digits. They report a test accuracy of 88% on this dataset.

2. **S1SLC_CVDL Dataset**: This dataset consists of complex-valued PolSAR image patches from three North American city areas, labeled with seven classes. The model achieves a test accuracy of 93% on this dataset.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **MNIST dataset**, the citation is:
  > LeCun, Y. (1998). The MNIST database of handwritten digits. Retrieved from http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

- For the **S1SLC_CVDL dataset**, the citation is:
  > Asiyabi, R.M., Datcu, M., Anghel, A., & Nies, H. (2023). Complex-valued end-to-end deep network with coherency preservation for complex-valued SAR data reconstruction and classification. IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing.

With these details, I can now summarize the datasets extracted from the paper, ensuring to include the full citations for each.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
