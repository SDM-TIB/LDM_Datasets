To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Automated Measurement of Pericoronary Adipose Tissue Attenuation and Volume in CT Angiography" by Andrew M. Nguyen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors used a "large subset of patients from the public ImageCAS dataset (n = 735)" for training their model. This suggests that the ImageCAS dataset is a key dataset in this research.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** and **methods sections** for further details about the datasets. In the introduction, the authors discuss the significance of pericoronary adipose tissue (PCAT) and its measurement, but they primarily focus on the methodology rather than introducing new datasets.

In the **methods section**, specifically under **2.1 Data**, the authors provide a detailed description of the ImageCAS dataset. They mention that it consists of 1000 3D CCTA volumes acquired from 1000 patients, with specific demographic details and imaging protocols. This section confirms that the ImageCAS dataset is the primary dataset used in their study.

I will also check the **experiments and results sections** to see if any additional datasets are mentioned or if the authors refer to any other datasets used for validation or comparison. However, the focus remains on the ImageCAS dataset throughout the paper.

Finally, I will look at the **references section** to find the full citation for the ImageCAS dataset. The relevant citation is:

- For the **ImageCAS dataset**:
  > A. Zeng et al., “ImageCAS: A large-scale dataset and benchmark for coronary artery segmentation based on computed tomography angiography images,” Computerized Medical Imaging and Graphics, vol. 109, no. 2023, pp. 102287, 2023.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entry for the ImageCAS dataset, ensuring to include the full citation as required. This will allow for a structured representation of the dataset used in the research paper.
