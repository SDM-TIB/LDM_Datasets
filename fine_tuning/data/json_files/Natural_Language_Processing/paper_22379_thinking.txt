To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Robust and Explainable Fine-Grained Visual Classification with Transfer Learning: A Dual-Carriageway Framework" by Zheming Zuo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors validated their framework through experiments with two temporally continued commercial product datasets, which indicates that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Materials)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used in their research. They mention two RGB image datasets, referred to as **Dataset A** and **Dataset B**, which contain images of the bottom side of commercial products from two manufacturers labeled 'F1' and 'F2'. The paper states that Dataset A contains 5,870 images and Dataset B contains 3,112 images, with specific details about the training, validation, and test splits.

In **section 4.1 (Experimental Setups and Evaluation Metrics)**, the authors provide additional context about how these datasets were utilized in their experiments, confirming their importance in the study.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. However, since the datasets are proprietary and provided by industrial partners, they may not have formal citations like publicly available datasets. Instead, I will document them as follows:

1. **Dataset A**: A proprietary dataset containing 5,870 RGB images of commercial products from manufacturer 'F1' and 'F2'.
2. **Dataset B**: A proprietary dataset containing 3,112 RGB images of commercial products from manufacturer 'F1' and 'F2'.

Since these datasets do not have formal citations, I will note that they were provided by the authors' industrial partners, specifically Procter & Gamble.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that captures the essential details, including the dataset names, descriptions, and any relevant information about their usage in the research.

In summary, I will extract the following datasets from the paper:

- **Dataset A**: Proprietary dataset with 5,870 RGB images.
- **Dataset B**: Proprietary dataset with 3,112 RGB images.

I will ensure to mention that these datasets were provided by Procter & Gamble, as they do not have formal citations.
