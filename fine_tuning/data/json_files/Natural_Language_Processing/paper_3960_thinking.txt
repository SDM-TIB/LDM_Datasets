To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ViTA: Visual-Linguistic Translation by Aligning Object Tags" by Kshitij Gupta et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract highlights the lack of quality datasets for multimodal translation, which suggests that the authors may reference specific datasets later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (System Overview)**, particularly **subsection 3.1 (Dataset Description)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets they used. Here, they mention two key datasets:

1. **Hindi Visual Genome Dataset**: This dataset consists of images and their associated English captions from the Visual Genome, along with Hindi translations. The authors note that it includes a challenge test set designed to resolve ambiguities in translation.

2. **IIT Bombay English-Hindi Parallel Corpus**: Released by Kunchukuttan et al. (2018), this dataset contains 1,609,682 parallel sentences in English and Hindi, which the authors used for fine-tuning their translation model.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **Hindi Visual Genome Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Shantipriya Parida, Ondřej Bojar, and Satya Ranjan Dash. *Hindi Visual Genome: A Dataset for Multimodal English-to-Hindi Machine Translation*. Computación y Sistemas, 23(4):1499–1505, 2019. Presented at CICLing 2019, La Rochelle, France.

- For the **IIT Bombay English-Hindi Parallel Corpus**, the citation is:
  > Anoop Kunchukuttan, Pratik Mehta, and Pushpak Bhattacharyya. *The IIT Bombay English-Hindi Parallel Corpus*. In Proceedings of the Eleventh International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC 2018), Miyazaki, Japan. European Language Resources Association (ELRA).

Now that I have the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their proper citations.
