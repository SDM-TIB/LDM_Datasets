To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MIMO-OFDM ISAC Waveform Design for Range-Doppler Sidelobe Suppression" by Peishi Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention any datasets used for simulations or evaluations. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the research, which might include references to specific datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **experiments** within the paper. This section typically contains detailed descriptions of the datasets used, including their names, sizes, and any relevant characteristics. If such a section is present, I will extract the names and descriptions of the datasets directly from there.

If the datasets are not explicitly listed in a dedicated section, I will search through the **methodology** and **results** sections. These sections often contain references to datasets used for simulations or experiments, including any performance metrics evaluated against these datasets.

Once I identify the datasets, I will ensure to check the **references section** of the paper for full citations. This is crucial as it provides the necessary bibliographic information for each dataset, which may include the authors, title, publication venue, and year of publication.

For this specific paper, I will look for datasets related to MIMO-OFDM ISAC systems, radar sensing, and communication performance metrics. I will document each dataset with its full citation as follows:

1. **Dataset Name**: Description of the dataset, including its purpose, size, and any specific characteristics.
   - **Citation**: Full citation in the appropriate format.

After gathering all relevant datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference and further analysis. This ensures that all extracted datasets are properly credited and can be easily located for future research or validation purposes.
