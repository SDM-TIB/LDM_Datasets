To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Verification-Friendly Deep Neural Networks" by Anahita Baninajjar et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and evaluation sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the evaluation of the proposed framework on several datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed present in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **evaluation section** where the authors explicitly discuss the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention three datasets:

1. **MNIST Dataset**: This dataset is described as a collection of grayscale handwritten digits, with each digit represented by a 28Ã—28 pixel image. The authors specify that they used the first 400 images of the test set and split MNIST into validation and test sets.

2. **CHB-MIT Dataset**: This dataset is used for real-time epileptic seizure detection based on EEG data. The authors provide details about the dataset, including the number of individuals involved, the recording method, and the sampling frequency. They also mention how they split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets.

3. **MIT-BIH Dataset**: This dataset is utilized for cardiac arrhythmia detection based on ECG data. The authors describe the dataset's composition, including the number of records and the demographic details of the subjects. They also explain how they partitioned the dataset for training, validation, and testing.

After identifying these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to obtain the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **MNIST Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun. *The MNIST database of handwritten digits*. http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/, 1998.

- For the **CHB-MIT Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Ali Shoeb. *CHB-MIT Scalp EEG Database*, 2010.

- For the **MIT-BIH Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Ary L Goldberger, Luis AN Amaral, Leon Glass, Jeffrey M Hausdorff, Plamen Ch Ivanov, Roger G Mark, Joseph E Mietus, George B Moody, Chung-Kang Peng, and H Eugene Stanley. *MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database*, 2000.

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This will prepare the information for structured output or further processing.
