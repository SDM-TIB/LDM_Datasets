To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Neural Networks Architectures from the Perspective of Manifold Learning" by German Magai, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions a "wide range of experiments with various datasets," which indicates that multiple datasets are likely discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental setup section** where the author lists the datasets used for image classification tasks and NLP tasks. Here, I will identify the specific datasets mentioned:

1. **CIFAR-10**: This dataset is commonly used for image classification tasks and consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes.
2. **Street View House Numbers (SVHN)**: This dataset contains images of house numbers collected from Google Street View, used for digit recognition tasks.
3. **ImageNet**: A large-scale dataset for image classification, containing millions of images across thousands of categories.
4. **Emotional Coloring Tweets Dataset**: This dataset includes tweets annotated with emotional labels, covering eight basic emotions.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical report, Citeseer, 2009.

- For **Street View House Numbers (SVHN)**, the citation is:
  > Yuval Netzer, Tao Wang, Adam Coates, Alessandro Bissacco, Bo Wu, and Andrew Y. Ng. *Reading Digits in Natural Images with Unsupervised Feature Learning*. Journal, 2011.

- For **ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li Li, Kai Li, and Li Fei-Fei. *Imagenet: A Large-Scale Hierarchical Image Database*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 248â€“255, 2009.

- For the **Emotional Coloring Tweets Dataset**, the citation is:
  > E. Saravia et al. *CARER: Contextualized Affect Representations for Emotion Recognition*. In Proceedings of the 2018 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, 2018.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described with its name, description, and full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
