To extract datasets from the research paper titled "VisualWebBench: How Far Have Multimodal LLMs Evolved in Web Page Understanding and Grounding?" by Junpeng Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** to get an overview of the paper's objectives and the datasets that may be referenced. The abstract mentions the introduction of **VisualWebBench**, which is a multimodal benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs across various web tasks. This indicates that there may be a dataset associated with this benchmark.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology or experiments sections**. In this case, the paper describes **VisualWebBench** as comprising **1.5K human-curated instances from 139 real websites**, covering **87 sub-domains**. This suggests that the dataset is extensive and well-defined.

I will also check the **related work section** to see if any other datasets are mentioned that might be relevant to the benchmark or the tasks it encompasses. The authors reference existing benchmarks and datasets, but the primary focus remains on **VisualWebBench**.

In the **experiments section**, the authors evaluate various MLLMs on the **VisualWebBench** dataset, which confirms its significance in the context of the paper. The tasks outlined in the benchmark include captioning, webpage QA, heading OCR, element OCR, element grounding, action prediction, and action grounding, all of which utilize the instances from the **VisualWebBench** dataset.

Now, I will compile the full citation for the **VisualWebBench** dataset as it is the primary dataset discussed in the paper. The citation is as follows:

- For **VisualWebBench**, the citation is:
  > Junpeng Liu, Yifan Song, Bill Yuchen Lin, Wai Lam, Graham Neubig, Yuanzhi Li, Xiang Yue. *VisualWebBench: How Far Have Multimodal LLMs Evolved in Web Page Understanding and Grounding?* Preprint, 2024. URL: https://visualwebbench.github.io/

After gathering this information, I will summarize the dataset details and ensure that the citation is included in the final output. This structured approach ensures that I accurately capture the relevant datasets and their citations from the research paper.
