To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Correlation-Driven Multi-Level Multimodal Learning for Anomaly Detection on Multiple Energy Sources" by Taehee Kim and Hyuk-Yoon Kwon, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and dataset sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on real-world datasets consisting of multiple energy sources, which suggests that datasets are present.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Dataset)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention three datasets:

1. **AMPds2**: This dataset includes three types of energy sources: power, gas, and water, collected from a single household in Canada. It contains 1,051,200 records observed at minute intervals from April 2012 to March 2014. The dataset is referenced with a DOI link.

2. **4-ECK-2021**: This dataset includes four types of energy sources: power, water, hot water, and heating. It has 47,117 records observed at 15-minute intervals from January 2020 to March 2021. The authors mention that a non-correlated energy source (heating) was excluded to create a new dataset called 3-ECK-2021.

3. **5-ECK-2022**: This dataset includes five types of energy sources: electricity, gas, water, hot water, and heating. It has 13,584 records observed at one-hour intervals from August 2020 to February 2022. The authors also mention the creation of 3-ECK-2022 and 4-ECK-2022 by excluding non-correlated energy sources.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **AMPds2**, the citation is:
  > "Almanac of Minutely Power dataset (AMPds2). DOI: https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/FIE0S4."

- For **4-ECK-2021**, the citation is:
  > "Four types of Energy Consumption in Korea (4-ECK-2021). DOI: https://doi.org/10.17632/m68xz4w4t9.2."

- For **5-ECK-2022**, the citation is:
  > "Five types of Energy Consumption in Korea (5-ECK-2022). DOI: https://doi.org/10.17632/m68xz4w4t9.2."

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will prepare to format this information according to the required structure for further processing or review.
