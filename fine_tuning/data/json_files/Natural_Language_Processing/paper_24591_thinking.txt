To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Robust Low-Cost Drone Detection and Classification Using Convolutional Neural Networks in Low SNR Environments" by Stefan Glüge et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that a comprehensive dataset is provided for model development, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **Materials** and **Data Preparation** sections, as these are likely to contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the study. In the **Materials** section, the authors mention the **development dataset** and provide a link to it, which is crucial for citation purposes. They also refer to various datasets in a table format, which will help in identifying the datasets used.

In the **Data Preparation** section, the authors describe the process of creating the **noisy drone RF signals dataset**. They mention that this dataset consists of non-overlapping signal vectors mixed with noise, which is essential for understanding its structure and purpose.

I will also check the **References** section to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper references several datasets, including:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and that the full citations are included. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research, ready for further processing or review.
