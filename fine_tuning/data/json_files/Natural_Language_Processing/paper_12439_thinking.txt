To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Sequential Quadratic Programming-based Iterative Learning Control for Nonlinear Systems" by Samuel Balula et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and case study sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, but it may not contain detailed information about datasets. The introduction may also provide context but is unlikely to list datasets directly.

Next, I will focus on **Section IV (Case Study)**, as this section is likely to contain specific details about the datasets used in the experiments. In this section, the authors describe a 2-axis high precision motion system and mention three different models (LM, NL1, NL2) used for simulations. However, I need to determine if these models correspond to datasets or if they are simply representations of the system.

I will also look for any references to experimental data collected from the motion system, as this could indicate the presence of a dataset. The authors mention that they collected experimental data to build the models, which suggests that there is a dataset involved.

After identifying potential datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations related to the datasets or models mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to ensure that the datasets can be accurately referenced in future work.

In this paper, the authors refer to a previous work for a detailed description of the system and model design, specifically citing:
- **Balula et al. (2022)** for the data-driven reference trajectory optimization for precision motion systems. The citation is:
  > S. Balula, D. Liao-McPherson, A. Rupenyan, and J. Lygeros, “Data-driven reference trajectory optimization for precision motion systems,” arXiv preprint arXiv:2205.15694, 2022.

This citation indicates that the dataset used for the simulations may be detailed in this referenced work.

Now, I will summarize the findings regarding the datasets:
1. **Models Used**: LM (Linear Model), NL1 (Nonlinear ANN Model), NL2 (Ground Truth Nonlinear ANN Model). While these are not datasets in the traditional sense, they represent the models used in the experiments.
2. **Experimental Data**: The authors collected experimental data from the 2-axis precision motion system, which is implied to be a dataset but not explicitly named.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset or model is clearly documented along with its full citation for future reference. This will facilitate easy access to the datasets for further research or validation.
