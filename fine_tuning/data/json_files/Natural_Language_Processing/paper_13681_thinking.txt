To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The Daunting Dilemma with Sentence Encoders: Success on Standard Benchmarks, Failure in Capturing Basic Semantic Properties" by Yash Mahajan et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions evaluating five sentence encoders on the **SentEval benchmark**, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Evaluation on SentEval Benchmarks)**, where the authors list the datasets used for evaluation. They mention seven datasets from the SentEval benchmark:

1. **MR (Movie Review)**: A dataset for sentiment binary classification (Pang and Lee, 2005).
2. **CR (Customer Review)**: A sentiment prediction dataset on product reviews (Hu and Liu, 2004).
3. **MPQA (Multi-Perspective Question Answering)**: An opinion polarity dataset (Wiebe et al., 2005).
4. **SSTb (Stanford Sentiment Treebank)**: A dataset with binary labels for sentiment analysis (Socher et al., 2013).
5. **SUBJ (Subjectivity)**: A dataset for subjective prediction from movie reviews (Pang and Lee, 2004).
6. **TREC (Text REtrieval Conference)**: A fine-grained question-type classification dataset (Li and Roth, 2002a).
7. **MRPC (Microsoft Research Paraphrase Corpus)**: A dataset from parallel news sources (Li and Roth, 2002b).

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
