To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Exploring ChatGPT’s Capabilities on Vulnerability Management" by Peiyu Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract indicates that the authors used a **large-scale dataset containing 70,346 samples** for their evaluation, which suggests that there are specific datasets used for the various tasks discussed in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 2.1 (Vulnerability Management Process)** and **section 4 (Evaluation Results)**, where the authors likely detail the datasets used for each of the six vulnerability management tasks. In **Table 1**, the authors list the tasks along with their corresponding datasets, which is crucial for my extraction process.

The datasets mentioned in the paper are as follows:

1. **iTAPE Dataset**: Used for bug report summarization, containing 33,438 samples and 6,176,326 tokens.
   - Citation: 
     > Songqiang Chen, Xiaoyuan Xie, Bangguo Yin, Yuanxiang Ji, Lin Chen, and Baowen Xu. *Stay professional and efficient: automatically generate titles for your bug reports*. In Proceedings of the 35th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Automated Software Engineering, pages 385–397, 2020.

2. **Farsec Dataset**: Used for security bug report identification, containing 22,970 samples and 5,686,564 tokens.
   - Citation:

3. **DiffCVSS Dataset**: Used for vulnerability severity evaluation, containing 1,642 samples and 82,397 tokens.
   - Citation: 
     > Qiushi Wu, Yue Xiao, Xiaojing Liao, and Kangjie Lu. *OS-aware vulnerability prioritization via differential severity analysis*. In 31st USENIX Security Symposium (USENIX Security 22), pages 395–412, 2022.

4. **LLMset Dataset**: Used for vulnerability repair, containing 12 samples with various token counts.
   - Citation: 
     > Hammond Pearce, Benjamin Tan, Baleegh Ahmad, Ramesh Karri, and Brendan Dolan-Gavitt. *Examining zero-shot vulnerability repair with large language models*. In 2023 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy (SP), pages 2339–2356. IEEE, 2023.

5. **PatchNet Dataset**: Used for stable patch classification, containing 10,896 samples and 6,854,217 tokens.
   - Citation: 
     > Thong Hoang, Julia Lawall, Yuan Tian, Richard J Oentaryo, and David Lo. *Patchnet: Hierarchical deep learning-based stable patch identification for the linux kernel*. IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, 47(11):2471–2486, 2021.

After identifying these datasets, I will ensure that I have the correct citations for each dataset as they are critical for proper attribution in any subsequent analysis or reporting.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that can be used for further processing or review, ensuring that all necessary details are included for each dataset.
