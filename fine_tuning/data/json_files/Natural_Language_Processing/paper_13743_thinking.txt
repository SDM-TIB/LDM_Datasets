To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Neurons in Large Language Models: Dead, N-gram, Positional" by Elena Voita et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, and the introduction often outlines the datasets used in the study. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or data sources.

Next, I will move to the **Data and Setting** section, which is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets used in the experiments. In this section, the authors mention using data from diverse sources, including subsets of the validation and test parts of the Pile dataset, Reddit, and Codeparrot. I will note these datasets and any relevant details provided.

Specifically, I will identify the following datasets mentioned in the paper:

1. **The Pile**: This dataset is referenced as containing development splits used in the training of the OPT models. The authors mention subsets from various sources within The Pile, such as Wikipedia and DM Mathematics.

2. **Reddit**: The authors refer to the Pushshift Reddit dataset, which is a collection of preprocessed comments from Reddit.

3. **Codeparrot**: This dataset is mentioned as a source of code data used in the experiments.

Additionally, I will check the **References** section to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations I will extract are:

- For **The Pile**:
  > Leo Gao, Stella Biderman, Sid Black, Laurence Golding, Travis Hoppe, Charles Foster, Jason Phang, Horace He, Anish Thite, Noa Nabeshima, Shawn Presser, and Connor Leahy. *The pile: An 800gb dataset of diverse text for language modeling*. 2020.

- For **Pushshift Reddit dataset**:
  > Jason Baumgartner, Savvas Zannettou, Brian Keegan, Megan Squire, and Jeremy Blackburn. *The pushshift reddit dataset*. 2020.

- For **Codeparrot**:
  > The Codeparrot dataset is hosted on Hugging Face, and the citation is:
  > *Codeparrot: A dataset for code generation*. Available at: https://huggingface.co/datasets/codeparrot/codeparrot-clean.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This structured approach will help in accurately documenting the datasets used in the research paper.
