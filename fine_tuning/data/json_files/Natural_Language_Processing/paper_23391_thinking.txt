To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Adaptive Fusion Bank for Multi-modal Salient Object Detection" by Kunpeng Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments on three RGBT datasets and seven RGBD datasets. This indicates that there are multiple datasets involved, and I need to identify their names and details.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** within the paper, which is often where authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used in their experiments. In this case, I will focus on sections that discuss the datasets used for evaluation, which may include specific characteristics, sizes, and any relevant annotations.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors explicitly mention the following datasets:

1. **RGBD Datasets**:
   - **DUT-RGBD Dataset**: This dataset is referenced as a challenging RGBD dataset used in their experiments.
   - **NJUD Dataset**: Another RGBD dataset mentioned for evaluation.
   - **NLPR Dataset**: Also included in the RGBD datasets used for testing.
   - **SIP Dataset**: Mentioned as part of the RGBD datasets.
   - **SSD Dataset**: Another RGBD dataset utilized in the experiments.
   - **STERE Dataset**: Included in the RGBD datasets.
   - **ReDWeb-S Dataset**: The last RGBD dataset mentioned.

2. **RGBT Datasets**:
   - **VT821 Dataset**: One of the RGBT datasets used in the experiments.
   - **VT1000 Dataset**: Another RGBT dataset referenced.
   - **VT5000 Dataset**: The last RGBT dataset mentioned for evaluation.

Next, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each of these datasets. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide complete information for future researchers.

The full citations I find are as follows:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or processing.
