To extract datasets from the research paper titled "From Alexnet to Transformers: Measuring the Non-linearity of Deep Neural Networks with Affine Optimal Transport" by Quentin Bouniot et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention that they provide extensive experimental results, which suggests that datasets are involved. I will look for specific names of datasets or references to well-known datasets in the field of deep learning and computer vision.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental section** (Section 4), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and any relevant details about their use in the experiments.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention the **Imagenet dataset** as the primary dataset used for their experiments. They state that they trained and evaluated various models on the Imagenet dataset, which consists of 1,000 output categories.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Imagenet dataset. The citation for the Imagenet dataset is as follows:
> Russakovsky, O., Deng, J., Su, H., Krause, J., Satheesh, S., Ma, S., Huang, Z., Karpathy, A., Khosla, A., Bernstein, M., Berg, A. C., and Fei-Fei, L. (2015). *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 115(3):211â€“252.

Since the paper primarily discusses the Imagenet dataset, I will create an entry for it.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and full citation, ensuring that all necessary details are included for clarity and reference.
