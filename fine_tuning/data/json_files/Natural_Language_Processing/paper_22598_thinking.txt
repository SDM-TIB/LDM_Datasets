To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On the Adversarial Robustness of Learning-based Image Compression Against Rate-Distortion Attacks" by Chenhao Wu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus, and the introduction often outlines the context and previous work, which may include references to datasets.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the need for rigorous verification of learning-based image compression algorithms against adversarial attacks. They mention that their experiments are conducted on various algorithms, which suggests that datasets are involved, but I need to find specific names.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors explicitly mention using the **Kodak dataset** for evaluating the attack and defense mechanisms. The Kodak dataset is described as containing 24 full-color images with a resolution of 512 × 768. This is a clear identification of a dataset used in their experiments.

Additionally, the authors mention that adversarial training is performed on a larger set of **14,500 pictures** sourced from the web, but they do not provide a specific name for this dataset. Since it is not a well-defined dataset like Kodak, I will note it as a general dataset used for training.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Kodak dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Franzen, R. "True color kodak images." Available at: https://r0k.us/graphics/kodak/, November 1999.

Since the paper does not provide a formal citation for the 14,500 pictures dataset, I will not include it in the final output.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format, ensuring that the full citation for the Kodak dataset is included.

In summary, the identified datasets are:
1. **Kodak dataset**: Contains 24 full-color images with a resolution of 512 × 768.
   - Citation: Franzen, R. "True color kodak images." Available at: https://r0k.us/graphics/kodak/, November 1999.

I will now prepare the dataset entries for output.
