To extract datasets from the research paper titled "QUALEVAL: Qualitative Evaluation for Model Improvement" by Vishvak Murahari et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that QUALEVAL is evaluated on multiple datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental setup section** (Section 3), where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they list three datasets:

1. **MBPP (Austin et al., 2021)**: This dataset is used for program synthesis tasks, specifically generating Python programs from prompts.
2. **DialogSum (Chen et al., 2021)**: This dataset is utilized for dialogue summarization tasks, where the goal is to summarize conversations.
3. **MMLU (Hendrycks et al., 2020)**: This dataset is a multiple-choice question answering dataset, and the authors specify that they use the clinical knowledge split for their experiments.

I will then verify the details of these datasets in the **references section** to ensure I have the correct full citations for each:

- For **MBPP**, the citation is:
  > Jacob Austin, Augustus Odena, Maxwell Nye, Maarten Bosma, Henryk Michalewski, David Dohan, Ellen Jiang, Carrie Cai, Michael Terry, Quoc Le, et al. *Program synthesis with large language models*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2108.07732, 2021.

- For **DialogSum**, the citation is:
  > Yulong Chen, Yang Liu, Liang Chen, and Yue Zhang. *Dialogsum: A real-life scenario dialogue summarization dataset*. In Findings of the Association for Computational Linguistics: ACL-IJCNLP 2021, pages 5062â€“5074, 2021.

- For **MMLU**, the citation is:
  > Dan Hendrycks, Collin Burns, Steven Basart, Andy Zou, Mantas Mazeika, Dawn Song, and Jacob Steinhardt. *Measuring massive multitask language understanding*. In International Conference on Learning Representations, 2020.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
