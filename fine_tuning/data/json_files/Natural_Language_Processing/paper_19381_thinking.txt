To extract datasets from the research paper titled "RITFIS: Robust Input Testing Framework for LLMs-based Intelligent Software" by Mingxuan Xiao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the need for robustness testing of LLM-based software and hints at the use of datasets for empirical validation. The introduction elaborates on various applications of LLMs, but I need to look for specific datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will examine the **methodology** and **experimental setup** sections, as these typically contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used for testing. In the experimental setup, the authors mention conducting experiments on three datasets: 

1. **Financial Sentiment Analysis Dataset**: This dataset is used for evaluating the robustness of LLMs in the context of financial sentiment analysis.
2. **Movie Review Dataset (MR)**: This dataset is commonly used for sentiment analysis tasks, providing a benchmark for evaluating model performance.
3. **AG's News Dataset**: This dataset is utilized for news classification tasks, encompassing multiple categories of news articles.

I will then confirm the details of these datasets by checking the **results and analysis** section, where the authors present performance metrics for the testing methods applied to these datasets. This will help ensure that I have accurately identified the datasets used in their experiments.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations I will look for are:

- For the **Financial Sentiment Analysis Dataset**, I will search for the original paper or source that introduced this dataset.
- For the **Movie Review Dataset (MR)**, the citation is:
  > M. Hu and B. Liu, “Mining and summarizing customer reviews,” in Proceedings of the ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, pp. 168–177, 2004.
  
- For the **AG's News Dataset**, the citation is:
  > X. Zhang, J. Zhao, and Y. LeCun, “Character-level convolutional networks for text classification,” Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, vol. 28, 2015.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, into a structured format for easy reference and further processing. This ensures that I have accurately captured all necessary details regarding the datasets used in the research paper.
