To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Minimal Input Structural Modifications for Strongly Structural Controllability" by Geethu Joseph et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, but it may not contain detailed information about datasets. Therefore, I will pay close attention to the introduction and methodology sections, where the authors typically describe their experimental setup and the datasets used.

Next, I will look for any specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments or results sections**. These sections often contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used for evaluation, including their characteristics and how they were utilized in the study. If the authors mention any datasets, I will note their names and any relevant details provided.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** of the paper to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. I will ensure that I capture the complete citation format as presented in the references.

If the paper does not provide full citations for the datasets, I may need to conduct a brief search to find the original sources of the datasets mentioned. This may involve looking up the dataset names in academic databases or repositories to find the appropriate citations.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset information in a structured format for easy reference, making sure to include all relevant details for each dataset extracted from the paper.
