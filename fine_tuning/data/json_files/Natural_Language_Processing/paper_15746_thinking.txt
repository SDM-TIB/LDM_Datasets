To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Identifying Linearly-Mixed Causal Representations from Multi-Node Interventions" by Simon Bing et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the focus on causal representation learning and the use of multi-environment data, which suggests that datasets may be involved. However, it does not specify any datasets directly.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section 4) closely, as this is typically where datasets are detailed. In this section, the authors describe their empirical evidence and mention using synthetic data generated from structural causal models (SCMs). They also discuss the generation of interventional data across different environments, but they do not reference any publicly available datasets.

Since the paper primarily discusses synthetic data generated for their experiments, I will note that there are no external datasets cited. However, I will still look for any references to datasets in the **references section**. 

Upon reviewing the references, I will check if any of the cited works provide datasets that could be relevant to the research. For instance, the authors reference several papers that might have associated datasets, such as those by Ahuja et al. (2023) and Lachapelle et al. (2023). I will need to verify if these papers include datasets and provide their full citations.

After gathering all relevant information, I will compile the findings. Since the paper does not explicitly mention any datasets, I will note that the primary data used is synthetic and generated for the purpose of the experiments. If I find any datasets from the references, I will include their full citations.

Finally, I will summarize my findings, ensuring that I clearly state the absence of external datasets while providing any relevant citations from the references that may lead to datasets used in related works.
