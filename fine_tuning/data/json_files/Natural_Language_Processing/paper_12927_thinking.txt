To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Context Interest Network for Click-Through Rate Prediction" by Xuyang Hou et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors built a **31-day industrial dataset from their online advertising system**, which contains over 1 billion samples. This indicates that there is a significant dataset involved, but I need to find more specific details.

Next, I will look at **section 3.1.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors provide more information about the dataset. They describe how they split the data from the first 30 days as the training set and the last day as the testing set. This section confirms the existence of a dataset but does not provide a formal citation.

Since the dataset is derived from their own online advertising system, I will note that it is not a publicly available dataset and does not have a formal citation like other datasets might. However, I will still document it as a dataset used in their research.

Now, I will check the **References section** to see if there are any other datasets mentioned that might be relevant. However, the references primarily cite other works and do not mention additional datasets used in their experiments.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the findings:

1. **31-day Industrial Dataset**: This dataset is built from the authors' online advertising system, containing over 1 billion samples. It is split into a training set (first 30 days) and a testing set (last day). Since this dataset is proprietary and not publicly available, it does not have a formal citation.

Now, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format for clarity, ensuring that I include the necessary details about the dataset, even if it lacks a formal citation. This will help in documenting the datasets used in the research effectively.
