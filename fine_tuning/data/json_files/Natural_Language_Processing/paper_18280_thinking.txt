To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MambaByte: Token-free Selective State Space Model" by Junxiong Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors benchmark their model on several long-form text datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed used in their experiments. I will look for specific names of these datasets.

Next, I will proceed to the **experimental setup section** (section 4), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for training and evaluation. In this section, they mention five datasets:

1. **PG19**: This dataset is described as an extensive collection of full-length English books from the Project Gutenberg online library, specifically those written before 1919.

2. **Stories**: A subset of the CommonCrawl data used for commonsense reasoning and language modeling.

3. **Books**: Another collection of English books, similar to PG19.

4. **ArXiv**: This dataset consists of technical publications in LaTeX format from the arXiv online archive.

5. **Code**: A large dataset of publicly available open-source code.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **PG19**, the citation is:
  > Jack W. Rae, Anna Potapenko, Siddhant M. Jayakumar, Chloe Hillier, and Timothy P. Lillicrap. *Compressive Transformers for Long-Range Sequence Modelling*. In International Conference on Learning Representations, 2020.

- For **Stories**, the citation is:
  > Trieu H. Trinh and Quoc V. Le. *A Simple Method for Commonsense Reasoning*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1806.02847, 2018.

- For **Books**, the citation is:
  > Leo Gao, Stella Biderman, Sid Black, Laurence Golding, Travis Hoppe, Charles Foster, Jason Phang, Horace He, Anish Thite, Noa Nabeshima, Shawn Presser, and Connor Leahy. *The Pile: An 800GB Dataset of Diverse Text for Language Modeling*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2101.00027, 2020.

- For **ArXiv**, the citation is:
  > Leo Gao, Stella Biderman, Sid Black, Laurence Golding, Travis Hoppe, Charles Foster, Jason Phang, Horace He, Anish Thite, Noa Nabeshima, Shawn Presser, and Connor Leahy. *The Pile: An 800GB Dataset of Diverse Text for Language Modeling*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2101.00027, 2020.

- For **Code**, the citation is:
  > Leo Gao, Stella Biderman, Sid Black, Laurence Golding, Travis Hoppe, Charles Foster, Jason Phang, Horace He, Anish Thite, Noa Nabeshima, Shawn Presser, and Connor Leahy. *The Pile: An 800GB Dataset of Diverse Text for Language Modeling*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2101.00027, 2020.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
