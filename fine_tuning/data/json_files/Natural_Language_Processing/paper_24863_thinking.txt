To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Survey of Data Synthesis Approaches" by Hsin-Yu Chang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections that discuss data synthesis techniques**. The abstract provides a general overview of the paper's focus on synthetic data techniques, but I need to look for specific datasets mentioned in the body of the paper.

Next, I will examine **section 2 (Augmentation Objectives)** and **section 3 (Augmentation Approaches)**, as these sections may reference specific datasets used in the context of synthetic data generation and augmentation. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or references to prior works that may have utilized specific datasets.

In **section 4 (Post-processing)**, the authors discuss various techniques for evaluating synthetic data, which may include references to datasets used for testing these techniques. I will pay close attention to any examples or case studies that might mention specific datasets.

After identifying potential datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for the datasets used in the research.

If I find datasets mentioned, I will ensure to note down their names and the corresponding citations. For example, if the paper references a dataset like "ImageNet" or "CIFAR-10," I will look up the full citation for these datasets to include in my final output.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset names along with their full citations into a structured format for clarity and ease of use.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and cite the datasets discussed in the paper, maintaining the integrity of the research and providing valuable resources for future studies.
