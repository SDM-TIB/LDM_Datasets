To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Stabilizing Policy Gradients for Stochastic Differential Equations via Consistency with Perturbation Process" by Xiangxin Zhou et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors evaluate their algorithm on the **CrossDocked2020 dataset**, which is a clear indication that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for any additional context or mentions of datasets. The introduction discusses the application of their method in structure-based drug design and references the CrossDocked2020 dataset again, confirming its significance in their experiments.

I will then look into the **experiments** section, specifically focusing on the **experimental setup** subsection. Here, the authors provide details about the dataset used for training and testing. They mention using **100,000 pocket-ligand pairs for training** and **100 pockets for testing**, which gives insight into the dataset's structure and purpose.

In the **results** section, the authors summarize their findings based on the dataset, reinforcing the importance of the CrossDocked2020 dataset in their evaluation metrics.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the CrossDocked2020 dataset. The citation provided is:
> Francoeur, P. G., Masuda, T., Sunseri, J., Jia, A., Iovanisci, R. B., Snyder, I., and Koes, D. R. *Three-dimensional convolutional neural networks and a cross-docked data set for structure-based drug design*. Journal of chemical information and modeling, 60(9):4200â€“4215, 2020.

With this information, I can summarize the dataset extraction as follows:

1. **CrossDocked2020 Dataset**: This dataset is used for structure-based drug design, containing 100,000 pocket-ligand pairs for training and 100 pockets for testing. The dataset is crucial for evaluating the binding affinity of generated ligand molecules.

Now, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
