To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Language Modeling is Compression" by Grégoire Delétang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental evaluation sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's focus on the compression capabilities of large language models, which may hint at the datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experimental Evaluation)**, where the authors explicitly discuss the datasets used in their experiments. In this section, they mention three datasets:

1. **enwik9**: This dataset consists of the first 1 billion bytes of the English Wikipedia XML dump from March 3, 2006. It is commonly used to evaluate a model's ability to compress data. The authors note that it is an extension of the enwik8 dataset.

2. **ImageNet**: The ImageNet dataset contains 14,197,122 annotated images from the WordNet hierarchy and has been a benchmark for image classification and object detection since 2010. The authors describe how they processed the images to create a dataset of 1 GB.

3. **LibriSpeech**: This dataset includes approximately 1000 hours of 16kHz English speech data derived from audiobooks of the LibriVox project. The authors explain how they chunked the audio samples into 2048-byte segments to create a dataset of 1 GB.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **enwik9**, the citation is:
  > Hutter, M. (2006). *Universal Artificial Intelligence - Sequential Decisions Based on Algorithmic Probability*. Springer.

- For **ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Russakovsky, O., Deng, J., Su, H., Krause, J., Satheesh, S., Ma, S., Huang, Z., Karpathy, A., Khosla, A., Bernstein, M. S., Berg, A. C., & Fei-Fei, L. (2015). *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 115(3), 211-252.

- For **LibriSpeech**, the citation is:
  > Panayotov, V., Chen, G., Povey, D., & Khudanpur, S. (2015). *Librispeech: An ASR corpus based on public domain audio books*. In ICASSP.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
