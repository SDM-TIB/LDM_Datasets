To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Trustworthy Self-Attention: Enabling the Network to Focus Only on the Most Relevant References" by Yu Jing et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments, which suggests that datasets are involved, but I need to find specific names.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of occlusion information and reference points in optical flow estimation, but they do not explicitly mention datasets. I will continue to the **experiments section** for more details.

In **section 4.1 (Experimental Setup)**, the authors specify the datasets used for training and evaluation:

1. **Flying Chairs Dataset**: This dataset is referenced as being used for training. It is a well-known dataset for optical flow estimation tasks.
   
2. **Flying Things 3D Dataset**: This dataset is also mentioned as part of the training process. It is another popular dataset for optical flow estimation.

3. **Sintel Dataset**: The authors mention evaluating their method on the Sintel dataset, which is a standard benchmark for optical flow evaluation.

4. **KITTI Dataset**: This dataset is also referenced for evaluation purposes, particularly in the context of autonomous driving.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Flying Chairs Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Alexey Dosovitskiy, Philipp Fischer, Eddy Ilg, Philip Hausser, Caner Hazirbas, Vladimir Golkov, Patrick Van Der Smagt, Daniel Cremers, and Thomas Brox. *Flownet: Learning optical flow with convolutional networks*. In Proceedings of the IEEE international conference on computer vision, pages 2758–2766, 2015.

- For the **Flying Things 3D Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Nikolaus Mayer, Eddy Ilg, Philip Hausser, Philipp Fischer, Daniel Cremers, Alexey Dosovitskiy, and Thomas Brox. *A large dataset to train convolutional networks for disparity, optical flow, and scene flow estimation*. In Proceedings of the IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pages 4040–4048, 2016.

- For the **Sintel Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Daniel J Butler, Jonas Wulff, Garrett B Stanley, and Michael J Black. *A naturalistic open source movie for optical flow evaluation*. In Computer Vision–ECCV 2012: 12th European Conference on Computer Vision, Florence, Italy, October 7-13, 2012, Proceedings, Part VI 12, pages 611–625. Springer, 2012.

- For the **KITTI Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Moritz Menze and Andreas Geiger. *Object scene flow for autonomous vehicles*. In Proceedings of the IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pages 3061–3070, 2015.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
