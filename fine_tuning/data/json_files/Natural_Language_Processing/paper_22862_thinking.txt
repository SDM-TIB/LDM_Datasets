To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ReactXT: Understanding Molecular 'Reaction-ship' via Reaction-Contextualized Molecule-Text Pretraining" by Zhiyuan Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors propose a new dataset called **OpenExp** for experimental procedure prediction, which is a key focus of their work.

Next, I will look for detailed descriptions of the datasets in the **methodology section**. In this section, the authors describe the **OpenExp dataset**, which consists of 274,439 pairs of chemical reactions and their corresponding step-by-step instructions for experimental procedures. This dataset is compiled from the USPTO-Applications and the Open Reaction Database (ORD).

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The citations I need to gather are:

1. **USPTO-Applications**: This dataset is referenced as being compiled from records of chemical reactions and their corresponding applications published by the United States Patent and Trademark Office. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Lowe, D. (2017). *Chemical reactions from US patents (1976-Sep2016)*. 

2. **Open Reaction Database (ORD)**: This dataset is another source for the OpenExp dataset. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Kearnes, S. M., Maser, M. R., Wleklinski, M., Kast, A., Doyle, A. G., Dreher, S. D., Hawkins, J. M., Jensen, K. F., & Coley, C. W. (2021). *The open reaction database*. Journal of the American Chemical Society, 143(45), 18820â€“18826.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant datasets from the paper while adhering to the importance of providing full citations for each dataset.
