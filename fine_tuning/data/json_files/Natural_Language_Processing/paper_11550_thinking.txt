To extract datasets from the research paper titled "FHA-Kitchens: A Novel Dataset for Fine-Grained Hand Action Recognition in Kitchen Scenes" by Ting Zhe et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and dataset sections** of the paper. The abstract introduces the FHA-Kitchens dataset, highlighting its focus on fine-grained hand actions in kitchen scenes. This indicates that the dataset is central to the paper's contributions.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **introduction**. The authors discuss the need for a dataset that captures fine-grained hand actions, which confirms that FHA-Kitchens is the primary dataset being introduced.

In the **dataset section (Section 3)**, the authors provide detailed information about the FHA-Kitchens dataset, including its composition, the number of video clips (2,377), and the number of images (30,047). They also describe the annotation process, which includes high-quality labels for hand interaction regions and action triplets. This section is crucial as it contains the specifics of the dataset.

I will also check the **experiments section** to see if the authors mention any other datasets used for benchmarking or comparison. However, it appears that FHA-Kitchens is the main focus, and they benchmark various models on this dataset.

Now, I will gather the full citation for the FHA-Kitchens dataset. The paper does not provide a separate citation for the dataset itself, but it is essential to reference the paper as the source of the dataset. The citation for the paper is:

> Ting Zhe, Yongqian Li, Jing Zhang, Yong Luo, Han Hu, Bo Du, Yonggang Wen, Dacheng Tao. *FHA-Kitchens: A Novel Dataset for Fine-Grained Hand Action Recognition in Kitchen Scenes*. [arXiv preprint arXiv:XXXX.XXXX](https://arxiv.org/abs/XXXX.XXXX), 2023.

Since the FHA-Kitchens dataset is derived from the Kinetics dataset, I will also include the citation for the Kinetics dataset as it is mentioned in the paper:

> Joao Carreira, Eric Noland, Chloe Hillier, and Andrew Zisserman. *A short note on the kinetics-700 human action dataset*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1907.06987, 2019.

Finally, I will compile the extracted information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citations for both the FHA-Kitchens dataset and the Kinetics dataset. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets referenced in the paper.
