To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Combining Multiple Post-Training Techniques to Achieve Most Efficient Quantized LLMs" by Sayeh Sharify et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors benchmark their quantization methods on various models, which suggests that datasets are involved. I will look for specific names of datasets in these sections.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section 5) closely, as this is typically where datasets used for evaluation are detailed. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names and descriptions. The authors reference measuring perplexity on **WikiText-2**, which is a clear indication of a dataset being used.

In the **experiments section**, I will also check for any tables or figures that summarize the results of the experiments, as these often include the datasets used for evaluation. The paper mentions that the test split of the WikiText-2 dataset is used to evaluate the models, confirming its role as a dataset in their experiments.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citation for the WikiText-2 dataset. The citation for WikiText-2 is as follows:
> Merity, S., Xiong, C., Bradbury, J., & Socher, R. (2016). *Pointer sentinel mixture models*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1609.07843.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry for WikiText-2, ensuring to include its full citation.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry in a structured format, ready for any further processing or review.
