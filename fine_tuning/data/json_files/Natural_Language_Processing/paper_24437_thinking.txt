To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Unlocking the Future: Exploring Look-Ahead Planning Mechanistic Interpretability in Large Language Models" by Tianyi Men et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the exploration of planning mechanisms in large language models, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental setup section** where the authors describe their methodology. Here, they mention studying the **Blocksworld task** in a fully-observed setting. This indicates that they likely created or used a dataset related to this task.

In **Table 1**, which presents the dataset statistics, I find detailed information about the Blocksworld dataset, including the number of training and test samples across different levels (L1, L2, L3). The dataset is synthesized to contain optimal plans for the Blocksworld task, with specific statistics provided for each level.

Now, I will compile the information about the dataset:

1. **Blocksworld Dataset**: This dataset is synthesized for the Blocksworld task, containing optimal plans with varying levels of complexity. The dataset is divided into three levels (L1, L2, L3) with specific training and test sizes.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. However, since the dataset is synthesized by the authors themselves, it may not have a separate citation. Instead, I will note that the dataset is described in the paper itself.

The relevant citation for the paper is:
> Tianyi Men, Pengfei Cao, Zhuoran Jin, Yubo Chen, Kang Liu, Jun Zhao. *Unlocking the Future: Exploring Look-Ahead Planning Mechanistic Interpretability in Large Language Models*. In Proceedings of the [Conference Name], [Year].

Since the dataset is not published separately, I will reference the paper as the source of the dataset.

Finally, I will summarize the dataset information in a structured format, ensuring to include the citation for the paper as the source of the dataset.
