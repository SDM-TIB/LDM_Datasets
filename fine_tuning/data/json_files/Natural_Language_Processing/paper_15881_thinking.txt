To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Federated Learning with Manifold Regularization and Normalized Update Reaggregation" by Xuming An et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for experiments. The introduction often outlines the context and significance of the research, which may include references to specific datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for validation and testing. In this paper, the authors mention conducting experiments on **CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and TinyImageNet** datasets. I will take note of these datasets and any relevant details provided about them, such as their structure, size, and purpose.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide specific information about the datasets:
1. **CIFAR-10**: This dataset consists of 50,000 training images and 10,000 testing images, categorized into 10 classes.
2. **CIFAR-100**: Similar to CIFAR-10, but with 100 classes, each containing 600 images.
3. **TinyImageNet**: This dataset includes 100,000 training images and 10,000 testing images, categorized into 200 classes, with a resolution of 64x64 pixels.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:
- For **CIFAR-10** and **CIFAR-100**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton, et al. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical report, 2009.
  
- For **TinyImageNet**, the citation is:
  > A. Krizhevsky. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical report, 2009.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
