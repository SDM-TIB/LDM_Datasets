To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Automated Evaluation of Large Vision-Language Models on Self-driving Corner Cases" by Kai Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the creation of **CODA-LM**, which is described as a benchmark for evaluating LVLMs on self-driving corner cases. This indicates that there may be specific datasets referenced later in the paper.

Next, I will examine the **related work** section, where the authors discuss existing datasets relevant to autonomous driving. Here, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, their characteristics, and how they relate to the study. The authors reference several datasets, including **CODA**, **StreetHazards**, **nuScenes-QA**, **BDD-X**, **DRAMA**, and **DriveLM**.

I will then focus on the **dataset construction** section, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets they used. In this section, I will find:

1. **CODA**: A real-world road corner case dataset with 10,000 driving scenes, which is foundational for their work.
2. **StreetHazards**: A synthesized dataset for corner cases, which is also mentioned as part of their evaluation framework.
3. **nuScenes-QA**: A dataset that includes 460,000 question-answer pairs based on object attributes and relationships.
4. **BDD-X**: A dataset focusing on the behavior of the ego car.
5. **DRAMA**: A dataset that identifies critical targets and offers corresponding advice.
6. **DriveLM**: A dataset that promotes end-to-end autonomous driving understanding.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **references section** to gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets.

The full citations I will extract are:

- **CODA**:

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries along with their citations into a structured format for easy reference and further processing. This ensures that I have accurately captured all relevant datasets and their sources from the paper.
