To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Augmentation-Adapted Retriever Improves Generalization of Language Models as Generic Plug-In" by Zichun Yu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions experiments on the **MMLU** and **PopQA** datasets, indicating that these are key datasets used in the research.

Next, I will look into **section 4 (Experimental Methodologies)**, where the authors discuss their experimental setup. Here, they explicitly mention the datasets used for evaluation:

1. **MMLU (Massive Multitask Language Understanding)**: This dataset is described as a multitask language understanding dataset that includes 57 multi-choice question answering subtasks across various categories such as humanities, social sciences, and STEM.

2. **PopQA**: This is an entity-centric question answering dataset that focuses on long-tail questions.

In the **References section**, I will find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **MMLU**, the citation is:
  > Dan Hendrycks, Collin Burns, Steven Basart, Andy Zou, Mantas Mazeika, Dawn Song, and Jacob Steinhardt. *Measuring massive multitask language understanding*. In ICLR, 2021.

- For **PopQA**, the citation is:
  > Akari Asai, Timo Schick, Patrick Lewis, Xilun Chen, Gautier Izacard, Sebastian Riedel, Hannaneh Hajishirzi, and Wen-tau Yih. *Task-aware retrieval with instructions*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2211.09260, 2022.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
