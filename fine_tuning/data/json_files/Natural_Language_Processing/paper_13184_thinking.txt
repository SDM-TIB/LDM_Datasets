To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Breast Lesion Diagnosis Using Static Images and Dynamic Video" by Yunwen Huang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors validated their model on a breast ultrasound dataset composed of 897 sets of ultrasound images and videos. This suggests that a specific dataset is being used, which I need to detail.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experiments)**, where the authors provide more information about the dataset. They mention that the dataset consists of 897 sets of ultrasound images and videos, with a breakdown of 508 patients having malignant tumors and 389 patients having benign tumors. Each set includes several static images and a corresponding dynamic video.

Since the dataset is described but not formally named, I will look for any references or citations in the **References section** that might provide a formal citation for this dataset. However, it appears that the dataset is not attributed to a specific published source in the references provided. Therefore, I will note that the dataset is a custom dataset created for the study, and I will describe it accordingly.

Now, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format. The dataset entry will include the following details:

1. **Dataset Name**: Multi-Modality Breast Ultrasound Dataset
2. **Description**: A dataset composed of 897 sets of ultrasound images and videos, where 508 patients have malignant tumors and 389 patients have benign tumors. Each set contains several static images selected by radiologists and a corresponding dynamic video of the lesion.
3. **Citation**: Since there is no formal citation provided in the references, I will note that this dataset is a custom dataset created for the study.

Finally, I will ensure that I have accurately captured all relevant details and prepare to present the dataset information in the required format for further processing or review.
