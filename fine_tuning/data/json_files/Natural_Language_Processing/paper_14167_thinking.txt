To extract datasets from the research paper titled "EarnHFT: Efficient Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning for High Frequency Trading" by Molei Qin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may highlight key datasets used in the experiments. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets in relation to the research objectives.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (specifically section 5) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for testing their methods. In this section, I will look for any tables or figures that summarize dataset statistics, as well as any textual descriptions that provide details about the datasets, such as their names, characteristics, and the time periods they cover.

In this paper, the authors mention four datasets in section 5.1 (Datasets), which are summarized in Table 1. The datasets are:

1. **BTC/TUSD**: This dataset started on March 23, 2023, and is characterized by its unstable market trend.
2. **BTC/USDT**: This dataset has a longer trading history dating back to 2016 and is known for its stability.
3. **ETH/USDT**: This dataset is noted for its high liquidity and volatility, making it attractive for traders.
4. **GALA/USDT**: This dataset is recognized for its high volatility and is considered a niche trading pair.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations related to these datasets. If the datasets are derived from existing sources or previous studies, I will ensure to include those citations. 

For example, if the BTC/TUSD dataset is mentioned in a specific paper or report, I will cite that source accordingly. If the datasets are proprietary or not publicly available, I will note that as well.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including their names, descriptions, and citations, into a structured format that can be easily reviewed or processed further.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets used in the research paper, maintaining the integrity and traceability of the information.
