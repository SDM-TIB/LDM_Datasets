To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Self-supervised Interest Point Detection and Description for Fisheye and Perspective Images" by Marcela Mera-Trujillo et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors collected **two new datasets for additional training and testing**, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors discuss the challenges of keypoint detection and matching in hybrid camera scenarios. They mention the need for datasets that reflect these conditions, which reinforces the expectation that datasets will be described in detail.

In the **experiments section**, I will look for a subsection specifically dedicated to datasets. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **GTAV-Hybrid Dataset**: This dataset consists of 41,280 fisheye images, with 30,000 used for training and 600 for testing. It was generated using the Grand Theft Auto V (GTAV) game environment, capturing images with known calibration parameters.

2. **KITTI-360 Dataset**: This dataset includes a collection of images captured in urban environments, specifically 12,000 images for training and 4,000 images for testing, selected through a skip sampling approach.

3. **Evansdale Dataset**: A new dataset collected around the authors' campus, containing 30 pairs of fisheye and perspective images, which will also be made publicly available.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **GTAV-Hybrid Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Anh-Dzung Doan, Abdul Mohsi Jawaid, Thanh-Toan Do, and Tat-Jun Chin. *G2D: From GTA to Data*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1806.07381, 2018.

- For the **KITTI-360 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yiyi Liao, Jun Xie, and Andreas Geiger. *KITTI-360: A Novel Dataset and Benchmarks for Urban Scene Understanding in 2D and 3D*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2109.13410, 2021.

- For the **Evansdale Dataset**, since it is a new dataset created by the authors, it may not have a formal citation yet, but I will note that it will be made publicly available.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented and properly cited.
