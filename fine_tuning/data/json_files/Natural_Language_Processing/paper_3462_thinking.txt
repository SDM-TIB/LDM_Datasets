To extract datasets from the research paper titled "TAPAS at SemEval-2021 Task 9: Reasoning over tables with intermediate pre-training" by Thomas MÃ¼ller et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the datasets referenced. The abstract mentions the use of **TABFACT**, a large table entailment dataset, which indicates that this is one of the datasets I need to extract.

Next, I will look for specific sections that discuss datasets in detail, particularly the **Datasets** section, which is often where authors provide comprehensive information about the datasets used in their experiments. In this paper, the authors refer to the **SEMTABFACT** dataset, which is central to their work.

In the **System** section, the authors provide statistics about the SEMTABFACT dataset, indicating that it consists of statements and tables from scientific literature. They also mention that the training set contains only entailed and refuted statements, while the development and test sets include neutral statements as well. This information is crucial for understanding the dataset's structure and purpose.

I will also check the **References** section to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The citations are essential for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations I need to extract are:

1. For **SEMTABFACT**:
   > Nancy Xin Ru Wang, Diwakar Mahajan, Marina Danilevsky, and Sara Rosenthal. *SemEval-2021 Task 9: Fact verification and evidence finding for tabular data in scientific documents (SemTab-Facts)*. In Proceedings of the 15th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval-2021), 2021.

2. For **TABFACT**:
   > Wenhu Chen, Hongmin Wang, Jianshu Chen, Yunkai Zhang, Hong Wang, Shiyang Li, Xiyou Zhou, and William Yang Wang. *Tabfact: A large-scale dataset for table-based fact verification*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Learning Representations, 2020.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets, including their names, descriptions, and citations, ensuring that I provide a clear and concise overview of each dataset's relevance to the research presented in the paper. This will help in creating a structured output that can be used for further analysis or reference.
