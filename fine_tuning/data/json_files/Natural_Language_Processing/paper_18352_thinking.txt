To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SLICEGPT: Compress Large Language Models by Deleting Rows and Columns" by Saleh Ashkboos et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for evaluation. In this case, the abstract discusses the performance of SliceGPT on various models but does not explicitly name any datasets.

Next, I will examine the **introduction section** for any references to datasets. The introduction discusses the challenges of large language models and mentions the use of pre-trained models, but it does not specify any datasets.

Moving on to the **experiments section**, I will look for any subsections that detail the datasets used for training or evaluation. In this paper, the authors mention two calibration datasets: **WikiText-2** and **Alpaca**. 

1. **WikiText-2**: This dataset is used for language modeling and is mentioned as a calibration set for the experiments. It is a well-known dataset in the NLP community.

2. **Alpaca**: This dataset is also used for calibration in the experiments, specifically for recovery fine-tuning.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **WikiText-2**, the citation is:
  > Stephen Merity, Caiming Xiong, James Bradbury, and Richard Socher. *Pointer Sentinel Mixture Models*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1609.07843, 2016.

- For **Alpaca**, the citation is:
  > Rohan Taori, Ishaan Gulrajani, Tianyi Zhang, Yann Dubois, Xuechen Li, Carlos Guestrin, Percy Liang, and Tatsunori B. Hashimoto. *Stanford Alpaca: An Instruction-Following Llama Model*. https://github.com/tatsu-lab/stanford_alpaca, 2023.

With the dataset names and their citations identified, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and future reference. 

In summary, the datasets extracted from the paper are:
1. **WikiText-2** - Citation: Merity et al., 2016.
2. **Alpaca** - Citation: Taori et al., 2023.

This process ensures that I have accurately identified and documented the datasets used in the research, along with their proper citations.
