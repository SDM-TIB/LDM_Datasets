To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Transferability and explainability of deep learning emulators for regional climate model projections: Perspectives for future applications" by Jorge BaÃ±o-Medina et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of regional climate models (RCMs) and deep learning emulators, which suggests that datasets related to climate modeling may be involved.

Next, I will focus on the **Data and Methods section** where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention using simulations from the **ALADIN63 RCM** over Europe, which is provided by **EURO-CORDEX**. This indicates that I need to extract details about this dataset.

In this section, the authors specify that they use historical simulations (1980-2005) and future projections (2006-2100) under the RCP8.5 scenario. They also mention that the simulations are available from the **Earth System Grid Federation (ESGF)**. This is crucial information for citing the dataset.

I will also look for any references to specific datasets or papers that provide more details about the datasets used. The authors reference several studies and datasets, including the **CORDEX initiative**, which coordinates the generation of regional climate projections. 

Now, I will compile the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. **ALADIN63 RCM**: The citation for the ALADIN63 model is not explicitly provided in the text, but it is part of the EURO-CORDEX initiative. I will reference the CORDEX paper for context:
   > Jacob, D., et al. (2020). "Regional climate downscaling over Europe: perspectives from the EURO-CORDEX community." *Regional Environmental Change*, 20(2), 1-20.

2. **EURO-CORDEX**: The EURO-CORDEX initiative is mentioned as the source of the RCM simulations. The citation for the CORDEX initiative is:
   > Jacob, D., et al. (2020). "Regional climate downscaling over Europe: perspectives from the EURO-CORDEX community." *Regional Environmental Change*, 20(2), 1-20.

3. **Earth System Grid Federation (ESGF)**: The ESGF is mentioned as the repository for the datasets. The citation for ESGF is:
   > "Earth System Grid Federation." Available at: https://esgf.llnl.gov.

After gathering this information, I will ensure that I have accurately captured the relevant datasets and their citations for inclusion in the final output. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the study, along with their proper citations for reference.
