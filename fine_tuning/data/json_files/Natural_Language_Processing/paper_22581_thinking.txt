To extract datasets from the research paper titled "RobustMVS: Single Domain Generalized Deep Multi-view Stereo" by Hongbin Xu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors built a novel MVS domain generalization benchmark, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section V (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention several datasets:

1. **DTU (DT)**: This dataset is described as an indoor MVS dataset with 49 positions and varying light conditions. The authors specify the number of scenes used for training, validation, and testing.

2. **BlendedMVS (BL)**: This is a large-scale MVS dataset containing various scenes. The authors provide details about the number of scenes in the training and evaluation sets.

3. **GTASFM (GS)**: A synthetic dataset derived from the video game GTA-V, with specific details about the number of scenes in the training and test sets.

4. **Tanks&Temples (TT)**: This dataset is collected in outdoor scenes and includes information about the number of scenes in different evaluation sets.

5. **PASMVS (PA)**: A synthetic dataset with ground truth depth maps and camera parameters, used as an evaluation dataset.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **DTU**, the citation is:
  > R. Jensen, A. Dahl, G. Vogiatzis, E. Tola, and H. Aanæs. *Large scale multi-view stereopsis evaluation*. In Proceedings of the IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, 2014, pp. 406–413.

- For **BlendedMVS**, the citation is:

- For **GTASFM**, the citation is:
  > K. Wang and S. Shen. *Flow-motion and depth network for monocular stereo and beyond*. IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters, vol. 5, no. 2, pp. 3307–3314, 2020.

- For **Tanks&Temples**, the citation is:
  > A. Knapitsch, J. Park, Q.-Y. Zhou, and V. Koltun. *Tanks and temples: Benchmarking large-scale scene reconstruction*. ACM Transactions on Graphics (ToG), vol. 36, no. 4, pp. 1–13, 2017.

- For **PASMVS**, the citation is:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured all relevant details from the paper regarding the datasets used in the research.
