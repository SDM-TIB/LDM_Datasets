To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Graph Deep Learning for Time Series Forecasting" by Andrea Cini et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, I will look for specific names of datasets, their characteristics, and any relevant details such as the number of samples, features, and the context in which they were used.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find the following datasets mentioned:

1. **METR-LA**: This dataset consists of traffic measurements from loop detectors in the Los Angeles County Highway. It is characterized as having 34,272 time steps and 207 nodes.

2. **PEMS-BAY**: Similar to METR-LA, this dataset includes traffic data from the San Francisco Bay Area, with 52,128 time steps and 325 nodes.

3. **CER-E**: This dataset contains energy consumption readings aggregated into 30-minute intervals from 485 smart meters monitoring small and medium-sized enterprises.

4. **AQI**: The Air Quality Index dataset collects hourly measurements of pollutant PM2.5 from 437 air quality monitoring stations across various cities in China.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset from the **References section** of the paper. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

- For **METR-LA** and **PEMS-BAY**, the citation is:
  > Li, Y., Yu, R., Shahabi, C., & Liu, Y. (2018). Diffusion Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network: Data-Driven Traffic Forecasting. In International Conference on Learning Representations.

- For **CER-E**, the citation is:
  > Commission for Energy Regulation. (2016). CER Smart Metering Project - Electricity Customer Behaviour Trial, 2009-2010 [dataset]. Irish Social Science Data Archive. SN: 0012-00.

- For **AQI**, the citation is:
  > Zheng, Y., Yi, X., Li, M., Li, R., Shan, Z., Chang, E. (2015). Forecasting fine-grained air quality based on big data. In Proceedings of the 21st ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining.

After compiling this information, I will ensure that each dataset is clearly documented with its name, description, and citation, ready for inclusion in any structured output or further analysis.
