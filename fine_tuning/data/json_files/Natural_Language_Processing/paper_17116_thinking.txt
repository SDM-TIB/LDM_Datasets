To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Design Space Exploration of Low-Bit Quantized Neural Networks for Visual Place Recognition" by Oliver Grainge et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a general overview of the research focus, while the introduction often contextualizes the work and may mention datasets used in prior research.

Next, I will focus on **section III (Experimental Setup)**, which is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets used for training and testing the models. In this section, the authors explicitly mention the datasets:

1. **Mapillary Street Level Sequences Dataset**: This dataset is described as a diverse collection of over 1.6 million images that capture variations in illumination, viewpoint, appearance, and occlusions. This dataset is used for training the models.

2. **Nordlands Dataset**: This dataset is utilized for testing and is noted for assessing seasonal appearance changes.

3. **St Lucia Dataset**: Another testing dataset that focuses on illumination variations.

4. **Pittsburgh30k Dataset**: This dataset is also used for testing and is characterized by extreme viewpoint shifts.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

- For the **Mapillary Street Level Sequences Dataset**, the citation is:
  > F. Warburg, S. Hauberg, M. Lopez-Antequera, P. Gargallo, Y. Kuang, and J. Civera. *Mapillary street-level sequences: A dataset for lifelong place recognition*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), June 2020.

- For the **Nordlands Dataset**, the citation is:
  > D. Olid, J. M. Fácil, and J. Civera. *Single-view place recognition under seasonal changes*. In PPNIV Workshop at IROS 2018, 2018.

- For the **St Lucia Dataset**, the citation is:
  > M. J. Milford and G. F. Wyeth. *Mapping a suburb with a single camera using a biologically inspired slam system*. IEEE Transactions on Robotics, vol. 24, no. 5, pp. 1038–1053, 2008.

- For the **Pittsburgh30k Dataset**, the citation is:
  > R. Arandjelović, P. Gronat, A. Torii, T. Pajdla, and J. Sivic. *NetVLAD: CNN architecture for weakly supervised place recognition*. In IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2016.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
