To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The AI Assessment Scale (AIAS) in action: A pilot implementation of GenAI supported assessment," I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the implementation of the AIAS and its impact on academic misconduct and student attainment, which suggests that there may be relevant data or datasets involved.

Next, I will examine the **methodology and results sections** to see if the authors provide specific datasets or data sources used in their pilot study. I will look for any tables, figures, or references to datasets that may have been analyzed or collected during the study.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention specific data points related to academic misconduct and student performance, such as a 5.9% increase in student attainment and a 33.3% increase in module passing rates. However, they do not explicitly name any external datasets used for their analysis.

Since the paper focuses on the implementation of the AIAS at British University Vietnam (BUV) and does not reference any publicly available datasets, I will note that the data presented is likely derived from internal records of the university rather than external datasets.

I will also check the **References section** to see if any datasets are cited indirectly through the literature discussed in the paper. However, it appears that the references primarily consist of studies and articles discussing the implications of GenAI in education rather than specific datasets.

In conclusion, while the paper provides valuable insights into the effects of the AIAS, it does not explicitly mention any datasets that can be cited. Therefore, I will summarize the findings related to the internal data collected at BUV without providing external dataset citations, as none are available.

Overall, my extraction process confirms that there are no specific datasets to cite from this paper, but I will document the internal data findings as they relate to the AIAS implementation.
