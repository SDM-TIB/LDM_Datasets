To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Grasp Multiple Objects with One Hand" by Yuyang Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the creation of a synthetic dataset called **Grasp’Em**, which is a strong indicator that this dataset is central to the research.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly the parts where the authors describe their experimental setup and data generation. In the section discussing the dataset, the authors specify that **Grasp’Em** comprises 90,000 diverse multi-object grasps, including both single-object and dual-object configurations. This section provides crucial details about the dataset's size and the types of grasps it includes.

Additionally, I will look for any references to other datasets used in the study. The authors mention that the objects in the dataset are sourced from **YCB** and **ContactDB**. I will need to confirm the details of these datasets as well.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

1. **Grasp’Em Dataset**: The paper does not provide a specific citation for this dataset since it is introduced in the current work. However, I will note that it is a large-scale synthetic dataset created by the authors.

2. **YCB Dataset**: The citation for the YCB dataset is:
   > B. Calli, A. Singh, J. Bruce, A. Walsman, K. Konolige, S. Srinivasa, P. Abbeel, and A. M. Dollar. "Yale-CMU-Berkeley Dataset for Robotic Manipulation Research." *International Journal of Robotics Research*, vol. 36, no. 3, pp. 261–268, 2017.

3. **ContactDB**: The citation for the ContactDB dataset is:
   > S. Brahmbhatt, C. Ham, C. C. Kemp, and J. Hays. "ContactDB: Analyzing and Predicting Grasp Contact via Thermal Imaging." In *CVPR*, 2019.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

- **Grasp’Em**: A large-scale synthetic dataset comprising 90,000 diverse multi-object grasps, specifically designed for multi-object grasping research.
- **YCB Dataset**: A dataset used for robotic manipulation research, containing various objects for grasping tasks.
- **ContactDB**: A dataset focused on analyzing and predicting grasp contact, utilizing thermal imaging for data collection.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that each dataset is clearly identified with its respective citation.
