To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Best Practices for Machine Learning Systems: An Industrial Framework for Analysis and Optimization" by Kornel Kie≈Çczewski et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a high-level overview, and the introduction often outlines the context and relevance of the work, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments and results sections**. These sections typically contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used for evaluation, including their characteristics, size, and any preprocessing steps taken. I will look for specific mentions of datasets, including their names and any relevant details.

In this paper, I will pay particular attention to any tables or figures that may summarize the datasets or their properties. If the authors refer to datasets in the context of their methodology or results, I will note those references carefully.

Once I identify any datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

If the paper mentions datasets such as "internal practices" or "external sets," I will ensure to clarify whether these are actual datasets or just sets of practices. If they are datasets, I will extract their names and any relevant details.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as found in the References section. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.

Finally, I will summarize my findings in a structured format, ensuring clarity and completeness for anyone reviewing the datasets extracted from the paper.
