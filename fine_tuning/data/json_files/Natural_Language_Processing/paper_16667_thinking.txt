To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Learning a Generalist Model for Embodied Navigation" by Duo Zheng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on several benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental setup section** where the authors describe the datasets used for training and evaluation. In this section, they mention the following datasets:

1. **CVDN**: This dataset is used for cooperative vision-and-dialog navigation, requiring the agent to navigate based on dialog history. The authors provide a reference for this dataset.

2. **SOON**: This dataset is used for object navigation, where the agent must locate a described object based on rich semantic descriptions. The authors also provide a reference for this dataset.

3. **R2R**: This dataset requires the agent to navigate step-by-step according to instructions. It is mentioned as a key dataset in their experiments.

4. **REVERIE**: This dataset is used for localizing a distant target object based on high-level instructions. The authors reference this dataset as well.

5. **ScanQA**: This dataset is utilized for 3D question answering, and the authors mention it in the context of their experiments.

6. **LLaVA-23k**: This dataset is mentioned as part of the combined dataset used for training.

7. **Augmented data for R2R and REVERIE**: The authors mention that they also used augmented data derived from these datasets.

Now, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for each of these datasets:

- For **CVDN**, the citation is:

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations to ensure that they are properly documented and ready for further processing or review.
