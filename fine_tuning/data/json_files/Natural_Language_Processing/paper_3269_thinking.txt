To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Improving ENIGMA-Style Clause Selection While Learning From History" by Martin Suda, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors use a relevant subset of SMT-LIB for their experiments, which indicates that this is a dataset of interest. I will note this down as a potential dataset.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (Section 5) where the author discusses the data preparation and the specific problems used for training and evaluation. Here, the author states that they used a subset of 20,795 problems from the SMT-LIB library, which is crucial for my dataset extraction.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the SMT-LIB dataset. The SMT-LIB library is referenced as follows:
> Barrett, C., Fontaine, P., Tinelli, C. (2016). The Satisfiability Modulo Theories Library (SMT-LIB). www.SMT-LIB.org.

Now, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format. The identified dataset is:

1. **SMT-LIB Dataset**: This dataset consists of a collection of problems used for evaluating the performance of automatic theorem provers, specifically the Vampire prover in this case.

Finally, I will ensure that I have the full citation for the SMT-LIB dataset ready for inclusion in any structured output or documentation.

After completing these steps, I will have successfully extracted the relevant dataset from the paper along with its citation.
