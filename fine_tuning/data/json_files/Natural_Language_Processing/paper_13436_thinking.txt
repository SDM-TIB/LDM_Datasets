To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Class-constrained t-SNE: Combining Data Features and Class Probabilities" by Linhao Meng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any explicit references to datasets used for validation or experimentation.

Next, I will examine **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe their experimental setup. This section typically contains detailed information about the datasets used, including their characteristics and how they were utilized in the experiments. 

In **subsection 5.1 (A Synthetic Example)**, the authors mention a synthetic dataset created for validation purposes. They describe its structure, including the number of clusters and instances, but do not provide a formal citation since it is a synthetic dataset.

In **subsection 5.2 (Classifier Analysis)**, the authors use the **Fashion MNIST dataset**. They describe the dataset as consisting of grayscale images of 28x28 pixels, with a total of 4000 images selected for their study. The citation for this dataset is:
> Xiao, H., Rasul, K., & Vollgraf, R. (2017). *Fashion-MNIST: A novel image dataset for benchmarking machine learning algorithms*. CoRR, abs/1708.07747.

In **subsection 5.3 (Document Topic Analysis)**, the authors utilize the **IEEE VIS publication dataset**. They explain how they extracted abstracts and keywords from 3430 publications. The citation for this dataset is:
> Isenberg, P., Heimerl, F., Koch, S., Xu, P., Stolper, C., Sedlmair, M., Chen, J., MÃ¶ller, T., & Stasko, J. (2017). *vispubdata.org: A metadata collection about IEEE visualization (VIS) publications*. IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics, 23(9), 2199-2206. doi: 10.1109/TVCG.2016.2615308.

After identifying the datasets, I will ensure to compile the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper, as this is crucial for proper documentation and referencing.

Finally, I will summarize the findings in a structured manner, ensuring that each dataset is clearly identified along with its citation for easy reference in future work.
