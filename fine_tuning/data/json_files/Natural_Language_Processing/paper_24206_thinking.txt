To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Dynamic Asset Allocation with Asset-Specific Regime Forecasts" by Yizhan Shu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract discusses an empirical study on a multi-asset portfolio comprising twelve risky assets, which suggests that there are specific datasets related to these assets.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Asset Universe)**, where the authors provide a detailed overview of the assets included in their study. This section lists twelve risky assets and one risk-free asset, along with their corresponding index names and Bloomberg tickers. The assets mentioned are:

1. **US Large-Cap Equity (LargeCap)** - S&P 500 Total Return Index (SPTR)
2. **US Mid-Cap Equity (MidCap)** - S&P MidCap 400 Total Return Index (SPTRMDCP)
3. **US Small-Cap Equity (SmallCap)** - Russell 2000 Total Return Index (RU20INTR)
4. **Developed Markets ex-US Equity (EAFE)** - MSCI EAFE Net Total Return USD Index (NDDUEAFE)
5. **Emerging Markets Equity (EM)** - MSCI Emerging Net Total Return USD Index (NDUEEGF)
6. **US Aggregate Bonds (AggBond)** - Bloomberg US Aggregate Bond Total Return Index (LBUSTRUU)
7. **US Long Treasury Bonds (Treasury)** - Bloomberg US Long Treasury Total Return Index (LUTLTRUU)
8. **US Liquid High Yield Bonds (HighYield)** - iBoxx USD Liquid High Yield Total Return Index (IBOXHY)
9. **US Investment-Grade Corporate Bonds (Corporate)** - Bloomberg US Corporate Total Return Index (LUACTRUU)
10. **US Real Estate (REIT)** - Dow Jones US Real Estate Total Return Index (DJUSRET)
11. **Commodities (Commodity)** - Deutsche Bank DBIQ Optimum Yield Diversified Commodity Index Excess Return (DBLCDBCE)
12. **Gold (Gold)** - LBMA Gold Price PM USD (GOLDLNPM)

In addition to the asset names, the authors provide the corresponding tickers for actively traded ETFs that track these indices, which is crucial for identifying the datasets used in their analysis.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The references may include the original sources of the indices or any relevant papers that describe the datasets in detail.

For example, the citation for the S&P 500 Total Return Index could be:
> S&P Dow Jones Indices. *S&P 500 Total Return Index*. Available at: [S&P Dow Jones Indices website].

I will compile the full citations for each dataset based on the information provided in the paper and any additional sources I can find.

Finally, I will summarize the datasets in a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly identified with its name, description, and full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, facilitating further analysis or replication of the study.
