To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Robust Queue Length Estimation for Ramp Metering in a Connected Vehicle Environment" by Yu Tang, Kaan Ozbay, and Li Jin, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned or referenced. The abstract discusses the use of connected vehicles (CVs) and their data for traffic state estimation, which suggests that there may be datasets related to CVs or traffic measurements.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **introduction**. The authors mention that connected vehicles provide new data via vehicle-to-vehicle or vehicle-to-infrastructure communication, which indicates that they might be using datasets derived from these communications.

In the **methodology section**, I will pay close attention to any descriptions of data collection methods or specific datasets used in their experiments. The authors refer to Basic Safety Messages (BSMs) as a source of data, which is crucial for understanding the datasets involved.

I will also check the **case study section** to see if any specific datasets are used for simulations or experiments. The authors mention using a model developed with the microscopic traffic simulation software, SUMO, which may imply that they have utilized datasets from this simulation.

After identifying potential datasets, I will consult the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. For example, if the authors refer to datasets from previous studies or reports, I will ensure to extract the complete citation for each.

If the paper mentions specific datasets, such as traffic flow data or simulation data, I will note their details, including the dataset name, description, and any relevant metrics (e.g., number of vehicles, time intervals).

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, ensuring that I include full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and cite the datasets from the paper, which is essential for proper academic referencing and further research.
