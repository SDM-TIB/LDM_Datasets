To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A critical appraisal of water table depth estimation: Challenges and opportunities within machine learning" by Joseph Janssen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study and may mention key datasets used for analysis.

Next, I will focus on the **Methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the data sources. In this paper, the authors discuss various datasets used for modeling water table depth (WTD). I will look for specific mentions of datasets, including their names, descriptions, and any relevant details about their content or structure.

In the **Data section**, the authors describe the input variables and datasets used to develop their machine learning models. I will carefully note the following datasets:

1. **EMDNA Dataset**: This dataset provides daily precipitation and temperature data at a resolution of 0.1 degrees, which is crucial for calculating long-term average climatic attributes.

2. **TerraClimate Dataset**: This dataset is used to estimate potential and actual evapotranspiration, as well as maximum snow water equivalent, at a resolution of 0.04 degrees.

3. **SoilGrids Dataset**: A global-scale information system that provides high-resolution soil property maps, which are essential for understanding groundwater hydraulics.

4. **MODIS Land Cover Dynamics Product (MCD12Q)**: This dataset offers global land cover and phenology metrics at a 500-meter spatial resolution, which is important for understanding vegetation impacts on groundwater recharge.

5. **HydroLAKES Dataset**: This dataset provides polygonal representations of water bodies and is used to identify pixels representing the interior of permanently wet surface water bodies.

6. **Height Above Nearest Drainage (HAND) Dataset**: A global dataset used to approximate WTD in mountainous landscapes.

7. **USGS Groundwater Levels Database**: This dataset compiles water well observational information across the United States.

8. **Provincial Databases**: Various provincial databases in Canada that provide historical well reports and groundwater level data.

After identifying these datasets, I will consult the **References section** to retrieve full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access the datasets.

For example, the citation for the **EMDNA Dataset** might look like:
> Tang, G., Clark, M. P., Papalexiou, S. M., Newman, A. J., Wood, A. W., Brunet, D., & Whitfield, P. H. (2021). EMDNA: An ensemble meteorological dataset for North America. Earth System Science Data, 13(7), 3337â€“3362.

I will repeat this process for each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring that I capture all relevant details and citations.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that clearly presents the information for each dataset, including its name, description, and citation, ready for review or further processing.
