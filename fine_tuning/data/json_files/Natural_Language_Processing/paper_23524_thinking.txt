To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Operational Latent Spaces" by Scott H. Hawley and Austin R. Tackett, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly referenced. The abstract mentions the use of self-supervised learning and operational latent spaces, but it does not specify any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine **section 2 (Example 1: Mixing in Latent Space)**, where the authors discuss the MUSDB18 dataset. They describe how they use various stem components from this dataset to illustrate their method of mixing in latent space. This indicates that MUSDB18 is a key dataset for their experiments.

In **section 3 (Example 2: Enabling Rotations)**, the authors do not introduce any new datasets but continue to reference the concepts and methods related to the MUSDB18 dataset. Therefore, I will focus on this dataset for my extraction.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the MUSDB18 dataset. The relevant citation is:

- For **MUSDB18 Dataset**:
  > Zafar Rafii et al. *The MUSDB18 corpus for music separation*. Dec. 2017. doi: 10.5281/zenodo.1117372. URL: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1117372.

Since the paper primarily discusses the MUSDB18 dataset, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity.

Finally, I will ensure that I have accurately captured the dataset's name, description, and citation, ready for any further processing or review.
