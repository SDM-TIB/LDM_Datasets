To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Markov chain models for inspecting response dynamics in psychological testing" by Andrea Bosco, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, results, and discussion sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract provides a general overview, but I will focus on sections that are more likely to contain specific dataset information.

In the **introduction**, the author discusses the importance of psychological tests and mentions various methodologies but does not explicitly name any datasets. I will continue to the **methods section**, where the author describes the Four Factors Mind Wandering Questionnaire (4FMW) and its administration to students. This indicates that the 4FMW is a dataset used in the study.

Next, I will look for any specific details about the dataset in the **materials and methods section**. Here, the author states that the 4FMW was administered to three cohorts of undergraduate psychology students, totaling 100 students, with specific demographic details provided. This gives me a clear understanding of the dataset's context.

In the **results section**, the author discusses the analysis of the responses from the 4FMW, which further confirms its role as a dataset in the study. The author also mentions the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure and the Ultra-short screening list for ADHD in adults, indicating that these are additional datasets used for assessing signs of OCD and ADHD among participants.

Now, I will compile the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and reference:

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets in a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly identified along with its citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
