To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Progress and Opportunities of Foundation Models in Bioinformatics" by Qing Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a general overview of the paper's focus on foundation models (FMs) in bioinformatics, but I need to look for specific datasets.

Next, I will examine the **main body of the paper**, particularly sections that discuss specific applications of FMs in bioinformatics. I will look for mentions of datasets in the context of tasks such as sequence analysis, structure prediction, and function annotation. The authors may refer to datasets used for training or evaluating their models.

In the **results and discussion sections**, I will pay close attention to any tables or figures that summarize datasets or their characteristics. For instance, if there is a table that lists various biological problems alongside the datasets used to address them, this will be crucial for my extraction.

I will also check the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned in the paper. This is important for providing proper attribution and context for each dataset.

As I identify datasets, I will note the following details for each:
1. **Dataset Name**: The official name of the dataset.
2. **Description**: A brief description of the dataset, including its purpose and the type of data it contains (e.g., genomic sequences, protein structures).
3. **Citation**: The full citation of the original paper or source where the dataset can be found.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like "bpRNA," I would document it as follows:
- **Dataset Name**: bpRNA
- **Description**: A dataset containing 102,318 sequences from 2,588 RNA families used for RNA secondary structure prediction.
- **Citation**: Danaee P, Rouches M, Wiley M, Deng D, Huang L, and Hendrix D. *bpRNA: large-scale automated annotation and analysis of RNA secondary structure*. Nucleic acids research, 2018, 46(11): 5381-5394.

After gathering all relevant datasets, I will compile them into a structured format that includes all the necessary details for each dataset, ensuring that the citations are complete and accurate.

Finally, I will review the extracted information to ensure clarity and completeness before finalizing the dataset documentation.
