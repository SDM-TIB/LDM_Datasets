To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Revisiting the Information Capacity of Neural Network Watermarks: Upper Bound Estimation and Beyond" by Fangqi Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and the introduction often discusses the context and relevance of the research, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. This section is crucial as it usually contains detailed information about the datasets, including their names, sizes, and any specific characteristics relevant to the study.

I will also check the **related works section** to see if the authors reference any datasets that are commonly used in the field, which may not be explicitly detailed in the experiments section but are relevant to the context of their research.

Once I identify the datasets, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is important for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets themselves.

For example, if I find that the authors used the **CIFAR-10 dataset**, I would look for its citation in the references. The citation for CIFAR-10 is:
> Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical Report, 2009.

If the authors mention other datasets, such as **MNIST** or **ImageNet**, I will similarly find their citations:
- For MNIST:
  > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998.
  
- For ImageNet:
  > Olga Russakovsky, Jia Deng, Hao Sheng, et al. *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 115(3):211-252, 2015.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accompanied by its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, along with proper references for further exploration.
