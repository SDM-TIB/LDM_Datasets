To extract datasets from the research paper titled "BB-Patch: Blackbox Adversarial Patch-Attack Using Zeroth-Order Optimization," I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of a dataset for experiments, which indicates that datasets are present in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Dataset Description)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention three datasets:

1. **MNIST**: A well-known dataset containing 60,000 images of handwritten digits, each of size 28x28 pixels. This dataset is commonly used for training various image processing systems.

2. **CIFAR-10**: This dataset consists of 60,000 images in 10 classes, with each image being 32x32 pixels. It is widely used for benchmarking machine learning algorithms.

3. **Imagenet**: A large-scale dataset with 1.2 million images across 1,000 classes, with images typically sized at 299x299 pixels. It is a standard dataset for image classification tasks.

In the **experiments section**, the authors confirm that they used these datasets to evaluate the performance of their proposed BB-Patch method. This reinforces the relevance of the datasets mentioned.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **MNIST**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun and Corinna Cortes. *MNIST handwritten digit database*. 2010.

- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. *Cifar-10 (Canadian Institute for Advanced Research)*.

- For **Imagenet**, the citation is:
  > J. Deng, W. Dong, R. Socher, L. Li, Kai Li, and Li Fei-Fei. *Imagenet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In 2009 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 248â€“255, 2009.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will prepare the information for structured output or further analysis.
