To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MergeNet: Knowledge Migration across Heterogeneous Models, Tasks, and Modalities" by Kunxi Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on knowledge transfer across different models and tasks, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. The introduction may provide more context or specific references to datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will look into **section 4 (Experiments)**, as this section typically contains detailed information about the datasets used for evaluation. I will carefully read through the subsections, particularly **4.1 (Cross-Structural Knowledge Transfer)**, **4.2 (Cross-Modal Knowledge Transfer)**, and **4.3 (Cross-Task Knowledge Transfer)**, to identify any datasets that are explicitly named or described.

In **section 4.1**, the authors mention using the **CIFAR-100 dataset** for cross-structural knowledge transfer. This dataset is described as containing 100 categories with 50,000 training images and 10,000 validation images.

In **section 4.2**, the authors refer to two datasets for cross-modal knowledge transfer: **VQA v2.0** for Visual Question Answering and **MSCOCO** for Image-Text Retrieval. These datasets are crucial for evaluating the performance of the proposed method in different modalities.

In **section 4.3**, the authors discuss the **SQuAD v2.0** dataset for the question-answering task and the **IMDb** dataset for sentiment classification. These datasets are used to assess the effectiveness of cross-task knowledge transfer.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to retrieve the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

2. **VQA v2.0**:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
