To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Long-term Fairness in Ride-Hailing Platform" by Yufan Kang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments using a "publicly available real-world dataset," which indicates that a dataset is indeed utilized, but I need to find its specific name and details.

Next, I will look closely at the **experiments section** (Section 5) where the authors describe their methodology and datasets. In this section, they explicitly mention using the **New York City Taxi dataset**. I will note down the details provided about this dataset, including its characteristics and the time period covered.

The paper states that the dataset contains essential information on all requests executed by active taxis in New York City, including the day and time of requests, pickup and drop-off locations, and that the data is extracted for requests starting and ending within Manhattan from 01/03/2016 to 01/04/2016.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the New York City Taxi dataset. The paper provides a link to the dataset, which is crucial for proper citation. The citation for the dataset is as follows:
> New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission. *TLC Trip Record Data*. Available at: https://www.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page

Having gathered this information, I will summarize the dataset details as follows:

1. **New York City Taxi dataset**: A publicly available dataset containing information on all taxi requests in New York City, including pickup and drop-off locations, and timestamps for requests. The data is specifically extracted for requests occurring in Manhattan from 01/03/2016 to 01/04/2016.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and full citation, ensuring that all necessary details are accurately represented for future reference or processing.
