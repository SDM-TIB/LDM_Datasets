To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Safe Model-based Off-policy Reinforcement Learning for Eco-Driving in Connected and Automated Hybrid Electric Vehicles" by Zhaoxuan Zhu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for benchmarking or validation.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly any subsections that discuss the experimental setup or simulations. This is where the authors are likely to describe the datasets used for training and testing their models. I will look for specific names of datasets, their characteristics, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

In this paper, the authors mention the use of a **microscopic traffic simulator** called EcoSim, which is based on the city map of Columbus, OH, US, downloaded from OpenStreetMap. This indicates that the authors used real-world data for their simulations, but I need to confirm if they explicitly mention any datasets.

I will also check the **results and discussion sections** to see if the authors refer to any datasets when discussing their findings or comparing their results with other methods. This could provide additional context or specific datasets that were used.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. For example, if they reference OpenStreetMap, I will ensure to include the proper citation for that source.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format, ready for further processing or review.
