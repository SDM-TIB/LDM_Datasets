To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Live-cell imaging powered by computation" by Hari Shroff et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract and introduction** sections for any mentions of datasets. The abstract discusses computational methods for live-cell fluorescence microscopy but does not specify any datasets. The introduction elaborates on the importance of fluorescence microscopy but again does not mention specific datasets.

Next, I will look through the **methods and results sections** to see if any datasets are referenced in the context of the computational methods discussed. I will pay particular attention to any tables or figures that might summarize datasets used in the experiments.

Upon reviewing the **methods section**, I find that the authors mention various computational techniques and algorithms but do not explicitly name any datasets. I will also check the **discussion section** for any references to datasets used in the context of the computational methods described.

Finally, I will consult the **references section** to see if any datasets are cited indirectly through the references. This is crucial as datasets may be referenced in the context of previous studies or methodologies.

After thoroughly reviewing the paper, I find that there are no specific datasets mentioned by name. However, I will note any relevant references that could lead to datasets used in similar studies.

Since no datasets were explicitly mentioned in the paper, I will not be able to provide full citations for datasets. However, I will document the references that may be useful for further exploration of datasets related to live-cell imaging and computational microscopy.

In conclusion, I will summarize my findings, noting the absence of specific datasets in the paper while highlighting the references that could be explored for potential datasets in future research.
