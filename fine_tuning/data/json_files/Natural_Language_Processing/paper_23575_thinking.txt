To extract datasets from the research paper titled "American Sign Language Handshapes Reflect Pressures for Communicative Efficiency" by Kayo Yin, Terry Regier, and Dan Klein, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on ASL handshapes and communicative efficiency, but I need to look for specific datasets.

Next, I will examine **section 3 (Data)**, which is likely to contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the study. In this section, the authors mention two primary datasets:

1. **ASL-LEX**: This is a public database containing 2,723 ASL signs annotated with their lexical and phonological properties. It includes information on handshape categories and sign frequency ratings by deaf ASL signers.

2. **ASL Fingerspelling Recognition Corpus**: This dataset consists of hand, body, and face landmarks extracted from 116,170 videos of English phrases, addresses, and phone numbers fingerspelled in ASL by over 100 Deaf ASL signers. The authors describe how they processed this dataset to extract static frames of fingerspelled letters.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper:

- For **ASL-LEX**, the citation is:
  > Caselli, N. K., Sevcikova Sehyr, Z., Cohen-Goldberg, A. M., & Emmorey, K. (2017). ASL-LEX: A lexical database of American Sign Language. *Behavior Research Methods*, 49, 784â€“801.

- For **ASL Fingerspelling Recognition Corpus**, the citation is:
  > Chow, A., Cameron, G., Georg, M., Sherwood, M., Culliton, P., Sepah, S., Dane, S., & Starner, T. (2023). Google - American Sign Language Fingerspelling Recognition.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will summarize the information for each dataset, ensuring to include the full citation for each.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that is ready for review or further processing.
