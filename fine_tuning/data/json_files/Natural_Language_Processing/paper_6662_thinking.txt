To extract datasets from the research paper titled "To Know by the Company Words Keep and What Else Lies in the Vicinity" by Jake Ryland Williams and Hunter Scott Heidenreich, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention using several publicly available datasets for their experiments. This indicates that there are datasets relevant to their research, and I will need to find their specific names and details.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly section 5, where the authors describe their methodology for bias measurement via analogies. Here, they mention two corpora: 

1. **Google Books N-grams**: This dataset is referenced as "Google Books’ most recent N-grams release" and is used for token-frequency distributions. 

2. **Wikipedia Articles**: The authors describe a controlled collection of Wikipedia articles that they compiled, specifically linked to UK cities and counties.

In addition, they refer to the **Bigger Analogy Test Set (BATS)**, which is utilized for its size and diversity in analogical comparisons.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to retrieve full citations for these datasets:

- For **Google Books N-grams**, the citation is:
  > Google. 2006. All our n-gram are belong to you. https://ai.googleblog.com/2006/08/all-our-n-gram-are-belong-to-you.html. Accessed: May 27th, 2021.

- For **Bigger Analogy Test Set (BATS)**, the citation is:
  > Anna Gladkova, Aleksandr Drozd, and Satoshi Matsouka. 2016. Analogy-based detection of morphological and semantic relations with word embeddings: what works and what doesn’t. In Proceedings of the NAACL Student Research Workshop, pages 8–15, San Diego, California. Association for Computational Linguistics.

- For the **Wikipedia Articles**, while there is no specific citation provided in the references, the authors mention that they accessed the pages leading to and from any UK city’s Wikipedia page, which can be referenced as:
  > Wikipedia contributors. List of cities in the United Kingdom. Wikipedia, The Free Encyclopedia. Accessed: October 31, 2021. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cities_in_the_United_Kingdom.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented for future reference or analysis.
