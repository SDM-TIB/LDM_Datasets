To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Integrating Semantic Information into Sketchy Reading Module of Retro-Reader for Vietnamese Machine Reading Comprehension" by Hang Thi-Thu Le et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study but may not detail specific datasets. The introduction often outlines the context and significance of the research, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this paper, the authors mention two datasets:

1. **UIT-ViQuAD**: This dataset is specifically created for Vietnamese machine reading comprehension, derived from Vietnamese Wikipedia articles. The paper states that UIT-ViQuAD1.0 initially consisted of only answerable questions, while UIT-ViQuAD2.0 expanded this to include unanswerable questions as well.

2. **LORELEI Vietnamese Language Pack**: This dataset is used for the Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) task and includes various sources such as discussion forums and social networks.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations I will extract are:

- For **UIT-ViQuAD**:
  > K. Nguyen, V. Nguyen, A. Nguyen, and N. Nguyen. *A Vietnamese dataset for evaluating machine reading comprehension*. In Proceedings of the 28th International Conference on Computational Linguistics, 2020, pp. 2595â€“2605.

- For **LORELEI Vietnamese Language Pack**:
  > J. Tracey, S. Strassel, D. Graff, J. Wright, S. Chen, N. Ryant, S. Kulick, K. Griffith, D. Delgado, and M. Arrigo. *LORELEI Vietnamese Representative Language Pack*, 2022. Available: https://hdl.handle.net/11272.1/AB2/JWPEIA.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets, including their purposes and any relevant statistics mentioned in the paper, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as part of the summary. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.
