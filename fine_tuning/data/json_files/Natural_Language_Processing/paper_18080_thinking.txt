To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Attention-Based Recurrent Neural Network For Automatic Behavior Laying Hen Recognition" by Fréjus A. A. Laleye and Mikaël A. Mousse, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and data collection sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors collected and annotated laying hen call signals, which suggests that there is a dataset involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Data collection)**, where the authors describe their dataset in detail. They mention that they built an annotated dataset of different laying hen calls recorded from 10 different farms in Benin. This section provides crucial information about the dataset, including the number of vocalizations and the types of calls recorded.

The authors specify that they recorded a total of 205 laying hens across 8 vocalization types, including Alarm, Food calls, Gakel, Egg laying, Fear, Distress, Panic, and Lonely calls. They also mention the total duration of recordings, which is 135 hours, and the number of signals obtained for each vocalization type.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. However, the paper indicates that the location of the dataset will be public after review, and it does not provide a formal citation for the dataset itself. Instead, it mentions that requests for material should be addressed to the corresponding authors.

Since the dataset is not formally cited in the references, I will summarize the dataset information as follows:

1. **Annotated Dataset of Laying Hen Calls**: This dataset includes recordings of vocalizations from 205 laying hens across 8 different types of calls, collected from 10 farms in Benin. The dataset is intended for research in animal behavior recognition.

Since there is no formal citation available for the dataset, I will note that the dataset's details can be requested from the corresponding authors.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format for clarity, ensuring that I highlight the lack of a formal citation while providing the relevant details about the dataset.
