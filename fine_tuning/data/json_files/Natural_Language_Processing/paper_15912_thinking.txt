To extract datasets from the research paper titled "VT-Former: An Exploratory Study on Vehicle Trajectory Prediction for Highway Surveillance through Graph Isomorphism and Transformer" by Armin Danesh Pazho et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study evaluates the VT-Former model across three benchmark datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention three datasets:

1. **NGSIM Dataset**: This dataset consists of two subsets, US-101 and I-80, which provide real-world traffic scenarios captured from surveillance cameras. The authors describe it as containing millions of data samples in a bird’s-eye view format.

2. **Carolina’s Highway Dataset (CHD)**: This dataset includes vehicle trajectory data from various locations in North and South Carolina, recorded at different angles (eye-level and high-angle). The authors note that it contains annotations for multi-vehicle detection and tracking.

In this section, the authors provide enough detail about each dataset, including their characteristics and the context in which they were collected.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to guide readers to the original sources.

The citations I will extract are:

- For the **NGSIM Dataset**:
  > James Colyar and John Halkias. *Next Generation Simulation (NGSIM), US Highway-101 dataset*. FHWA-HRT-07-030, 2007.

- For the **Carolina’s Highway Dataset (CHD)**:
  > Vinit Katariya, Ghazal Alinezhad Noghre, Armin Danesh Pazho, Christopher Neff, and Hamed Tabkhi. *Carolina’s Highway Dataset*. UNCC/Carolinas_Dataset, 2023. Dataset.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the study along with their proper citations.
