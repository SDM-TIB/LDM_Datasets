To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SoftDedup: an Efficient Data Reweighting Method for Speeding Up Language Model Pre-training" by Nan He et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the effectiveness of the proposed soft deduplication method and hints at the use of various datasets for empirical analysis. However, it does not specify any dataset names.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experimental Setup)**, particularly **subsection 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention:

1. **RedPajama CommonCrawl**: A subset of the RedPajama dataset that has undergone paragraph-level deduplication but not rigorous deduplication.
2. **SlimPajama CommonCrawl**: A refined version of the RedPajama dataset with enhanced data cleansing and MinHashLSH for deduplication.
3. **Falcon RefinedWeb**: A pre-training dataset for the Falcon series that has undergone rigorous deduplication processes.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **RedPajama CommonCrawl**:
  > Together Computer. 2023. *Redpajama: an open dataset for training large language models*.

- For **SlimPajama CommonCrawl**:
  > Daria Soboleva et al. 2023. *SlimPajama: A 627B token cleaned and deduplicated version of RedPajama*.

- For **Falcon RefinedWeb**:
  > Guilherme Penedo et al. 2023. *The refinedweb dataset for falcon llm: outperforming curated corpora with web data, and web data only*.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
