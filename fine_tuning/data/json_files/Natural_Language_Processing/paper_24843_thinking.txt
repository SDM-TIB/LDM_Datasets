To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Comparing fine-grained and coarse-grained object detection for ecology" by Jess Tam and Justin Kay, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on camera trap images, which suggests that datasets related to wildlife monitoring may be present.

Next, I will examine **section 3 (Methods)**, where the authors describe the dataset they constructed for their study. Here, they mention the **Wild Deserts dataset**, which is a key dataset used in their experiments. The description includes details about the dataset's purpose, the number of images, and the classes of wildlife included.

In **section 3.1**, the authors provide specific information about the **Wild Deserts dataset**: it consists of 15,000 images collected from 30 different cameras, covering 15 classes of wildlife. They also discuss the process of data labeling and the adjustments made to the dataset to balance class distributions.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. However, since the dataset is part of the authors' own research, it may not have a separate citation. Instead, I will note that the dataset is derived from the Wild Deserts project, which is mentioned in the paper.

Now, I will summarize the dataset information:

1. **Wild Deserts Dataset**: This dataset is used to investigate the effects of fine-grained versus coarse-grained classification in wildlife detection. It contains 15,000 images of wildlife collected from camera traps in Sturt National Park, New South Wales, Australia, and includes 15 classes of wildlife.

Since the dataset is part of the authors' research and does not have a separate citation, I will note that it is associated with the Wild Deserts project.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format for further processing, ensuring that I include the relevant details and context for the dataset as described in the paper.
