To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Understanding User Behavior in Carousel Recommendation Systems for Click Modeling and Learning to Rank" by Santiago de Leon-Martinez, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned or implied. The abstract indicates that the author plans to conduct an eye-tracking user study and make the dataset publicly available, which suggests that a new dataset will be created.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the author discusses the lack of public datasets in carousel recommendation systems. The author mentions two existing datasets: one from Deezer and another from a small user study of clicks in ranked lists and carousels. I will note these datasets for further citation.

In the **methodology section**, the author outlines the design of the eye-tracking user study, which aims to generate a new dataset based on user interactions with carousel interfaces. This dataset will consist of click data from at least 60 participants browsing through movie carousels, resulting in approximately 1800 clicks of feedback. I will highlight this dataset as it is a significant contribution of the research.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. For the **Deezer dataset**, the citation is:
   > Walid Bendada, Guillaume Salha, and Théo Bontempelli. *Carousel Personalization in Music Streaming Apps with Contextual Bandits*. In Fourteenth ACM Conference on Recommender Systems. ACM, Virtual Event Brazil, 420–425, 2020. https://doi.org/10.1145/3383313.3412217

2. For the **small user study dataset**, the citation is:
   > Dietmar Jannach, Mathias Jesse, Michael Jugovac, and Christoph Trattner. *Exploring Multi-List User Interfaces for Similar-Item Recommendations*. In Proceedings of the 29th ACM Conference on User Modeling, Adaptation and Personalization. ACM, Utrecht Netherlands, 224–228, 2021. https://doi.org/10.1145/3450613.3456809

3. The new dataset generated from the eye-tracking study will not have a citation yet, as it is proposed to be made publicly available after the study is conducted.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for the existing datasets and a note about the new dataset that will be created. This structured approach will ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.
