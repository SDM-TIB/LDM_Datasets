To extract datasets from the research paper titled "PsySafe: A Comprehensive Framework for Psychological-based Attack, Defense, and Evaluation of Multi-agent System Safety" by Zaibin Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that the authors will make their data and code publicly accessible, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **Methodology section**, particularly the subsection titled **3.1 Dataset**. Here, the authors describe their dataset, which includes both safe and dangerous tasks. They specify that the safe data consists of 200 tasks, while the dangerous data aggregates 659 distinct dangerous questions from two sources: **DoAnythingNow** and **AdvBench**. This section provides a clear indication of the datasets used in their experiments.

In the **Experiments section**, the authors mention that they conducted experiments on both a base dataset and a tiny dataset. The base dataset contains 859 tasks, while the tiny dataset consists of 125 tasks. This reinforces the importance of the datasets mentioned earlier.

Now, I will check the **References section** to gather full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. For the **DoAnythingNow dataset**, the citation is:
   > Shen, X., Chen, Z., Backes, M., Shen, Y., & Zhang, Y. (2023). "Do Anything Now": Characterizing and evaluating in-the-wild jailbreak prompts on large language models. arXiv preprint arXiv:2308.03825.

2. For the **AdvBench dataset**, the citation is:
   > Zou, A., Wang, Z., Kolter, J. Z., & Fredrikson, M. (2023). Universal and transferable adversarial attacks on aligned language models. arXiv preprint arXiv:2307.15043.

Next, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required.

After completing this process, I will have a structured output ready for review or further processing, summarizing the datasets extracted from the paper.
