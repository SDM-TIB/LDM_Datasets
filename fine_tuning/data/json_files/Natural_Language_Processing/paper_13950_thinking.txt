To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Decompose Semantic Shifts for Composed Image Retrieval" by Xingyu Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors validate their method on two widely-used composed image retrieval benchmarks, which indicates that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets and Metrics)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention:

1. **CIRR Dataset**: This dataset is described as the first released dataset for the composed image retrieval task, consisting of 36,554 triplets of real-life images and human-generated modification sentences. The dataset is derived from the NLVR2 dataset, which contains real-world entities. The authors specify that 80% of the data is used for training, 10% for validation, and 10% for evaluation.

2. **FashionIQ Dataset**: This dataset is characterized as a realistic dataset for interactive image retrieval in the fashion domain, containing queries composed of one reference image and two natural language descriptions about the visual differences of the target image. The authors refer to the original evaluation split, which includes 5,373, 3,817, and 6,346 images across three specific fashion categories.

To confirm the details of these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations:

- For the **CIRR Dataset**, the citation is:

- For the **FashionIQ Dataset**, the citation is:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations.
