To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Robust Out-of-Distribution Generalization Bounds via Sharpness" by Yingtian Zou et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to find any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and it may mention specific datasets used for experiments or evaluations.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as this is typically where authors describe the datasets they used for their evaluations. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and any relevant details about their structure or purpose.

In this paper, I will pay particular attention to any figures or tables that may summarize the datasets used, as they often provide concise information about the datasets and their characteristics.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and for readers who may want to access the datasets themselves.

From my reading, I will extract the following datasets:

1. **Wilds-Camelyon17 Dataset**: This dataset includes 455,954 tumor and normal tissue slide images from five hospitals, used to evaluate the robustness of the proposed methods against distribution shifts.

From detection of individual metastases to classification of lymph node status at the patient level: the Camelyon17 challenge. *IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging*.

2. **PACS Dataset**: This dataset contains 9,991 images of 7 objects in 4 visual styles (art painting, cartoon, photo, and sketch), used for evaluating domain generalization.

   Citation:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that all relevant datasets are accurately documented and attributed.
