To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Referring to Screen Texts with Voice Assistants" by Shruti Bhargava et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the research focus and any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors collected a dataset called **ScreenRef**, which is a key dataset for their work.

Next, I will look into **section 4 (Task and Dataset)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset they collected. They describe **ScreenRef** as a collection of requests to voice assistants with references to actionable text categories on screens, including phone numbers, addresses, email addresses, URLs, and date/time. The dataset consists of 14,000 requests and is divided into two collections: **Descriptive Data** and **Category-level Data**.

In the **Descriptive Data** section, the authors explain that this part of the dataset is based on screens with multiple similar entities, allowing for descriptive references. The **Category-level Data** includes simpler references to a category without disambiguating within that category.

I will also check the **References section** to find any citations related to the dataset. However, the authors mention that due to privacy concerns, they are unable to share the dataset publicly. They do not provide a formal citation for **ScreenRef**, but they do reference other works related to visual grounding datasets, such as those by Kazemzadeh et al. (2014) and Mao et al. (2016), which may be relevant for understanding the context of their dataset.

Since the paper does not provide a formal citation for **ScreenRef**, I will note that it is an internal dataset created by the authors and does not have a publicly available citation. However, I will still document the dataset's details as follows:

1. **Dataset Name**: ScreenRef
   - **Description**: A dataset of 14,000 requests to voice assistants with references to actionable text categories on screens, including phone numbers, addresses, email addresses, URLs, and date/time. It consists of two collections: Descriptive Data and Category-level Data.
   - **Citation**: Not publicly available due to privacy concerns.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset details into a structured format for clarity and future reference. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the dataset's significance and context as presented in the paper.
