To extract datasets from the research paper titled "LLM Circuit Analyses Are Consistent Across Training and Scale" by Curt Tigges et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the text.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract provides a high-level overview of the study, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the research, which may include references to datasets used for experiments. 

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **methods** section, particularly in subsections that discuss experimental design or data collection. This section typically contains detailed descriptions of the datasets used, including their characteristics and purposes.

In this paper, I notice that the authors mention several tasks and datasets in the **Methods** section, specifically in subsection 2.4 (Tasks). The tasks include:

1. **Indirect Object Identification (IOI)**: The authors state that they used a small dataset of 70 IOI examples created with Wang et al.'s (2023) generator. This indicates a specific dataset used for this task.

2. **Gendered-Pronoun**: The authors refer to a dataset crafted with 70 examples as in Mathwin et al. (2023). This dataset is used to measure the gender of pronouns in context.

3. **Greater-Than**: The authors mention creating 200 examples with Hanna et al.'s (2023) generator for this task.

4. **Subject-Verb Agreement (SVA)**: The authors state that they used 200 synthetic SVA example sentences from Newman et al. (2021).

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets.

The citations I will extract are:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant datasets from the paper while providing proper attribution.
