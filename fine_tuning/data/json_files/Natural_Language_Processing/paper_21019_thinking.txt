To extract datasets from the research paper titled "360+x: A Panoptic Multi-modal Scene Understanding Dataset" by Hao Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract highlights the creation of a unique dataset that encompasses multiple viewpoints and modalities, which suggests that there will be detailed descriptions of the datasets in the subsequent sections.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (360+x Dataset)**, where the authors provide a comprehensive overview of the dataset. Here, they describe the dataset's structure, including the various views (360° panoramic, third-person front view, egocentric monocular, and binocular views) and the modalities (video, audio, directional binaural delay, etc.). This section is crucial as it outlines the specifics of the dataset.

In **subsection 3.3 (Data Annotation)**, the authors detail the scene categories and the temporal segmentation labels. They mention that the dataset comprises 28 scene categories, which is essential information for understanding the dataset's scope.

I will also check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets referenced in the paper. The authors mention existing datasets like UCF101, ActivityNet, and Kinetics, which are relevant for comparative analysis.

The full citations I will extract include:

1. **360+x Dataset**: 
   - Hao Chen, Yuqi Hou, Chenyuan Qu, Irene Testini, Xiaohan Hong, Jianbo Jiao. *360+x: A Panoptic Multi-modal Scene Understanding Dataset*. Project page: https://x360dataset.github.io/

2. **UCF101 Dataset**:
   - Khurram Soomro, Amir Roshan Zamir, and Mubarak Shah. *UCF101: A dataset of 101 human actions classes from videos in the wild*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1212.0402, 2012.

3. **ActivityNet Dataset**:
   - Bernard Ghanem, Fabian Caba Heilbron, Victor Escorcia, and Juan Carlos Niebles. *ActivityNet: A large-scale video benchmark for human activity understanding*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 961–970, 2015.

4. **Kinetics Dataset**:
   - Will Kay, Joao Carreira, Karen Simonyan, Brian Zhang, Chloe Hillier, Sudheendra Vijayanarasimhan, Fabio Viola, Tim Green, Trevor Back, Paul Natsev, et al. *The kinetics human action video dataset*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1705.06950, 2017.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets referenced in the paper, ready for further processing or review.
