To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Distributed UAV Swarm Augmented Wideband Spectrum Sensing Using Nyquist Folding Receiver" by Kaili Jiang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus, which may include mentions of datasets used for experiments or simulations.

Next, I will examine the **experiments and results sections** to look for specific datasets that were utilized in the research. This is where the authors typically describe the datasets in detail, including their characteristics, sizes, and any relevant parameters.

In this paper, the authors discuss two scenarios involving UAV swarms and mention the use of a **simulation environment** for their experiments. I will look for any specific datasets or simulation parameters that are explicitly stated.

After identifying potential datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets.

For example, if the authors refer to a specific dataset used in their simulations, I will ensure to note its name and the corresponding citation. If they mention any publicly available datasets, I will look for the original papers or sources that describe those datasets.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation as per the standards of academic writing.

Finally, I will organize this information clearly, ready for presentation or further processing, ensuring that all datasets are accurately represented with their respective citations.
