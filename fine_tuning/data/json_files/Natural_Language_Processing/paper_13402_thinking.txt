To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SAAN: Similarity-aware attention flow network for change detection with VHR remote sensing images" by Haonan Guo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for evaluation. The introduction typically outlines the context and significance of the research, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically looking for any subsections that detail the datasets used. In this paper, the authors mention conducting experiments on three change detection tasks, which suggests that multiple datasets are involved.

In the **experiments section**, the authors explicitly describe the datasets:

1. **LEVIR-CD Dataset**: This dataset is a large-scale building change detection dataset covering 20 different cities in the US, with images of 0.5m spatial resolution and over 30,000 change buildings. The dataset is processed into pairs for training, validation, and testing.

2. **CDD Dataset**: This dataset contains 16,000 season-varying image pairs with spatial resolutions ranging from 0.03m to 1m, including various change objects like cars, roads, and buildings.

3. **SECOND Dataset**: A semantic change detection benchmark containing 30 types of semantic change information across 6 land-cover categories, with 4662 image pairs of size 512x512.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **LEVIR-CD Dataset**:
  > Chen, H., Wu, C., Du, B., & Zhang, L. (2020). Change Detection in Multi-temporal VHR Images Based on Deep Siamese Multi-scale Convolutional Networks. *arXiv:1906.11479*.

- For the **CDD Dataset**:
  > Zhang, Y., Zhong, Y., Ma, A., & Zhang, L. (2021). Change Detection in Remote Sensing Images: A Review. *Remote Sensing*, 13(10), 1950. doi:10.3390/rs13101950.

- For the **SECOND Dataset**:
  > Yang, K., Zhang, L., Zhong, Y., & Ma, A. (2021). Semantic Change Detection with Asymmetric Siamese Networks. *arXiv:2010.05687*.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described clearly and that the full citations are included. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
