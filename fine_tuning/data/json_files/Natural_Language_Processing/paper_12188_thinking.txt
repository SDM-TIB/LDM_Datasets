To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MargCTGAN: A 'Marginally' Better CTGAN for the Low Sample Regime" by Tejumade Afonja et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of synthetic tabular data generators, which suggests that datasets are involved, but I need to pinpoint their names.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they mention four benchmark tabular datasets:

1. **Adult Dataset**: This dataset is derived from the 1994 U.S. Census and contains 48,000 samples with 14 attributes. The task associated with this dataset is binary classification to determine if an individual earns more than $50,000 a year.

2. **Census Dataset**: This dataset is a weighted version of the U.S. Census data from 1994-5, containing over 299,000 samples and 40 attributes. It also involves a binary classification task to predict income above $50,000.

3. **News Dataset**: This dataset consists of over 39,000 instances with 58 attributes, summarizing features about articles published by Mashable. The goal is to predict the number of shares on social networks, treated as a binary classification task.

4. **Texas Dataset**: This dataset includes 100,000 records from the Texas Department of State Health Services, focusing on predicting minor and major mortality risk. The final dataset size is 75,159 records with 18 attributes.

I will then check the **References section** to gather the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Adult Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Kohavi, R., & Becker, B. (1996). UCI Machine Learning Repository: Adult Data Set. UCI Machine Learning Repository. Accessed: 2022-05-10.

- For the **Census Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Lane, T., & Kohavi, R. (2010). Census-income (KDD) Data Set. UCI Machine Learning Repository. Accessed: 2022-05-10.

- For the **News Dataset**, the citation is:

  > Stadler, T., Oprisanu, B., & Troncoso, C. (2022). Synthetic dataâ€“anonymisation groundhog day. In 31st USENIX Security Symposium (USENIX Security 22).

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This structured approach will help in accurately documenting the datasets used in the research.
