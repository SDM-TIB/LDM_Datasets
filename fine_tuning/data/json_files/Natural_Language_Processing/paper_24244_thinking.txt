To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Encoder vs Decoder: Comparative Analysis of Encoder and Decoder Language Models on Multilingual NLU Tasks" by Dan Saattrup Nielsen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the paper builds upon the **ScandEval benchmark**, which suggests that datasets related to this benchmark may be discussed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Datasets)**, as this section is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets used in the experiments. I will look for specific dataset names, descriptions, and any relevant details such as the number of samples, languages, and tasks associated with each dataset.

In section 3, the authors mention several datasets for different tasks:

1. **DANSK**: A dataset for Danish named entity recognition.
   - Citation: Enevoldsen, K., Trenckner Jessen, E., & Baglini, R. (2024). *Dansk and Dacy 2.6.0: Domain generalization of Danish named entity recognition*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2402.18209.

2. **SUC 3.0**: A dataset for Swedish named entity recognition.
   - Citation: Gustafson-Capková, S., & Hartmann, B. (2006). *Manual of the Stockholm Umeå corpus version 2.0*. Stockholm University.

3. **NorNE**: A dataset for Norwegian named entity recognition.
   - Citation: Jørgensen, F., Aasmoe, T., Husevåg, A.-S. R., Øvrelid, L., & Velldal, E. (2020). *NorNE: Annotating named entities for Norwegian*. In Proceedings of the Twelfth Language Resources and Evaluation Conference (LREC 2020), pages 4547–4556.

4. **MIM-GOLD-NER**: A dataset for Icelandic named entity recognition.
   - Citation: Ingólfsdóttir, S. L., Gudjónsson, Á. A., & Loftsson, H. (2020). *Named Entity Recognition for Icelandic: Annotated Corpus and Models*. In International Conference on Statistical Language and Speech Processing, pages 46–57.

5. **FoNE**: A dataset for Faroese named entity recognition.
   - Citation: Snæbjarnarson, V., & Einarsson, H. (2023). *Transfer to a low-resource language via close relatives: The case study on Faroese*. In Proceedings of the 24th Nordic Conference on Computational Linguistics (NoDaLiDa), pages 728–737.

6. **GermEval**: A dataset for German named entity recognition.
   - Citation: Benikova, D., Biemann, C., & Reznicek, M. (2014). *Nosta-d named entity annotation for German: Guidelines and dataset*. In Proceedings of the Ninth International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC 2014), pages 2524–2531.

7. **CoNLL-2002**: A dataset for Dutch named entity recognition.
   - Citation: Sang, E. T. K. (2002). *Introduction to the CoNLL-2002 shared task: Language-independent named entity recognition*. In COLING-02: The 6th Conference on Natural Language Learning 2002 (CoNLL-2002).

8. **CoNLL-2003**: A dataset for English named entity recognition.
   - Citation: Sang, E. T. K., & De Meulder, F. (2003). *Introduction to the CoNLL-2003 shared task: Language-independent named entity recognition*. In Proceedings of the Seventh Conference on Natural Language Learning at HLT-NAACL 2003, pages 142–147.

I will also check the **experiments section** to confirm that these datasets were indeed used in the evaluation of the models, which will further validate their relevance.

Finally, I will compile the dataset names along with their full citations into a structured format for easy reference. This ensures that I have accurately captured all necessary information regarding the datasets used in the research paper.
