To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Prompting Code Interpreter to Write Better Unit Tests on Quixbugs Functions" by Vincent Li and Nick Doiron, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the use of the **Quixbugs dataset**, which indicates that this dataset is central to the study.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section, where the authors discuss the Quixbugs dataset in the context of their research. They state that the study focuses on how different prompts affect the quality of unit tests generated for functions in the Quixbugs dataset. This confirms that the Quixbugs dataset is indeed a key dataset used in their experiments.

In the **methodology section**, the authors provide more details about the Quixbugs dataset, explaining that it contains both correct and incorrect implementations of focal functions, which are used for generating unit tests. This section reinforces the importance of the dataset in their research.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the Quixbugs dataset. The citation provided in the references is:

- **Quixbugs Dataset**: 
  > Derrick Lin, James Koppel, Angela Chen, and Armando Solar-Lezama. "QuixBugs: a multi-lingual program repair benchmark set based on the quixey challenge." In ACM SIGPLAN International Conference on Systems, Humanity: Applications: (2017). MAG ID: 7f1d443ab526240e2647e77e042434fc98249302, pages 55â€“56. doi: 10.1145/3135932.3135941.

Since the paper primarily discusses the Quixbugs dataset, I will focus on this dataset for extraction.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the dataset as it is crucial for proper attribution.

In summary, the steps I took include:
1. Reading the abstract and introduction to identify the dataset.
2. Analyzing the methodology section for details about the dataset's use.
3. Retrieving the full citation from the references section.

With this information, I am ready to create the dataset entry for the Quixbugs dataset.
