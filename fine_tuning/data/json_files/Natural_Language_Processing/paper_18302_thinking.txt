To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Can I trust my fake data - A comprehensive quality assessment framework for synthetic tabular data in healthcare" by Vibeke Binz Vallevik et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract discusses the use of synthetic data (SD) in healthcare, which suggests that datasets may be involved, particularly in the context of quality evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **Material and Methods section**, specifically looking for any subsections that detail the datasets used in their research. In this section, the authors mention benchmarking their framework against a practical case from the **Dutch National Cancer Registry (DNCR)**. This indicates that the DNCR dataset is likely a key dataset in their study.

I will also check the **Results section** for any additional datasets that may have been used for comparison or validation purposes. The authors discuss various quality metrics and evaluation frameworks, but I need to ensure that they explicitly mention any datasets used in their evaluations.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. For the **Dutch National Cancer Registry**, I will look for the original source or any relevant publications that describe the dataset in detail.

Based on my findings, I will compile the datasets and their citations. For example, if the Dutch National Cancer Registry is the only dataset mentioned, I will ensure to include its full citation, which may look something like this:

- **Dutch National Cancer Registry**: 
  > Netherlands Comprehensive Cancer Organisation (IKNL). *Dutch National Cancer Registry*. Available at: https://iknl.nl/en/ncr/synthetic-dataset.

If there are additional datasets mentioned, I will follow the same process for each, ensuring that I capture the full citation for each dataset accurately.

Finally, I will summarize the extracted datasets and their citations in a clear format for easy reference, ensuring that all information is organized and ready for further analysis or reporting.
