To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MoME: Mixture of Multimodal Experts for Cancer Survival Prediction" by Conghao Xiong et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method on various datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will look into **section 3 (Experiments and Results)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they refer to three datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project:

1. **TCGA-BLCA**: This dataset consists of 373 samples of Bladder Urothelial Carcinoma (BLCA).
2. **TCGA-UCEC**: This dataset includes 480 samples of Uterine Corpus Endometrial Carcinoma (UCEC).
3. **TCGA-LUAD**: This dataset contains 453 samples of Lung Adenocarcinoma (LUAD).

The authors provide a brief description of each dataset, indicating the number of samples and the type of cancer represented.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. The TCGA datasets are typically cited from the original TCGA project publications. The relevant citations for these datasets are:

- For **TCGA-BLCA**:
  > The Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network. *Comprehensive Molecular Characterization of Urothelial Bladder Carcinoma*. Cell 171(3), 540-556.e25, 2017.

- For **TCGA-UCEC**:
  > The Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network. *Integrated Genomic and Molecular Characterization of Endometrial Carcinoma*. Nature 497(7447), 67-73, 2013.

- For **TCGA-LUAD**:
  > The Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network. *Comprehensive Molecular Profiling of Lung Adenocarcinoma*. Nature 511(7511), 543-550, 2014.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations.
