To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Latent Field Discovery In Interacting Dynamical Systems With Neural Fields" by Miltiadis Kofinas et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the datasets that might be referenced. The abstract mentions experiments on various field settings, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will look for specific sections that typically contain dataset information, such as **section 5 (Experiments)** and any dedicated **dataset sections**. In section 5, the authors describe their experiments on different field settings, including static and dynamic fields. They mention datasets related to charged particles, traffic scenes, and gravitational n-body problems.

I will then extract the relevant datasets mentioned in the experiments:

1. **Electrostatic Field Dataset**: This dataset is based on the work of Kipf et al. (2018) and involves simulations of interacting charged particles. The authors generated 50,000 simulations for training, 10,000 for validation, and 10,000 for testing.

2. **Traffic Scenes Dataset (inD)**: This dataset consists of real-world traffic scenes with trajectories of pedestrians, vehicles, and cyclists. The authors created a subset from the inD dataset, focusing on a single location in Aachen, Germany, using 8 recordings for training, 2 for validation, and 2 for testing.

3. **Gravitational n-body Dataset**: This dataset extends the work of Brandstetter et al. (2022) and involves simulations of gravitational interactions among particles. The authors created 50,000 simulations for training, 10,000 for validation, and 10,000 for testing.

After identifying these datasets, I will ensure that I have the full citations for each dataset, as they are crucial for proper referencing. I will compile this information into a structured format for easy access and review.

Finally, I will summarize the findings, ensuring that each dataset is clearly documented with its respective citation, ready for any further processing or analysis.
