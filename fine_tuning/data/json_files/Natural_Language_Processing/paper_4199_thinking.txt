To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Source-Criticism Debiasing Method for GloVe Embeddings" by Hope McGovern, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses a method for debiasing GloVe embeddings but does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will proceed to the introduction.

In the **introduction**, the author references the use of GloVe embeddings and mentions the influence of training data on bias, but again, no specific datasets are named. I will continue to the **methodology section**.

In **section 3 (Methodology)**, the author describes the dataset used for their experiments. The paper states that the dataset consists of a corpus constructed from a Simple English Wikipedia dump. This is a significant finding, as it indicates the source of the data used in the experiments.

Next, I will look for any additional datasets mentioned in the **results section** or elsewhere in the paper. The results section primarily discusses the performance of the proposed method and does not introduce new datasets.

Now, I will gather the full citation for the dataset mentioned. The Simple English Wikipedia dump is a publicly available dataset, and I can reference it as follows:

- For the **Simple English Wikipedia dump**, the citation is:
  > Wikimedia Foundation. *Simple English Wikipedia*. Available at: https://dumps.wikimedia.org/simplewiki/

Since this is the only dataset explicitly mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information into a structured format for clarity.

Finally, I will ensure that I have accurately captured the dataset's name, description, and citation before preparing the final output.
