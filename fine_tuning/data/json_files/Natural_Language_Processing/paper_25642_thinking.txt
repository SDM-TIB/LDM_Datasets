To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The Development of a Comprehensive Spanish Dictionary for Phonetic and Lexical Tagging in Socio-phonetic Research (ESPADA)" by Simon Gonzalez, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract highlights the creation of a comprehensive pronunciation dictionary in Spanish (ESPADA), which suggests that this is a primary dataset of interest.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, specifically section 5, where the author describes how the Spanish lexicon was extracted from two freely available sources. This is crucial as it provides the basis for the dataset.

The two sources mentioned are:

1. **Diccionario de la Real Academia de la Lengua Española**: This is a well-known dictionary that provides a comprehensive lexicon of the Spanish language. The text file was compiled by Domínguez (2015), which indicates that this dataset is a significant component of the ESPADA project.

2. **LibreOffice database**: This database contains word entries organized alphabetically and includes a folder for each of the 16 Spanish-speaking countries. This resource allows for the customization of pronunciation dictionaries based on specific dialectal features.

Now, I will check the **References section** to gather full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Diccionario de la Real Academia de la Lengua Española**, the citation is:
  > REAL ACADEMIA ESPAÑOLA. *Diccionario de la lengua española*, 23.ª ed., [versión 23.5 en línea]. https://dle.rae.es

- For the **LibreOffice database**, the citation is:
  > Foundation, T. D. (2020). *LibreOffice Writer*. Retrieved from https://www.libreoffice.org/discover/writer/

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets:

1. **ESPADA Dictionary**: A comprehensive pronunciation dictionary for Spanish, containing over 628,000 entries, representing words from 16 countries, with phonetic and lexical tagging.

2. **Diccionario de la Real Academia de la Lengua Española**: A foundational dataset for the Spanish lexicon, compiled by Domínguez (2015).

3. **LibreOffice Database**: A dataset containing word entries organized by country, allowing for dialect-specific pronunciation dictionaries.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its full citation.
