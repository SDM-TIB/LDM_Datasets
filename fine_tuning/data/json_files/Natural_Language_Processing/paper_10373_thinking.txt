To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Student Classroom Behavior Detection based on YOLOv7-BRA and Multi-Model Fusion" by Fan Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the construction of a dataset called the **Student Classroom Behavior dataset (SCB-Dataset)**, which contains 11,248 labels and 4,001 images. This indicates that this dataset is central to the research and needs to be documented.

Next, I will look into **section 3 (SCB-dataset)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset. They describe the dataset's focus on hand-raising behavior in classroom settings and highlight its unique characteristics, such as the challenges posed by dense environments and varying angles of capture. This section confirms that the SCB-Dataset is the primary dataset used in their experiments.

In the **experiments section**, the authors mention that they conducted experiments using the SCB-Dataset, which further validates its importance in the research.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the SCB-Dataset. However, since the SCB-Dataset is newly constructed and publicly available, it may not have a formal citation in the references. Instead, the authors provide a link to download the dataset from GitHub: https://github.com/Whiffe/SCB-dataset. This link will serve as the citation for the dataset.

To summarize, the dataset extracted from the paper is:

1. **SCB-Dataset**: A dataset specifically constructed for detecting student classroom behaviors, focusing on hand-raising actions. It contains 4,001 images and 11,248 labels.

The citation for the SCB-Dataset is:
> Fan Yang, Tao Wang, and Xiaofei Wang. *Student Classroom Behavior Detection based on YOLOv7-BRA and Multi-Model Fusion*. Available at: https://github.com/Whiffe/SCB-dataset.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry in the required format for further processing or review.
