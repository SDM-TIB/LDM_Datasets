To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Ethical Framework for Harnessing the Power of AI in Healthcare and Beyond" by Sidra Nasir, Rizwan Ahmed Khan, and Samita Bai, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections that discuss methodologies or experiments** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a general overview, but specific datasets are often detailed in the methodology or results sections.

Next, I will focus on the **sections that discuss data management, AI applications in healthcare, and any empirical studies**. These sections may contain references to datasets used for analysis or case studies. I will look for any tables, figures, or references that explicitly mention datasets.

In the text, I notice a section titled **"DATASET"** that lists several datasets: **PPB, IJB-A, and Adience**. I will extract the relevant details about these datasets, including their descriptions and any statistics provided.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for the datasets used in the research.

1. **PPB Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Buolamwini, J., & Gebru, T. (2018). *Gender shades: Intersectional accuracy disparities in commercial gender classification*. In Conference on fairness, accountability and transparency (pp. 77–91). PMLR.

2. **IJB-A Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Klare, B. F., Klein, A., Taborsky, E., Blanton, A., Cheney, J., Allen, K., Grother, P., Mah, A., & Jain, A. K. (2015). *Pushing the frontiers of unconstrained face detection and recognition: Iarpa janus benchmark a*. In Proceedings of the IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition (pp. 1931–1939).

3. **Adience Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Levi, G., & Hassner, T. (2015). *Age and gender classification using convolutional neural networks*. In Proceedings of the IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition workshops (pp. 34–42).

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets referenced in the paper, ready for further processing or review.
