To extract datasets from the research paper titled "US & MRI Image Fusion Based on Markerless Skin Registration" by Martina Paccini et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or data sources used in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental results section** (Section 4) where the authors typically discuss the datasets used for validation and testing. I will look for specific names of datasets, descriptions of their contents, and any relevant details about how they were utilized in the study.

In this paper, the authors describe their method for fusing MRI and ultrasound images, but they do not explicitly mention any publicly available datasets. Instead, they refer to experimental tests conducted on a phantom model and real subjects. I will note that while they do not provide specific dataset names, they do mention using a phantom (CIRS Model 057) for testing.

Since the paper does not provide full citations for any datasets, I will need to look for the phantom model's citation in the references section. The phantom is a specific model used in medical imaging, and I will ensure to include its citation.

Now, I will compile the information I have gathered:

1. **CIRS Model 057 Phantom**: This phantom was used for testing the accuracy of the image fusion system. It is a well-known model in medical imaging research.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the CIRS Model 057 phantom. If the citation is not explicitly listed, I will search for it in external databases or resources to ensure I provide an accurate reference.

After gathering all necessary information, I will summarize the datasets and their citations in a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for review or further processing, ensuring that all citations are complete and accurate.
