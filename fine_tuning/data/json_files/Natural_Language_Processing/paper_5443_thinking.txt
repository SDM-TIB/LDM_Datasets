To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Overcoming Limited Battery Data Challenges: A Coupled Neural Network Approach" by Aniruddh Herle et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any datasets mentioned. The authors discuss the use of "few public battery datasets" for evaluation, indicating that datasets are indeed involved.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section, where the authors highlight the challenges of limited data availability in battery research. They mention the need for diverse datasets, which suggests that they will reference specific datasets later in the paper.

I will then focus on **section 4 (Dataset)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used in their work. Here, they mention:

1. **Oxford Battery Degradation Dataset**: This dataset consists of charging-discharging cycles of eight Kokam Co. Ltd., SLPB533459H4 cells. The authors specify that they used the proﬁles of the first three cells, capturing voltage, temperature, and charge values.

2. **Center for Advanced Life Cycle Engineering Dataset**: This dataset is used to test the models for dynamic situations, specifically mentioning the BJDST and US06 drive cycles.

In the **References section**, I will look for the full citations of these datasets:

- For the **Oxford Battery Degradation Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Birkl, C. (2017). *Oxford Battery Degradation Dataset 1*. University of Oxford.

- For the **Center for Advanced Life Cycle Engineering Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Zheng, F., Xing, Y., Jiang, J., Sun, B., Kim, J., & Pecht, M. (2016). Inﬂuence of diﬀerent open circuit voltage tests on state of charge online estimation for lithium-ion batteries. *Applied Energy*, 183, 513-525. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.09.010

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
