To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Face-StyleSpeech: Improved Face-to-Voice Latent Mapping for Natural Zero-Shot Speech Synthesis from a Face Image" by Minki Kang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract introduces the concept of generating speech from face images and hints at the use of datasets for training and validation.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors discuss the challenges of synthesizing speech from face images and reference previous works. This section may provide insights into the datasets used in their experiments.

In the **experiments section**, I will look for specific mentions of datasets. The authors state that they used the **LibriTTS-R dataset** for training the TTS model and the **VoxCeleb dataset** for training the face encoder. They also mention using **VoxCeleb 2** for evaluation, which is crucial for understanding the datasets involved in their research.

Now, I will gather detailed information about each dataset from the **References section** to ensure I have the full citations:

1. **LibriTTS-R Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Yuma Koizumi, Heiga Zen, Shigeki Karita, Yifan Ding, Kohei Yatabe, Nobuyuki Morioka, Michiel Bacchiani, Yu Zhang, Wei Han, and Ankur Bapna. *LibriTTS-R: A Restored Multi-Speaker Text-to-Speech Corpus*. arXiv, vol. abs/2305.18802, 2023.

2. **VoxCeleb Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Arsha Nagrani, Joon Son Chung, and Andrew Zisserman. *VoxCeleb: A Large-Scale Speaker Identification Dataset*. Interspeech, 2017.

3. **VoxCeleb 2 Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Joon Son Chung, Arsha Nagrani, and Andrew Zisserman. *VoxCeleb2: Deep Speaker Recognition*. Interspeech, 2018.

After collecting this information, I will summarize the datasets, ensuring to include their full citations as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, which is essential for any further analysis or replication of the study.
