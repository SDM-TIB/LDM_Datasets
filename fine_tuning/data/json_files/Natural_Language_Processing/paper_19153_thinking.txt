To extract datasets from the research paper titled "PRISE: Learning Temporal Action Abstractions as a Sequence Compression Problem" by Ruijie Zheng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors empirically show their method on a multitask set of robotic manipulation demonstrations, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will look for specific sections that typically contain dataset information, such as **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe their experimental setup. In this section, they mention evaluating their method on two multitask robotic manipulation benchmarks: **Metaworld** and **LIBERO**.

I will then gather detailed information about these datasets:

1. **Metaworld**: The authors state that they generate 100 expert trajectories for each pretraining task using a scripted policy. This dataset is used for multitask learning and is a benchmark for evaluating multi-task and meta reinforcement learning.

2. **LIBERO**: The authors describe using the LIBERO-90 dataset, which contains 50 demonstration trajectories for each task, collected by human teleoperation. This dataset is also used for evaluating multitask learning performance.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

- For **Metaworld**, the citation is:
  > Yu, T., Quillen, D., He, Z., Julian, R., Hausman, K., Finn, C., and Levine, S. *Meta-world: A benchmark and evaluation for multi-task and meta reinforcement learning*. In Conference on Robot Learning (CoRL), 2019. URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.10897.

- For **LIBERO**, the citation is:
  > Liu, B., Zhu, Y., Gao, C., Feng, Y., and Stone, P. *LIBERO: Benchmarking knowledge transfer for lifelong robot learning*. In Thirty-seventh Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems Datasets and Benchmarks Track, 2023. URL: https://openreview.net/forum?id=xzEtNSuDJk.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described clearly and includes the full citation for proper referencing. This will allow for easy access and verification of the datasets used in the research.
