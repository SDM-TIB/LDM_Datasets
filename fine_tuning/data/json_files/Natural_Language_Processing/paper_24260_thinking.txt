To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Live Video Captioning" by Eduardo Blanco-Fernández et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. In the abstract, the authors reference the **ActivityNet Captions dataset**, which is a strong indication that this dataset is central to their research.

Next, I will examine the **experimental evaluation section** (Section IV) to gather more details about the dataset. Here, the authors provide a comprehensive description of the **ActivityNet Captions dataset**, stating that it consists of 20,000 videos totaling 849 hours of video with 100,000 descriptions, each with start and end timestamps. This section confirms the dataset's significance in their experiments.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the **ActivityNet Captions dataset**. The citation is as follows:
> Fabian Caba Heilbron, Victor Escorcia, and J. C. Niebles. *ActivityNet: A large-scale video benchmark for human activity understanding*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 961–970, 2015.

Since the paper primarily focuses on this dataset, I will ensure to include it in my final output.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and full citation as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the dataset used in the research paper.
