To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MatrixCity: A Large-scale City Dataset for City-scale Neural Rendering and Beyond" by Yixuan Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the creation of a synthetic dataset called **MatrixCity**, which is a strong indication that this is the primary dataset of interest. The introduction further elaborates on the challenges of city-scale neural rendering and emphasizes the need for a comprehensive dataset, confirming that **MatrixCity** is indeed the focus.

Next, I will look into **section 3 (MatrixCity Dataset)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset. Here, they describe the dataset's construction, characteristics, and statistics. The key points include:

1. **MatrixCity**: This dataset contains 67,000 aerial images and 452,000 street-level images from two city maps, covering a total area of 28 kmÂ². The dataset includes various properties such as RGB images, depth maps, and normal maps, which are crucial for city-scale neural rendering tasks.

In the **experiments section**, the authors mention using the **MatrixCity** dataset for evaluating different neural rendering methods. This reinforces the importance of this dataset in their research.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the **MatrixCity** dataset. Since the dataset is created by the authors themselves, I will cite it as follows:

- **MatrixCity Dataset**:
  > Yixuan Li, Lihan Jiang, Linning Xu, Yuanbo Xiangli, Zhenzhi Wang, Dahua Lin, Bo Dai. *MatrixCity: A Large-scale City Dataset for City-scale Neural Rendering and Beyond*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2023.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry for **MatrixCity** and ensure that it is formatted correctly for any downstream processing or review.

In summary, the steps I followed include:
1. Reading the abstract and introduction to identify the primary dataset.
2. Examining the dataset section for detailed descriptions and statistics.
3. Retrieving the full citation from the references.

This structured approach ensures that I accurately capture all necessary details about the dataset while adhering to the importance of proper citation.
