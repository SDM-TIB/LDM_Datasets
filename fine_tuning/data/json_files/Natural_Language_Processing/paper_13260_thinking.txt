To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Crucial Feature Capture and Discrimination for Limited Training Data SAR ATR" by Chenwei Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on the **MSTAR** and **OpenSARShip** datasets, indicating that these are the primary datasets used in their research.

Next, I will look for specific sections that detail the datasets used. In the **Experiments and Results** section, the authors provide a comprehensive description of the datasets:

1. **MSTAR Dataset**: This dataset is described as a benchmark for SAR ATR, containing a large number of SAR images of ten different types of ground targets, including tanks and armored vehicles. The data was collected by the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency and the Air Force Research Laboratory.

2. **OpenSARShip Dataset**: This dataset is aimed at ship detection and classification, containing SAR images collected from Sentinel-1 under various environmental conditions. It includes 17 types of ships and is integrated with automatic identification system (AIS) messages for reliable labeling.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **MSTAR Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). *Moving and Stationary Target Acquisition and Recognition (MSTAR) Dataset*. Available: [MSTAR Dataset](https://www.darpa.mil).

- For the **OpenSARShip Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Zeng, L., Zhu, Q., Lu, D., Zhang, T., Wang, H., Yin, J., & Yang, J. (2021). "Dual-polarized SAR ship grained classification based on CNN with hybrid channel feature loss." *IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters*.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
