To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Histopathology Whole Slide Image Analysis with Heterogeneous Graph Representation Learning" by Tsai Hor Chan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments on three public TCGA benchmark datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 5) where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their evaluations. They mention using:

1. **TCGA–COAD**: This dataset is used for cancer staging and classification tasks, with 1304 cases for staging and 1434 cases for classification.
2. **TCGA–BRCA**: This dataset is also utilized for cancer staging and classification tasks, with 1328 cases for staging and 1712 cases for classification.
3. **TCGA–ESCA**: This dataset is used for cancer typing tasks, consisting of 213 cases.
4. **Camelyon 16**: This dataset is mentioned for evaluating localization ability, providing tumor mask annotations.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The TCGA datasets are typically cited as follows:

- For **TCGA–COAD** and **TCGA–BRCA**:
  > Weinstein, J. N., Collisson, E. A., Mills, G. B., et al. (2013). The Cancer Genome Atlas Pan-Cancer Analysis Project. *Nature Genetics*, 45(10), 1113-1120.

- For **TCGA–ESCA**:
  > Weinstein, J. N., Collisson, E. A., Mills, G. B., et al. (2013). The Cancer Genome Atlas Pan-Cancer Analysis Project. *Nature Genetics*, 45(10), 1113-1120.

- For **Camelyon 16**:
  > Ehteshami Bejnordi, B., Veta, M., Van Diest, P. J., et al. (2017). Diagnostic assessment of deep learning algorithms for detection of lymph node metastases in women with breast cancer. *JAMA*, 318(22), 2199-2210.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant datasets and their citations from the paper.
