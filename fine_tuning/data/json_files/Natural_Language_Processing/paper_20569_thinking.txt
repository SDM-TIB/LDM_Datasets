To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Building Accurate Translation-Tailored LLMs with Language Aware Instruction Tuning" by Changtong Zan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions experiments on **IWSLT and WMT benchmarks**, indicating that these are likely datasets used in the research.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4), where the authors describe their experimental setup. In **section 4.1 (Experimental Setup)**, they explicitly list the datasets used:

1. **WMT Dataset**: The authors state that they use the development sets from WMT2017 to WMT2020, which includes 51,000 translation sentence pairs across multiple language directions.

2. **IWSLT Dataset**: They mention collecting the IWSLT dataset, focusing on translation performance between non-English languages, and using 12,000 sentence pairs from the IWSLT 2017 training set.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **WMT Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Cettolo, M., Federico, M., Bentivogli, L., Niehues, J., Stüker, S., Sudoh, K., Yoshino, K., & Federmann, C. (2017). Overview of the IWSLT 2017 evaluation campaign. In *Proceedings of the International Workshop on Spoken Language Translation (IWSLT)*.

- For the **IWSLT Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Cettolo, M., Federico, M., Bentivogli, L., Niehues, J., Stüker, S., Sudoh, K., Yoshino, K., & Federmann, C. (2017). Overview of the IWSLT 2017 evaluation campaign. In *Proceedings of the International Workshop on Spoken Language Translation (IWSLT)*.

Both datasets are referenced in the context of their use in translation tasks, and the authors provide sufficient detail to confirm their relevance to the experiments conducted.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes its full citation for clarity and proper attribution.
