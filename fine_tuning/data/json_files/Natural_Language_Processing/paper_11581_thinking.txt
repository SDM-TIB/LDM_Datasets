To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multilingual Multiword Expression Identification Using Lateral Inhibition and Domain Adaptation" by Andrei-Marius Avram et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method using the **PARSEME corpus**, which is a strong indication that this is a key dataset.

Next, I will look for specific details about the **PARSEME dataset** in the **introduction** and **experimental settings** sections. In the introduction, the authors mention that the PARSEME corpus is annotated for verbal multiword expressions (VMWEs) in 26 languages. This suggests that the dataset is multilingual and has been used for their experiments.

In the **experimental settings section**, the authors provide a detailed description of the **PARSEME dataset version 1.2**, including the number of languages it covers (14 languages) and the types of multiword expressions it includes. They also mention the number of tokens and annotated VMWEs for each language, which is crucial information for understanding the dataset's scope.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the PARSEME dataset. The authors reference the dataset multiple times, and I will ensure to capture the most authoritative citation.

The citation for the PARSEME dataset is:
> Ramisch, C.; Cordeiro, S.R.; Savary, A.; Vincze, V.; Barbu Mititelu, V.; Bhatia, A.; Buljan, M.; Candito, M.; Gantar, P.; Giouli, V.; et al. Annotated Corpora and Tools of the PARSEME Shared Task on Semi-Supervised Identification of Verbal Multiword Expressions, 1.2 ed.; LINDAT/CLARIAH-CZ Digital Library at the Institute of Formal and Applied Linguistics (ÚFAL), Faculty of Mathematics and Physics, Charles University: Staré Město, Czech Republic, 2020.

Finally, I will compile the information about the dataset into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the PARSEME dataset as it is critical for proper attribution and further research.
