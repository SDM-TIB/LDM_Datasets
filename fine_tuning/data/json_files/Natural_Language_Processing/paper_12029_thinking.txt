To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Efficient Ground Vehicle Path Following in Game AI" by Rodrigue de Schaetzen and Alessandro Sestini, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly referenced. The abstract discusses the evaluation of the proposed path follower in a first-person shooter game, which suggests that there may be datasets related to vehicle performance or path following scenarios.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental setup section** (Section III), where the authors describe the experiments conducted to validate their proposed method. They mention using a specific game, "Battlefield 2042," as the platform for running experiments. However, they do not explicitly mention any publicly available datasets or provide details about any datasets used for training or testing.

I will also check the **results section** for any mention of datasets used in the experiments. The authors discuss the performance of their path follower across various vehicles and test paths, but again, there is no mention of specific datasets or their sources.

Since the paper does not provide any explicit datasets or references to datasets, I will look into the **references section** to see if any cited works include datasets that could be relevant. The references primarily consist of papers discussing algorithms and methodologies related to path following and vehicle control, but they do not appear to reference any specific datasets.

Given that the paper does not provide any datasets or their citations, I will conclude that there are no datasets to extract from this paper. Therefore, I will not be able to provide full citations for any datasets as none are mentioned.

In summary, I will document that no datasets were identified in the paper "Efficient Ground Vehicle Path Following in Game AI" by Rodrigue de Schaetzen and Alessandro Sestini, and thus, no citations can be provided.
