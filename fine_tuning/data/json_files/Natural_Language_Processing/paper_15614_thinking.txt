To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SC-MIL: Sparsely Coding Multiple Instance Learning for Whole Slide Image Classification" by Peijie Qiu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the experimental results were conducted on multiple datasets, which indicates that there are datasets to be identified.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly the subsection labeled **A. Dataset**. Here, the authors explicitly list the datasets used in their experiments. I will carefully note the details provided for each dataset, including their names, descriptions, and any relevant statistics.

The paper mentions the following datasets:

1. **Classical MIL benchmarks**: This includes five datasets: MUSK1, MUSK2, FOX, TIGER, and ELEPHANT. Each dataset is described in terms of its purpose and the nature of the bags and instances.

2. **CAMELYON16 dataset**: This dataset is described as a publicly available WSI dataset for detecting metastatic breast cancer in lymph node tissue, with specific details about the number of samples and annotations.

3. **TCGA-NSCLC dataset**: This dataset is used for identifying two sub-types of lung cancer, with details on the number of WSIs and patches extracted.

Now, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For the datasets mentioned, I will compile the following citations:

- For **CAMELYON16 dataset**, the citation is:
  > B. E. Bejnordi et al., "Diagnostic assessment of deep learning algorithms for detection of lymph node metastases in women with breast cancer," *Jama*, vol. 318, no. 22, pp. 2199–2210, 2017.

- For the **TCGA-NSCLC dataset**, the citation is not explicitly provided in the paper, but it is commonly referenced as:
  > The Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, "Comprehensive molecular profiling of lung adenocarcinoma," *Nature*, vol. 511, no. 7511, pp. 543–550, 2014.

The classical MIL benchmark datasets (MUSK1, MUSK2, FOX, TIGER, and ELEPHANT) do not have specific citations in the paper, but they are well-known datasets in the field of multiple instance learning. I will note that they are commonly referenced in the literature.

After gathering all this information, I will summarize the datasets and their citations in a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly identified with its respective citation for future reference. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the study and their significance in the context of the research.
