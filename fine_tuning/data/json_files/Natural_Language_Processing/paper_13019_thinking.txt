To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Simple and Efficient Partial Graph Adversarial Attack: A New Perspective" by Guanghui Zhu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study and may mention datasets used for experiments. The introduction typically outlines the context and significance of the research, which may include references to specific datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly the part where the authors describe their methodology and the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, the authors mention that they conducted extensive experiments on **four real-world benchmark datasets**: **Cora, Citeseer, CoraML, and Pubmed**. This is a clear indication that these datasets are central to the research.

I will then look for a **datasets section** or any part of the paper that provides detailed descriptions of these datasets, including their characteristics such as the number of nodes, edges, features, and classes. The paper includes a table (Table I) that summarizes the statistics of these datasets, which is crucial for understanding their scope and relevance.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is important for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

The full citations for the datasets mentioned in the paper are as follows:

1. **Cora Dataset**: 
   > Sen, P., Namata, G., Bilgic, M., Getoor, L., Galligher, J., & Eliassi-Rad, T. (2008). Collective classification in network data. *AI Magazine*, 29(3), 93-93.

2. **Citeseer Dataset**: 
   > Sen, P., Namata, G., Bilgic, M., Getoor, L., Galligher, J., & Eliassi-Rad, T. (2008). Collective classification in network data. *AI Magazine*, 29(3), 93-93.

3. **CoraML Dataset**: 
   > Kipf, T. N., & Welling, M. (2016). Semi-supervised classification with graph convolutional networks. *arXiv preprint arXiv:1609.02907*.

4. **Pubmed Dataset**: 
   > Sen, P., Namata, G., Bilgic, M., Getoor, L., Galligher, J., & Eliassi-Rad, T. (2008). Collective classification in network data. *AI Magazine*, 29(3), 93-93.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
