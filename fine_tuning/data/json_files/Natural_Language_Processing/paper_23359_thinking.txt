To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Probing Language Models for Pre-training Data Detection" by Zhenhua Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the introduction of a new benchmark called **ArxivMIA**, which suggests that there are datasets involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the need for detecting data contamination in large language models and mention the **WikiMIA** benchmark as well. This indicates that both **WikiMIA** and **ArxivMIA** are relevant datasets.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Data Construction)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the datasets. Here, they describe **ArxivMIA**, which consists of abstracts from the fields of Computer Science and Mathematics, and they also reference the **WikiMIA** dataset.

The paper specifies that **ArxivMIA** is constructed from abstracts published post-2024, with member data sourced from the **RedPajama dataset**. The authors highlight that **ArxivMIA** has 2000 samples and is designed to be a challenging benchmark for pre-training data detection.

In **section 5 (Experiments)**, the authors confirm that they evaluate their method on both **WikiMIA** and **ArxivMIA**, reinforcing the importance of these datasets in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to gather full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. For **WikiMIA**, the citation is:
   > Shi, W., et al. (2023). *Detecting pretraining data from large language models*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2310.16789.

2. For **ArxivMIA**, the citation is:
   > Liu, Z., Zhu, T., Tan, C., Lu, H., Liu, B., & Chen, W. (2023). *Probing Language Models for Pre-training Data Detection*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2310.18018.

3. For the **RedPajama dataset**, the citation is:
   > Together Computer. (2023). *Redpajama: an open dataset for training large language models*.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
