To extract datasets from the research paper titled "NoisyNN: Exploring the Impact of Information Entropy Change in Learning Systems" by Xiaowei Yu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of noise in deep learning systems and mentions experiments conducted on "large image datasets, such as ImageNet." This indicates that datasets are involved, but I need to find specific names and details.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (section 4) to find detailed descriptions of the datasets used. In this section, the authors mention conducting experiments on **ImageNet** and **TinyImageNet**. I will note these datasets as they are explicitly stated.

I will also check the **references section** to find full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, and Feifei Li. *ImageNet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In Proceedings of the IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pages 248â€“255, 2009.

- For **TinyImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Ya Le and Xuan Yang. *Tiny ImageNet Visual Recognition Challenge*. CS 231N 7, (7), 2015.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use.

In summary, the datasets extracted from the paper are:
1. **ImageNet** - A large-scale dataset used for image classification tasks.
2. **TinyImageNet** - A smaller version of ImageNet for visual recognition challenges.

I will ensure to include the full citations for both datasets in any subsequent documentation or output.
