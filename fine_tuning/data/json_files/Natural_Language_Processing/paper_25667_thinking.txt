To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Aggregated Attributions for Explanatory Analysis of 3D Segmentation Models" by Maciej Chrabaszcz et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the use of the **TotalSegmentator v2 dataset** for segmenting anatomical structures in CT scans, which indicates that this is a key dataset for the research.

Next, I will examine **section 4.1 (Setup)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention two datasets:

1. **TotalSegmentator v2**: This dataset is described as a comprehensive dataset for segmenting anatomical structures in 3D CT scans. It is crucial for the benchmarking of their proposed methodology.

2. **B50 Dataset**: This is a private dataset comprising 32 CT scans, used to analyze the model's performance in a real-world application.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **TotalSegmentator v2**, the citation is:
  > Jakob Wasserthal et al. *TotalSegmentator: Robust Segmentation of 104 Anatomic Structures in CT Images*. Radiology: Artificial Intelligence, 5:e230024, 2023.

- For the **B50 Dataset**, since it is a private dataset, it may not have a formal citation in the references. However, I will note that the authors mention it is available upon reasonable request.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citation for the TotalSegmentator v2 dataset and a note about the B50 dataset being private.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for further processing or review, ensuring that I have accurately captured the necessary details and citations.
