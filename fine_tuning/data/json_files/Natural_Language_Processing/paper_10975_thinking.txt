To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Cross-Domain Car Detection Model with Integrated Convolutional Block Attention Mechanism" by Haoxuan Xu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors used the **SSLAD dataset** for their experiments, which is a good starting point.

Next, I will look into **section 4.1 (Dataset)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the datasets used in their study. Here, they mention the **SODA10M dataset** as the primary training dataset. I will take note of the specifics provided about this dataset, including its characteristics and the number of images it contains.

In section 4.1, the authors describe the SODA10M dataset as follows:
- **SODA10M**: A high-quality driving scene dataset collected via crowdsourcing methods, consisting of ten million labeled images and twenty thousand unlabeled images, categorized into six primary car scene categories. The authors specifically used the car category for their training set.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the SODA10M dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:
> Han, Jianhua, et al. "SODA10M: a large-scale 2D self/Semi-supervised object detection dataset for autonomous driving." arXiv preprint arXiv:2106.11118 (2021).

Since the SSLAD dataset is mentioned in the abstract but not elaborated upon in the dataset section, I will also look for any references to it in the paper. If it is not cited in the references, I will note that it is used as a benchmark dataset but lacks a full citation.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, which is crucial for reproducibility and further research in the field.
