To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MELODY: Robust Semi-Supervised Hybrid Model for Entity-Level Online Anomaly Detection with Multivariate Time Series" by Jingchao Ni et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for evaluation. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used in their evaluations. In this section, I will look for specific mentions of datasets, including their characteristics, sizes, and any relevant details about how they were collected or labeled.

In the paper, the authors mention that they sampled real data of deployments from Amazon AWS, which is a significant dataset. They provide statistics about the dataset in **Table 1**, which includes:

- **Hard-Labeled set**: 4,966 entities, 234,508 time series, 288 anomalies (5.8%).
- **Soft-Labeled set**: 4,966 entities, 234,508 time series, 544 anomalies (11.0%).
- **Naive-Labeled set**: 4,688 entities, 220,320 time series, 544 anomalies (11.6%).
- **Unlabeled set**: 27,590 entities, 1,034,711 time series, no anomalies specified.

These details indicate the presence of multiple labeled datasets, which are crucial for the experiments conducted in the paper.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. Since the datasets are derived from Amazon AWS, I will look for any specific papers or reports that describe these datasets in detail. However, the paper does not provide explicit citations for the datasets themselves, as they are based on internal data from Amazon.

Given that the datasets are not formally published in the references, I will note that the dataset is derived from Amazon AWS deployments, and I will provide a general citation for the paper itself as the source of the dataset information.

The citation for the paper is:

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the relevant details and the citation for the paper as the source of the dataset information.
