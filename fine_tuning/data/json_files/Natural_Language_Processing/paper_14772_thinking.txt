To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Red Teaming Generative AI and Quantum Cryptography" by Petar Radanliev et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a high-level overview of the research and may mention key datasets used. The introduction often outlines the research objectives and may reference specific datasets that are central to the study.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, where the authors describe their approach in detail. This section is likely to contain explicit mentions of datasets, especially since the research involves AI/NLP models and quantum cryptographic protocols. I will look for any datasets that are used for training, testing, or validating the models.

In this paper, the authors mention using datasets from **Cornell ArXiv, Penn Treebank, and WikiText** for training their AI/NLP models. I will note these datasets as they are crucial for understanding the context of the research.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is important for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

The citations I will extract are:

1. **Cornell ArXiv**: 
   > Cornell University. *ArXiv: An Open Access Archive for Scholarly Articles*. Available: https://arxiv.org/

2. **Penn Treebank**: 
   > Marcus, M. P., Marcinkiewicz, M. A., & Santorini, B. (1993). *Building a Large Annotated Corpus of English: The Penn Treebank*. Computational Linguistics, 19(2), 313-330. Available: https://aclanthology.org/J93-2004

3. **WikiText**: 
   > Merity, S., Keskar, N. S., & Socher, R. (2016). *Regularizing and Optimizing LSTM Language Models*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1708.02182. Available: https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.02182

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that all relevant details are captured and can be easily referenced in future work.
