To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Participatory Personalization in Classification" by Hailey Joren et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted a comprehensive empirical study of participatory systems in clinical prediction tasks, which suggests that datasets are likely involved. I will look for specific mentions of datasets or references to data sources.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section 4) closely, as this is where datasets are typically detailed. In this section, the authors describe six classification tasks for clinical decision support, and they provide a table summarizing the datasets used. I will extract the names of the datasets, their characteristics, and any relevant metrics mentioned.

The datasets identified in the paper are:

1. **Apnea Dataset**: This dataset is used to predict obstructive sleep apnea and includes 1,152 patients with 26 features. The reference for this dataset is:
   > Ustun, B., Westover, M. B., Rudin, C., & Bianchi, M. T. (2016). Clinical prediction models for sleep apnea: the importance of medical history over symptoms. *Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine*, 12(02), 161-168.

2. **Cardio_eicu Dataset**: This dataset is used for predicting mortality in patients with cardiogenic shock and contains 1,341 records with 49 features. The reference is:
   > Pollard, T. J., Johnson, A. E. W., Raffa, J. D., Celi, L. A., Mark, R. G., & Badawi, O. (2018). The eICU collaborative research database, a freely available multi-center database for critical care research. *Scientific Data*, 5(1), 1-13.

3. **Cardio_mimic Dataset**: Similar to the cardio_eicu dataset, this one also predicts mortality in cardiogenic shock patients but contains 5,289 records. The reference is:
   > Johnson, A. E. W., Pollard, T. J., Shen, L., Li-Wei, H. L., Feng, M., Ghassemi, M., Moody, B., Szolovits, P., Celi, L. A., & Mark, R. G. (2016). MIMIC-III, a freely accessible critical care database. *Scientific Data*, 3(1), 1-9.

4. **Coloncancer Dataset**: This dataset is used to predict mortality within five years for colorectal cancer patients, containing 29,211 records with 72 features. The reference is:
   > Scosyrev, E., Messing, J., Noyes, K., Veazie, P., & Messing, E. (2012). Surveillance epidemiology and end results (SEER) program and population-based research in urologic oncology: an overview. *Urologic Oncology: Seminars and Original Investigations*, 30(2), 126-132.

5. **Lungcancer Dataset**: This dataset predicts mortality within five years for lung cancer patients and includes 120,641 records with 84 features. The reference is the same as for the colon cancer dataset:
   > Scosyrev, E., Messing, J., Noyes, K., Veazie, P., & Messing, E. (2012). Surveillance epidemiology and end results (SEER) program and population-based research in urologic oncology: an overview. *Urologic Oncology: Seminars and Original Investigations*, 30(2), 126-132.

6. **SAPS Dataset**: This dataset is used to predict ICU mortality and contains 7,797 records with 36 features. The reference is:
   > Allyn, J., Ferdynus, C., Bohrer, M., Dalban, C., Valance, D., & Allou, N. (2016). Simplified acute physiology score II as predictor of mortality in intensive care units: a decision curve analysis. *PloS One*, 11(10), e0164828.

After gathering this information, I will ensure that I have the full citations for each dataset, as they are crucial for proper attribution and further research.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy access and reference in future analyses or discussions.
