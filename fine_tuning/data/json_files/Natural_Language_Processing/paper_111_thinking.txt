To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Neural Machine Translation of Rare Words with Subword Units" by Rico Sennrich, Barry Haddow, and Alexandra Birch, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are referenced. The abstract mentions that the authors empirically show improvements in translation tasks, which suggests that they likely used specific datasets for their experiments.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors discuss their experiments on the WMT 2015 translation tasks, specifically for English to German and English to Russian translations. This indicates that the datasets used are likely related to these translation tasks.

In the **experiments section**, I will look for details about the datasets, such as their names, sizes, and any specific characteristics. The authors mention that they used a training set consisting of 4.2 million sentence pairs for English to German and 2.6 million sentence pairs for English to Russian. This gives me the names of the datasets used for their experiments.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for these datasets. The datasets used in the experiments are typically derived from the WMT (Workshop on Machine Translation) shared tasks. Therefore, I will look for the relevant WMT papers that describe these datasets.

For the English to German translation task, the citation is:
> Philipp Koehn, Hieu Hoang, Alexandra Birch, Chris Callison-Burch, Marcello Federico, Nicola Bertoldi, Brooke Cowan, Wade Shen, Christine Moran, Richard Zens, Chris Dyer, Ondřej Bojar, Alexandra Constantin, and Evan Herbst. *Moses: Open Source Toolkit for Statistical Machine Translation*. In Proceedings of the ACL-2007 Demo and Poster Sessions, pages 177–180, Prague, Czech Republic, 2007.

For the English to Russian translation task, the citation is:
> Barry Haddow, Matthias Huck, Alexandra Birch, Nikolay Bogoychev, and Philipp Koehn. *The Edinburgh/JHU Phrase-based Machine Translation Systems for WMT 2015*. In Proceedings of the Tenth Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation, pages 126–133, Lisbon, Portugal, 2015.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
