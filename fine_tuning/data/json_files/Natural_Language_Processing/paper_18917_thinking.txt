To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The Balancing Act: Unmasking and Alleviating ASR Biases in Portuguese" by Ajinkya Kulkarni et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and dataset description sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the use of Whisper and MMS systems, but I need to find specific datasets.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the need for fair AI solutions and mention biases in ASR systems, but they do not specify datasets yet. I will continue to the **dataset description section**.

In **section 2 (Dataset Description)**, the authors provide detailed information about the **Casual Conversation Dataset version 2 (CCD V2)**. They describe it as an open-source dataset with 5,567 unique speakers and a total of 26,467 video recordings. This section includes valuable details about the dataset's attributes, such as age, gender, and geographic location.

Next, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the CCD V2 dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:
> Bilal Porgali, Vítor Albiero, Jordan Ryda, Cristian Canton Ferrer, and Caner Hazirbas. *The casual conversations v2 dataset*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR) Workshops, pages 10–17, 2023.

Additionally, the paper mentions the **MMS dataset** and the **Whisper dataset**. I will look for their citations as well. The MMS dataset is described in the context of the MMS ASR system, and the citation is:
> Pratap, A., Tjandra, A., Shi, B., Tomasello, P., Babu, A., Kundu, S., Mamdouh, E., Ni, Z., Vyas, A., Fazel-Zarandi, M., Baevski, A., Adi, Y., Zhang, W.-N., Hsu, A., Conneau, A., and Auli, M. *Scaling speech technology to 1,000+ languages*. ArXiv, abs/2305.13516, 2023.

For the **Whisper dataset**, the citation is:
> Radford, A., Mcleavey, C., Sutskever, I., and Brockman, G. *Robust speech recognition via large-scale weak supervision*. In Proceedings of the 40th International Conference on Machine Learning, volume 202 of Proceedings of Machine Learning Research, pages 28492–28518, 2023.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. The datasets extracted from the paper are:

1. **Casual Conversation Dataset version 2 (CCD V2)**:
   - Citation: Bilal Porgali, Vítor Albiero, Jordan Ryda, Cristian Canton Ferrer, and Caner Hazirbas. *The casual conversations v2 dataset*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR) Workshops, pages 10–17, 2023.

2. **MMS Dataset**:
   - Citation: Pratap, A., Tjandra, A., Shi, B., Tomasello, P., Babu, A., Kundu, S., Mamdouh, E., Ni, Z., Vyas, A., Fazel-Zarandi, M., Baevski, A., Adi, Y., Zhang, W.-N., Hsu, A., Conneau, A., and Auli, M. *Scaling speech technology to 1,000+ languages*. ArXiv, abs/2305.13516, 2023.

3. **Whisper Dataset**:
   - Citation: Radford, A., Mcleavey, C., Sutskever, I., and Brockman, G. *Robust speech recognition via large-scale weak supervision*. In Proceedings of the 40th International Conference on Machine Learning, volume 202 of Proceedings of Machine Learning Research, pages 28492–28518, 2023.

With this information, I am ready to format the dataset entries as needed for further analysis or reporting.
