To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Computing Education in the Era of Generative AI" by Paul Denny et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the impact of AI on computing education but does not explicitly mention datasets. Therefore, I will proceed to the introduction.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges and opportunities presented by AI in computing education, but again, no specific datasets are mentioned. I will continue to the **methodology and results sections** to look for any datasets used in their evaluations or experiments.

Upon reaching the **experiments section**, I will look for any references to datasets used for evaluating the performance of code generation models. If the authors mention specific datasets, I will take note of their names, descriptions, and any relevant details about their structure or content.

Next, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned in the paper. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide a complete context for each dataset.

If the authors refer to datasets from other studies or papers, I will ensure to extract those citations as well. For example, if they reference datasets used in previous research, I will look up those studies to obtain the correct citations.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described clearly, including its name, purpose, and citation. This will involve summarizing the key points about each dataset and formatting the citations according to academic standards.

Finally, I will review the extracted information to ensure accuracy and completeness before finalizing the dataset entries for further processing or presentation.
