To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Developing Autonomous Robot-Mediated Behavior Coaching Sessions with Haru" by Matouš Jelínek, Eric Nichols, and Randy Gomez, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, method, results, and conclusion sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study but may not detail specific datasets. The introduction may reference previous studies or datasets used in the context of behavior change coaching with robots.

Next, I will focus on the **method section**, as it often contains detailed descriptions of the experimental setup, including any datasets used for training or evaluation. In this case, the authors mention conducting an experimental study with human participants (N=12), which suggests that there may be a dataset related to participant responses or interactions with the robot.

I will also check the **results section** for any mention of data collected during the experiments, such as participant demographics or feedback, which could indicate the existence of a dataset. The authors discuss the statistical analysis performed on the collected data, which implies that there is a dataset that includes participant responses and evaluations.

Finally, I will review the **references section** to find any citations related to datasets that may have been used in the study. This could include datasets from previous research that informed their methodology or were utilized in their experiments.

After gathering all relevant information, I will compile the datasets identified, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset. If specific datasets are not explicitly named in the text, I will note that as well.

Now, I will summarize the findings and prepare to create structured entries for each dataset, ensuring that I include the necessary citations for proper attribution.
