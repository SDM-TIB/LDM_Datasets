To extract datasets from the research paper titled "EX-Graph: A Pioneering Dataset Bridging Ethereum and X" by Qian Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract introduces **EX-Graph**, which is described as a novel dataset linking Ethereum and X, indicating that this is a primary dataset of interest.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Proposed Dataset)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the EX-Graph dataset. They describe it as a large-scale open-source dataset that integrates Ethereum transaction data with X following data. This section outlines the dataset's structure, including the number of nodes and edges, which is crucial for understanding its scope.

In **section 3.1 (Data Collection)**, the authors detail the data collection process, confirming that they gathered Ethereum transaction records and X account data. They mention specific numbers, such as **2,610,465 unique Ethereum addresses** and **29,585,858 transaction records**, which are important statistics to include in the dataset description.

Additionally, they mention collecting **1,445 labeled Ethereum addresses** known to participate in wash trading, which is another dataset of interest. This information is critical for understanding the dataset's applications in fraud detection.

I will also check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The authors reference their own dataset, EX-Graph, but I will also look for citations related to the data sources they used, such as OpenSea and Dune.

The citation for the EX-Graph dataset is:
> Wang, Q., Zhang, Z., Liu, Z., Lu, S., Luo, B., & He, B. (2024). EX-Graph: A Pioneering Dataset Bridging Ethereum and X. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR).

For the wash-trading addresses, the authors refer to data collected from Dune, which may not have a specific citation in the paper but can be referenced as:
> Dune Analytics. (2023). Wash-trading Ethereum addresses dataset. Retrieved from https://dune.com/queries/364051.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets extracted from the paper, ready for further processing or review.
