To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Understanding Visual Feature Reliance through the Lens of Complexity" by Thomas Fel et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract and introduction** sections. These sections often provide a summary of the research and may mention any datasets used for analysis or experiments. In this case, the abstract does not explicitly mention any datasets, so I will proceed to the introduction.

Next, I will carefully read through the **methodology and experiments sections**. These sections typically contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used, including their characteristics and how they were utilized in the study. I will look for any specific names of datasets or references to existing datasets.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention using the **ImageNet dataset** for training their model. This dataset is crucial for their analysis of feature complexity. I will note down the details provided about this dataset, including its significance in the context of the research.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the ImageNet dataset. The citation for the ImageNet dataset is as follows:
> Olga Russakovsky, Jia Deng, Hao Sheng, et al. *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 115(3):211â€“252, 2015.

Additionally, I will look for any other datasets mentioned throughout the paper. The authors may refer to other datasets in the context of their experiments or comparisons. However, after a thorough review, it appears that the primary dataset used is ImageNet.

Finally, I will compile the extracted information about the dataset into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the ImageNet dataset. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets referenced in the research paper.
