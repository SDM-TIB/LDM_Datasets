To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Challenging BIG-Bench tasks and whether chain-of-thought can solve them" by Mirac Suzgun et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions a focus on **23 challenging BIG-Bench tasks**, which suggests that there may be datasets associated with these tasks. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or references to prior works that might contain dataset information.

Next, I will examine the **Methods** and **Experiments** sections, as these typically provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the study. I will look for any sections specifically labeled as "Datasets" or similar, where the authors might describe the datasets in detail, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

In the **Results** section, I will check for any references to the performance of models on specific datasets, as this may provide additional context or confirm the datasets used in the experiments.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References** section to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to ensure that the datasets can be easily located by others.

Based on the information gathered, I will compile a list of datasets, including their names, descriptions, and full citations. For example, if the paper mentions the **BIG-Bench Hard (BBH)** tasks, I will ensure to include a citation for the original BIG-Bench paper as well as any other relevant datasets mentioned.

Finally, I will ensure that each dataset entry is clearly documented, including the full citation format, to maintain academic integrity and facilitate further research.

By following these steps, I will be able to extract and document the datasets effectively from the research paper.
