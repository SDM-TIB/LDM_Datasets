To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Don’t Make Your LLM an Evaluation Benchmark Cheater" by Kun Zhou et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of large language models (LLMs) and hints at the use of various benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors mention several evaluation benchmarks, including **MMLU**, **Big-Bench**, and **AGIEval**. I will note these names as potential datasets to investigate further.

In the **experiments section**, particularly in **section 2 (Empirical Study about Benchmark Leakage)**, the authors detail their experimental setup and mention specific datasets used for evaluation. They refer to:

1. **MMLU**: A benchmark for measuring multitask language understanding ability, covering 57 tasks across various domains.
2. **BoolQ**: A dataset for yes/no question answering.
3. **PIQA**: A dataset for reasoning about physical commonsense.
4. **Hellaswag**: A dataset for commonsense reasoning.
5. **WinoGrande**: Another dataset for commonsense reasoning.
6. **ARC Easy and Challenge**: Datasets for open book question answering.
7. **Open-BookQA**: A dataset for open book question answering.
8. **CommonsenseQA**: A commonsense reasoning dataset.
9. **GSM8k**: A dataset for mathematical reasoning.
10. **AQuA**: Another dataset for mathematical reasoning.
11. **RACE**: A reading comprehension dataset.
12. **CoQA**: A conversational question answering dataset.
13. **CMRC2018**: A Chinese machine reading comprehension dataset.
14. **C3-Dialog**: Another Chinese dataset for reading comprehension.

I will also check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. Here are the citations I will extract:

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and full citation for each dataset, ensuring that I have accurately represented the information as presented in the paper.
