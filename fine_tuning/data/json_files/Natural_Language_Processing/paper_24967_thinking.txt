To extract datasets from the research paper titled "GMC: A General Framework of Multi-stage Context Learning and Utilization for Visual Detection Tasks" by Xuan Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the framework is evaluated on various visual detection tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved. I will look for specific mentions of datasets in these sections.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Tasks and Experiments)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they explicitly mention three datasets:

1. **Storefront Accessibility Image Dataset (SAI)**: This dataset is collected from Google Street View and focuses on storefront accessibility, containing images labeled for doors, knobs, and stairs.

2. **CityPersons Dataset**: This dataset is derived from the Cityscapes dataset and includes annotations for pedestrians and riders in urban environments.

3. **MSCOCO Dataset**: A well-known benchmark dataset for object detection and instance segmentation, containing a wide variety of object categories.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

- For the **Storefront Accessibility Image Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Wang, X., Chen, J., Tang, H., Zhu, Z. (2022). *Multiclu: Multi-stage context learning and utilization for storefront accessibility detection and evaluation*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Multimedia Retrieval, Association for Computing Machinery, New York, NY, USA, pp. 304–312. DOI: 10.1145/3512527.3531361.

- For the **CityPersons Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Zhang, S., Benenson, R., Schiele, B. (2017). *Citypersons: A diverse dataset for pedestrian detection*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 3213–3221.

- For the **MSCOCO Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Lin, T.Y., Maire, M., Belongie, S., Hays, J., Perona, P., Ramanan, D., Dollár, P., Zitnick, C.L. (2014). *Microsoft COCO: Common objects in context*. In European Conference on Computer Vision, Springer, pp. 740–755.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described with its name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will help in accurately documenting the datasets used in the research paper.
