To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fault Detection for Agents on Power Grid Topology Optimization: A Comprehensive Analysis" by Malte Lehna et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract indicates that the authors collected failed chronics from three different agents in the WCCI 2022 L2RPN environment, which suggests that there is a dataset involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Contribution)**, where the authors mention aggregating data from over 40k failed chronics from three different agents. This section provides a clear indication of the dataset's size and context but does not specify the dataset's name.

In **section 5.2 (General Data Collection)**, the authors describe the WCCI 2022 L2RPN environment and the IEEE118 grid, indicating that the data collected includes 1662 chronics, which were run multiple times with different seeds. This section provides crucial details about the dataset's origin and structure.

I will also check **section 6 (Results)**, where the authors discuss the clustering results and the performance of various forecasting models. They mention the dataset's characteristics but do not provide additional datasets.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The key dataset identified is:

1. **WCCI 2022 L2RPN Environment**: This dataset is derived from the IEEE118 grid and is used for training and evaluating the agents. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Donnot, B. (2020). *Grid2Op: A testbed platform to model sequential decision making in power systems*. Retrieved from https://GitHub.com/rte-france/grid2op

2. **IEEE118 Grid**: While not a dataset in the traditional sense, it is a well-known benchmark in power systems research. The citation for the IEEE118 grid is:
   > IEEE Power and Energy Society. (2006). *IEEE 118 Bus Test Case*. Retrieved from https://www2.ece.ohio-state.edu/~baran/IEEE118/

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations. This will ensure that the datasets are properly documented for future reference or analysis.
