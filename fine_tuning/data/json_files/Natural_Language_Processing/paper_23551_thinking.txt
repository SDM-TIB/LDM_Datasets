To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Optimizing Photometric Light Curve Analysis: Evaluating Scipy's Minimize Function for Eclipse Mapping of Cataclysmic Variables" by Anoop Kumar et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and experimental analysis sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of optimization techniques for analyzing photometric light curves, which suggests that datasets related to light curves may be involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention using photometric data from databases such as **Kepler's MAST**. This indicates that there is a specific dataset being utilized for their analysis.

Next, I will look closely at the **materials and methods section**. Here, the authors describe the **Binary class**, which maintains data for a binary star system, specifically mentioning two files: **parameters.csv** and **light_curve_data.csv**. The light_curve_data.csv file contains observed light curve data, which is crucial for their analysis.

In the **experimental analysis section**, the authors refer to the **light curve data from the binary star KIC 201325107**, indicating that this specific dataset is being analyzed in their experiments. They also mention that the parameters for this binary star were established using the Phoebe modeling tool, which suggests that the dataset is derived from a well-known source.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The relevant citations are:

1. For the **Kepler's MAST** dataset, the citation is:
   > "Kepler Data Archive." NASA Exoplanet Science Institute. [Online]. Available: https://archive.stsci.edu/missions-and-data/kepler

2. For the **KIC 201325107** dataset, the citation is:
   > "APS - Joint Fall 2017 Meeting of the Texas Section of the APS, Texas Section of the AAPT, and Zone 13 of the Society of Physics Students - Kepler K2 Observations and Modelling of Algol-type binary KIC201325017." [Online]. Available: https://meetings.aps.org/Meeting/TSF17/Event/311791

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all necessary details are captured for future reference or analysis.
