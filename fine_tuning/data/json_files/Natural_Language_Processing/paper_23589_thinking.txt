To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Frequency-based Matcher for Long-tailed Semantic Segmentation" by Shan Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors constructed three representative datasets for long-tailed semantic segmentation, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section III (Long-tailed Semantic Segmentation)**, particularly **subsection B (Dataset Design)**, where the authors describe the datasets they constructed. Here, they mention three datasets:

1. **ADE20K-Full**: An extended version of the ADE20K dataset, which is described as a natural long-tailed semantic segmentation dataset with 874 classes.

2. **COCO-Stuff-LT**: A long-tailed version of the COCO-Stuff dataset, which retains the original number of classes (171) but is sampled to exhibit long-tailed characteristics.

3. **MHP-v2-LT**: A long-tailed version of the MHP-v2 dataset, which also maintains the original number of classes (59) and is designed for human-centric segmentation tasks.

In the same section, the authors provide statistics and details about the datasets, confirming their purpose and the nature of the annotations.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. Based on the information provided in the paper, I can derive the following citations:

- For **ADE20K**:
  > B. Zhou, H. Zhao, X. Puig, S. Fidler, A. Barriuso, and A. Torralba. *Scene parsing through ADE20K dataset*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2017, pp. 633–641.

- For **COCO-Stuff**:
  > H. Caesar, J. Uijlings, and V. Ferrari. *Coco-stuff: Thing and stuff classes in context*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2018, pp. 1209–1218.

- For **MHP-v2**:
  > J. Zhao, J. Li, Y. Cheng, T. Sim, S. Yan, and J. Feng. *Understanding humans in crowded scenes: Deep nested adversarial learning and a new benchmark for multi-human parsing*. In Proceedings of the 26th ACM International Conference on Multimedia, 2018, pp. 792–800.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This includes ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its citation, which is crucial for proper attribution in any subsequent work.
