To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Building One-class Detector for Anything: Open-vocabulary Zero-shot OOD Detection Using Text-image Models" by Yunhao Ge et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method on "challenging benchmarks including large-scale datasets," which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors discuss the challenges of out-of-distribution (OOD) detection and mention using datasets like **CIFAR100 vs CIFAR10** and **ImageNet vs Places365**. This gives me a clue that these datasets are relevant to their evaluation.

In the **experiments section**, the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for evaluation. They state that they evaluate their method on the **ImageNet-1K dataset validation split** and the **ImageNet-Multilabel dataset**. The ImageNet-1K dataset is a well-known benchmark in computer vision, while the ImageNet-Multilabel dataset is used for evaluating OOD detection in mixed images.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For **ImageNet-1K**, the citation is:
   > Olga Russakovsky, Jia Deng, Hao Su, Jonathan Krause, Sanjeev Satheesh, Sean Ma, Zhiheng Huang, Andrej Karpathy, Aditya Khosla, Michael Bernstein, Alexander C. Berg, and Li Fei-Fei. *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision (IJCV), 115(3):211â€“252, 2015. doi: 10.1007/s11263-015-0816-y.

2. For **ImageNet-Multilabel**, the citation is:
   > Vaishaal Shankar*, Rebecca Roelofs*, Horia Mania, Alex Fang, Benjamin Recht, and Ludwig Schmidt. *Evaluating machine accuracy on ImageNet*. ICML, 2020.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets and their citations clearly.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that is ready for review or further processing, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its full citation.
