To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Implementation of Linear Parameter Varying System to Investigate the Impact of Varying Flow Rate on the Lithium-ion Batteries Thermal Management System Performance" by Pedram Rabiee and Mohammad Hassan Saidi, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, results, and discussions sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus, but I need to look for specific datasets in the main body of the paper.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the need for reduced-order models (ROMs) in battery thermal management, but they do not explicitly mention any datasets. I will continue to the **methodology** section, where they describe the modeling approach and the experimental data used for the LG P1.4 battery cell.

Next, I will check the **results and discussions sections** for any references to datasets or experimental data. The authors mention using experimental data for the LG P1.4 battery cell, which is crucial for understanding the thermal management system's performance. However, they do not provide a specific dataset name or citation.

I will also look at the **figures and tables** throughout the paper, particularly **Table 1** and **Table 2**, which list thermodynamic properties and grid values for scheduling parameters. These tables do not represent datasets in the traditional sense but provide important numerical data relevant to the study.

Finally, I will consult the **references section** to identify any datasets that may have been used in the study. The authors reference several papers that could contain relevant datasets, particularly those related to battery thermal management and modeling.

After reviewing the references, I will compile the relevant citations for the datasets mentioned or implied in the paper:

1. For the **LG P1.4 battery cell**, the citation is:
   > G. L. Plett, *Battery Management Systems. Volume 1, Battery Modeling*. ArtTech House, 2016.

2. For the experimental data used in the study, I will reference the following paper:
   > K. E. Thomas, C. Bogatu, and J. Newman, “Measurement of the Entropy of Reaction as a Function of State of Charge in Doped and Undoped Lithium Manganese Oxide,” *J. Electrochem. Soc.*, vol. 148, no. 6, p. A570, 2001.

3. Additionally, I will include the reference for the thermal management optimization:
   > G. Fan, K. Pan, G. L. Storti, M. Canova, J. Marcicki, and X. G. Yang, “A Reduced-Order Multi-Scale, Multi-Dimensional Model for Performance Prediction of Large-Format Li-Ion Cells,” *J. Electrochem. Soc.*, vol. 164, no. 2, pp. A252–A264, 2017.

Now, I will summarize the findings and prepare to create structured entries for each dataset, ensuring that I include the full citations as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets referenced in the paper.
