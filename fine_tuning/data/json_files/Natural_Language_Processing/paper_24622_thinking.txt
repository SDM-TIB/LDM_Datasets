To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Self-Supervised Spatial-Temporal Normality Learning for Time Series Anomaly Detection" by Yutong Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments on five popular TSAD benchmarks, which indicates that specific datasets will be discussed later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors provide a summary of the datasets used in **section 4.1 (Experimental Setup)**. Here, they list five datasets along with their statistics, which is crucial for understanding the context in which the datasets were used.

The datasets mentioned are:

1. **PSM (Pooled Server Metrics Dataset)**: This dataset is used for IT system monitoring signals from eBay server machines. It contains 25 dimensions.

2. **MSL (Mars Science Laboratory Dataset)**: Collected by NASA, this dataset includes sensor and actuator data from the Mars Rover, with 27 entities.

3. **SMAP (Soil Moisture Active Passive Dataset)**: Another NASA dataset, it contains soil samples and telemetry information from a satellite, with 55 entities.

4. **Epilepsy Dataset**: This dataset is collected from a triaxial accelerometer on a human subject's wrist, focusing on activities like walking and running as normal data, while seizures are treated as anomalies.

5. **DSADS (Daily and Sports Activities Dataset)**: This dataset collects motion sensor data from eight subjects performing various daily and physical activities, with intense activities classified as anomalies.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are essential for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. 

The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **PSM**, the citation is:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or processing.
