To extract datasets from the research paper titled "How Do Neural Spoofing Countermeasures Detect Partially Spoofed Audio?" by Tianchi Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on partially spoofed audio and mentions the use of datasets for training countermeasures (CMs). This indicates that datasets are likely discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors explicitly mention the use of the **PartialSpoof dataset**. They describe it as a publicly accessible database that provides detailed timestamp annotations for both speech and non-speech parts, as well as transition regions. This section confirms that the PartialSpoof dataset is central to their experiments.

I will also check the **results and discussion sections** to see if any other datasets are referenced or compared. In this case, the authors mention the **ASVspoof 2019 LA dataset** in relation to their findings, indicating that it is another dataset relevant to their work.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset from the **References section**:

1. For the **PartialSpoof dataset**, the citation is:
   > L. Zhang, X. Wang, E. Cooper, N. Evans, and J. Yamagishi. "The PartialSpoof database and countermeasures for the detection of short fake speech segments embedded in an utterance." *IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing*, vol. 31, pp. 813â€“825, 2023.

2. For the **ASVspoof 2019 LA dataset**, the citation is:
   > X. Wang et al. "ASVspoof 2019: A large-scale public database of synthesized, converted and replayed speech." *Computer Speech and Language*, vol. 64, p. 101114, 2020.

After collecting this information, I will summarize the datasets in a clear format, ensuring that each dataset is described with its citation included. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
