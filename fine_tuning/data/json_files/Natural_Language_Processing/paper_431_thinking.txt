To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Training Temporal Word Embeddings with a Compass" by Valerio Di Carlo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that experiments were conducted using "state-of-the-art datasets and methodologies," which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly the subsections where datasets are likely to be described. In this paper, the authors mention two main datasets used for testing their model: **News Article Corpus Small (NAC-S)** and **News Article Corpus Large (NAC-L)**. I will note the details provided about these datasets, including their sizes and the time spans they cover.

In **Table 1**, the authors summarize the characteristics of the datasets:
- **NAC-S**: Contains 50 million words, spans from 1990 to 2016, and has 27 slices.
- **NAC-L**: Contains 668 million words, spans from 1987 to 2007, and has 21 slices.
- Additionally, the **Machine Learning Papers Corpus (MLPC)** is mentioned, which contains 6.5 million words and spans from 2007 to 2015.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For **NAC-S**, the citation is:
> Yao, Z., Sun, Y., Ding, W., Rao, N., & Xiong, H. (2018). Dynamic word embeddings for evolving semantic discovery. In Proceedings of the Eleventh ACM International Conference on Web Search and Data Mining, 673–681. ACM.

For **NAC-L**, the citation is:
> Sandhaus, E. (2008). The New York Times Annotated Corpus.

For **MLPC**, the citation is:
> Rudolph, M., & Blei, D. (2018). Dynamic embeddings for language evolution. In WWW, 1003–1011.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described with its relevant details and full citations. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, which is essential for reproducibility and further research in the field.
