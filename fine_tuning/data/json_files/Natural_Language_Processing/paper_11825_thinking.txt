To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Formal Perspective on Byte-Pair Encoding" by Vilém Zouhar et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly referenced. The abstract primarily discusses the theoretical aspects of Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) and does not mention any datasets. 

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any references to datasets used in experiments or evaluations. The introduction discusses the popularity of BPE in NLP but does not provide specific dataset names.

I will then look into the **experiments or results sections** (if available) to see if the authors conducted empirical evaluations that involve datasets. However, the provided text does not seem to contain a dedicated experiments section that lists datasets.

Since the paper focuses on theoretical aspects and algorithmic improvements rather than empirical results, it is likely that no specific datasets are mentioned. I will also check the **references section** to see if any datasets are cited indirectly through other works. 

After reviewing the entire paper, I find that there are no datasets explicitly mentioned or referenced. Therefore, I will conclude that this paper does not provide any datasets for extraction.

In summary, I will document my findings as follows:
- No datasets were identified in the paper "A Formal Perspective on Byte-Pair Encoding" by Vilém Zouhar et al. 

This process highlights the importance of thoroughly reviewing all sections of a research paper to ensure that any datasets are not overlooked, even if they are not the primary focus of the work.
