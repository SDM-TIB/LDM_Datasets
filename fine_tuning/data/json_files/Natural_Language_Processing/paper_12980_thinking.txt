To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DFM-X: Augmentation by Leveraging Prior Knowledge of Shortcut Learning" by Shunxin Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information accurately, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the use of a data augmentation strategy called DFM-X but does not specify any datasets. However, the introduction discusses the importance of mitigating shortcut learning and hints at the use of datasets for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used in their experiments. Here, I will find the following datasets mentioned:

1. **CIFAR-10**: This dataset is described as containing 50,000 training images and 10,000 testing images across 10 classes. It is a well-known benchmark in the field of image classification.

2. **CIFAR-C**: This is a corrupted variant of CIFAR-10, which includes 19 corrupted subsets categorized into different types of corruptions (e.g., noise, blur, weather, digital transformations). The paper states that CIFAR-C is used for evaluating corruption robustness.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*, Apr 2009.

- For **CIFAR-C**, the citation is:
  > Dan Hendrycks and Thomas Dietterich. *Benchmarking neural network robustness to common corruptions and perturbations*. Proceedings of the International Conference on Learning Representations, 2019.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations.
