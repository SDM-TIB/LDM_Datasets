To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Weakly Supervised Learners for Correction of AI Errors with Provable Performance Guarantees" by Ivan Y. Tyukin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the methodology but does not specify any datasets. Therefore, I will move on to the **introduction**.

In the introduction, the authors discuss the challenges of AI errors and the need for correction methods, but they do not mention specific datasets. Next, I will check the **methodology section** and **section V (Example: AI Correctors for Pottery Classification)**, where they describe the application of their approach to pottery classification.

In section V, the authors mention the use of images of ceramic pieces from Dragendorff forms Dr27, Dr33, Dr35, Dr37, and Dr38 for training their core classifier. This indicates that there is a dataset related to pottery classification.

Next, I will look for any tables or figures that summarize the datasets used. I find **Table I**, which lists the real images available for training, validation, and testing performance of the core pottery classifier. The table provides the number of images for each class, which is crucial information for dataset extraction.

Additionally, the authors mention a synthetic dataset containing 80,640 images for training, 10,080 images for validation, and 10,080 images for testing. This synthetic dataset is also important to document.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper cites a reference for the Dragendorff forms:

- For the Dragendorff forms, the citation is:
  > P. Webster, *Roman Samian Pottery in Britain*. Council for British Archaeology, 1996, vol. 13.

The synthetic dataset does not have a specific citation since it is generated data, but I will note that it is a synthetic dataset created for the study.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for the datasets identified. The datasets extracted are:

1. **Real Images of Ceramic Pieces**: Images from Dragendorff forms Dr27, Dr33, Dr35, Dr37, and Dr38.
   - Citation: P. Webster, *Roman Samian Pottery in Britain*. Council for British Archaeology, 1996, vol. 13.

2. **Synthetic Dataset**: 80,640 images for training, 10,080 images for validation, and 10,080 images for testing.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring that each dataset is clearly documented with its citation.
