To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Building Specialized Generalist AI with System 1 and System 2 Fusion" by Kaiyan Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract provides a high-level overview, and the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the research, which may include references to datasets used in the study.

Next, I will examine the **methodology and experiments sections**. These sections typically provide detailed information about the datasets used, including their names, characteristics, and how they were utilized in the research. I will look for specific mentions of datasets, including any tables or figures that summarize their details.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily. I will ensure that I note the authors, title, publication venue, and year for each dataset.

In this paper, I will specifically look for datasets mentioned in the context of specialized generalist AI, particularly those referenced in discussions about LLMs (Large Language Models) and their applications in various domains.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their full citations, ensuring that each entry is complete and formatted correctly.

Finally, I will summarize the findings in a clear and organized manner, ready for further processing or review.
