To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Learning Geometric Eigen-Lengths Crucial for Fitting Tasks" by Yijia Weng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the research focus and any datasets that may be mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors set up a benchmark suite including tasks, data, and evaluation metrics, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will look for specific sections that typically contain dataset information, such as **section 4 (Can Geometric Eigen-Lengths be Learned from Binary Task Supervision?)** and **section 4.1 (Testbed for Eigen-Length Learning)**. In these sections, the authors describe the tasks and the datasets used for training and evaluation.

In **section 4.1**, the authors mention that they curated a set of tasks and built a large-scale dataset comprising diverse shapes and configurations. They specifically mention using approximately 1200 common household object models from ShapeNet, which is a significant dataset for their experiments.

I will also check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper cites the following:

1. **ShapeNet**: 
   > Chang, A. X., Funkhouser, T., Guibas, L., Hanrahan, P., Huang, Q., Li, Z., Savarese, S., Savva, M., Song, S., Su, H., et al. *ShapeNet: An information-rich 3D model repository*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1512.03012, 2015.

Additionally, I will note that the authors generated around 75K training data and 20K testing data for each task, which indicates the scale of their dataset.

Now, I will summarize the datasets identified:

1. **ShapeNet Dataset**: A collection of 3D models used for training and evaluation in various fitting tasks. It includes approximately 1200 common household object models.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for clarity and ensure that the citations are complete and accurate. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
