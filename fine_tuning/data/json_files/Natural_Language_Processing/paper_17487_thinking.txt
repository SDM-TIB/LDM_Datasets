To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Does religiosity influence corporate greenwashing behavior?" by Mathieu Gomes et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and empirical analysis sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a concise overview of the study's focus, which hints at the data used, specifically mentioning a "large sample of US firms between 2005 and 2019." This suggests that there is a dataset related to US firms and their greenwashing behavior.

Next, I will examine the **methodology section** (Section 3) where the authors describe their sample selection process. They mention using data from the **American Religion Data Archive (ARDA)** for religiosity measures and **Trucost** for environmental disclosures. This indicates that both ARDA and Trucost are datasets utilized in the research.

In the **empirical analysis section**, the authors detail how they derived their measures of greenwashing and religiosity, confirming the use of these datasets. They also mention the number of firm-year observations (6,650) and the specific years covered (2005-2019), which further clarifies the dataset's scope.

Now, I will compile the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

1. **American Religion Data Archive (ARDA)**: This dataset is used for measuring religiosity based on the number of religious adherents in US counties. The citation for ARDA is:
   > American Religion Data Archive. *Religious Congregations Membership Study (RCMS)*. Retrieved from https://www.thearda.com/Archive/Files/Descriptions/RCMS.asp

2. **Trucost**: This dataset provides environmental disclosure data for firms. The citation for Trucost is:
   > Trucost. *Environmental Data*. Retrieved from https://www.trucost.com/

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets in a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly identified along with its citation. This will facilitate easy reference and verification for anyone reviewing the research paper's methodology and data sources.
