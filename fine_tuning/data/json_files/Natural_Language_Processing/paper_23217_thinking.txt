To extract datasets from the research paper titled "FMARS: Annotating Remote Sensing Images for Disaster Management Using Foundation Models" by E. Arnaudo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study provides a large-scale dataset with labels derived from the Maxar Open Data initiative, which suggests that this dataset is significant for the research.

Next, I will look into the **Materials and Methods** section, specifically under **3.2 Data Sources**, where the authors describe the dataset construction process. Here, they mention that the FMARS dataset includes imagery from **19 disaster events** and provides details about the source of the imagery, which is the Maxar Open Data Program. This section is crucial as it outlines the specifics of the dataset, including the number of events and the area covered.

I will also check **Table 2**, which lists the events included in the FMARS dataset, along with their respective years and total surface coverage. This table provides concrete details about the dataset's composition.

In addition, I will look for any references to other datasets that may have been used in the study. The authors mention the **xBD dataset** in the context of disaster management, which is relevant for understanding the scope of their work. 

Now, I will gather the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. **FMARS Dataset**: The citation for the FMARS dataset is not explicitly provided in the references, but it is derived from the Maxar Open Data initiative. Therefore, I will cite it as:
   > Maxar. *Maxar Open Data Program*. 2017. Available at: https://www.maxar.com/open-data

2. **xBD Dataset**: The citation for the xBD dataset is:
   > Ritwik Gupta, Bryce Goodman, Nirav Patel, Ricky Hosfelt, Sandra Sajeev, Eric Heim, Jigar Doshi, Keane Lucas, Howie Choset, and Matthew Gaston. "Creating xBD: A Dataset for Assessing Building Damage from Satellite Imagery." In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops, 2019, pp. 10â€“17.

3. **Maxar Open Data Events**: While the FMARS dataset is based on the Maxar Open Data, the specific events are detailed in Table 2. I will summarize the events but will not create a separate citation for each since they are part of the FMARS dataset.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and that the citations are accurate and complete. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
