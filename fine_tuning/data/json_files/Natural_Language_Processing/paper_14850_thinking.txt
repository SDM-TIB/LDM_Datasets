To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Robust Multi-Modal Reasoning via Model Selection" by Xiangyan Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract states that the authors created a new dataset called **MS-GQA** to investigate model selection challenges in multi-modal agents. This is a clear indication that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will check the **experiments section** where the authors discuss the MS-GQA dataset in detail. They mention that MS-GQA is constructed using the GQA dataset (Hudson & Manning, 2019) and focuses on various subtask types, particularly "LOC" (Localization, Text-guided Object Detection) and "VQA" (Visual Question Answering). This section provides valuable insights into the dataset's purpose and structure.

In the **related work section**, the authors reference existing datasets and benchmarks that are relevant to their study. However, the primary focus is on the MS-GQA dataset, which they created for their specific research needs.

Now, I will compile the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. **MS-GQA**: This is the new dataset created by the authors. The citation for this dataset is not provided in the references, but I will note that it is a significant contribution of this paper.

2. **GQA Dataset**: The citation for the GQA dataset is:
   > Hudson, A. & Manning, C. D. (2019). *GQA: A new dataset for real-world visual reasoning and compositional question answering*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pp. 6700â€“6709.

After identifying these datasets and their citations, I will ensure that I have accurately documented the purpose and details of each dataset as described in the paper. This will help in creating a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for review, ensuring that each dataset is clearly defined and properly cited for future reference or downstream processing.
