To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Large Language Models are Temporal and Causal Reasoners for Video Question Answering" by Dohwan Ko et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their framework on five challenging VideoQA benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they mention the following datasets:

1. **NExT-QA**: This dataset is described as containing about 5,000 videos with an average length of 44 seconds and 48,000 question-answer pairs. It includes three types of questions: causal, temporal, and descriptive.

2. **DramaQA**: This dataset features video story understanding with 24,000 video clips and 18,000 question-answer pairs, focusing on hierarchical difficulty levels.

3. **STAR**: This dataset is designed for situational reasoning and contains 60,000 question-answer pairs across 22,000 video clips.

4. **VLEP**: This dataset uses TV shows and YouTube vlogs, comprising 29,000 question-answer pairs and 10,000 video clips.

5. **TVQA**: Built on long video clips from six different TV shows, this dataset provides 153,000 question-answer pairs and 22,000 video clips.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:

- For **NExT-QA**, the citation is:

- For **DramaQA**, the citation is:

- For **STAR**, the citation is:
  > Wu, B., Yu, S., Chen, Z., Tenenbaum, J. B., & Gan, C. (2021). STAR: A benchmark for situated reasoning in real-world videos. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS).

- For **VLEP**, the citation is:

  > Lei, J., Yu, L., Berg, T. L., & Bansal, M. (2018). TVQA: Localized, compositional video question answering. In Proceedings of the Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP).

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or analysis.
