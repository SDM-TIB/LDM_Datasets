To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Self-Distillation Improves DNA Sequence Inference" by Tong Yu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors validated their approach using the **human reference genome** and applied it to **20 downstream inference tasks**. This suggests that multiple datasets may be involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, which is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, the authors mention that they conducted experiments on datasets from three different benchmark sources: **GenomicBenchmarks**, **Genome Understanding Evaluation (GUE)**, and **MTcDNA**. 

I will look for specific datasets listed in **subsection 4.3 (GenomicBenchmarks)** and **subsection 4.4 (GUE Benchmarks)**. The authors provide a table (Table 1) that lists various tasks and their corresponding datasets, including:

1. **Mouse Enhancers**: A dataset used for enhancer prediction tasks.
2. **Human vs Worm**: A dataset comparing human and worm genomic sequences.
3. **Human Regulatory**: A dataset focused on human regulatory elements.
4. **Human Nontata Promoters**: A dataset for predicting non-TATA box promoters.
5. **Human OCR Ensembl**: A dataset related to open chromatin regions.

In **subsection 4.4**, the authors mention the **GUE benchmark**, which includes datasets for **Epigenetic Marks Prediction** and **Virus classification**. They specifically refer to the **Covid dataset**, which is used to classify different Covid variants.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. The paper cites several sources that may provide the necessary details for the datasets mentioned. 

For example, the **GenomicBenchmarks** dataset is referenced as:
> Katarína Grešová, Vlastimil Martinek, David Čechák, Petr Šimeček, and Panagiotis Alexiou. *Genomic benchmarks: a collection of datasets for genomic sequence classification*. BMC Genomic Data, 24(1):25, 2023.

The **GUE benchmark** is referenced as:
> Daoan Zhang, Weitong Zhang, Bing He, Jianguo Zhang, Chenchen Qin, and Jianhua Yao. *DNAGPT: A generalized pretrained tool for multiple DNA sequence analysis tasks*. bioRxiv, pages 2023–07, 2023.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and includes its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
