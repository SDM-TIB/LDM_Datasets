To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "StackOverflowVQA" by Motahhare Mirzaei et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** to identify any mention of datasets. The abstract introduces the **StackOverflowVQA dataset**, which is a key focus of the paper. This indicates that there is at least one dataset to extract.

Next, I will read through the **introduction** section, which provides context about the dataset. It mentions that the StackOverflowVQA dataset includes questions from StackOverflow that have accompanying images and multiple human-generated answers. This reinforces the importance of the dataset in the context of Visual Question Answering (VQA).

I will then move to the **Datasets section** (section 2), where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets they developed. Here, I will find three specific datasets:

1. **StackOverflowVQA**: This dataset includes 451,394 questions with corresponding answers, specifically focusing on questions that have at least one image. The dataset is significant because it provides multiple full-sentence answers for most questions.

2. **StackOverflowVQA-filtered**: This version contains questions that have only one image and an accepted answer, totaling 204,574 question-answer pairs. This dataset is filtered to ensure quality and relevance.

3. **StackOverflowVQA-filtered-small**: A smaller subset of the filtered dataset, which includes 18,412 training and 2,046 testing question-answer pairs. This version is designed to be manageable for fine-tuning models.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The paper mentions that the StackOverflowVQA dataset was developed by processing the dataset from Mike (2023), which is available on Hugging Face. Therefore, I will cite it as follows:

- For **StackOverflowVQA**:
  > Mike. 2023. Mikex86/stackoverflow-posts Â· datasets at Hugging Face. URL: [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/mikex86/stackoverflow-posts).

The other two datasets are derived from the main StackOverflowVQA dataset, so they will reference the same source.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will prepare the information for structured output or further processing.
