To extract datasets from the research paper titled "COVID-CT-H-UNet: a novel COVID-19 CT segmentation network based on attention mechanism and Bi-category Hybrid loss" by Anay Panja et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the paper focuses on a segmentation network for COVID-19 CT images, which suggests that a specific dataset is likely used for training and evaluation.

Next, I will look closely at **section 4 (Experimental Results)**, where the authors mention that there is a single COVID-19 CT segmentation dataset available for their experiments. They specify that this dataset consists of 20 CT scans, annotated by radiologists, which is crucial information for understanding the dataset's context and application.

In the same section, the authors provide a reference to the dataset, which is essential for citation purposes. They refer to it as the "COVID-19 CT segmentation dataset" and provide a URL for access: https://medicalsegmentation.com/covid19/. This indicates that the dataset is publicly available and can be cited accordingly.

Now, I will compile the full citation for the dataset based on the information provided in the paper:

- **COVID-19 CT Segmentation Dataset**: 
  > "Covid-19 ct segmentation dataset." Available at: https://medicalsegmentation.com/covid19/. 2020.

This citation includes the title of the dataset, the URL for access, and the year of publication, which is critical for proper referencing.

After gathering this information, I will prepare to format the dataset entry according to the required structure, ensuring that the citation is included accurately.

In summary, I have identified the dataset used in the paper, confirmed its details, and retrieved the necessary citation for it. I will now proceed to format this information as needed for further processing.
