To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ResMatch: Residual Attention Learning for Local Feature Matching" by Yuxin Deng and Jiayi Ma, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments, which suggests that datasets are likely involved. I will look for any specific names or descriptions of datasets in these sections.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as it typically contains detailed information about the datasets used for evaluation. In this paper, the authors mention evaluating their methods on three datasets: **FM-Bench**, **YFCC100M**, and **ScanNet**. I will take note of any specific details provided about these datasets, such as their characteristics or the number of images involved.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide a brief description of each dataset:

1. **FM-Bench**: This dataset comprises four subsets (CPC, T&T, TUM, and KITTI) covering various scenarios like driving and indoor SLAM. It contains 4000 pairs of images.

2. **YFCC100M**: This dataset contains 100 million outdoor photos collected from the Internet, along with 72 3D models reconstructed using the Structure-from-Motion (SfM) pipeline. The authors selected 4000 pairs of images from 4 models for testing.

3. **ScanNet**: This is a comprehensive indoor dataset composed of monocular sequences with ground-truth poses and depth images. The authors selected 1500 wide-baseline pairs of images for testing.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **FM-Bench**, the citation is:
  > Jia-Wang Bian, Yu-Huan Wu, Ji Zhao, Yun Liu, Le Zhang, Ming-Ming Cheng, and Ian Reid. *An evaluation of feature matchers for fundamental matrix estimation*. In Proceedings of the British Machine Vision Conference, 2019.

- For **YFCC100M**, the citation is:
  > Bart Thomee, David A Shamma, Gerald Friedland, Benjamin Elizalde, Karl Ni, Douglas Poland, Damian Borth, and Li-Jia Li. *YFCC100M: The new data in multimedia research*. Communications of the ACM, 59(2):64–73, 2016.

- For **ScanNet**, the citation is:
  > Angela Dai, Angel X Chang, Manolis Savva, Maciej Halber, Thomas Funkhouser, and Matthias Nießner. *ScanNet: Richly-annotated 3D reconstructions of indoor scenes*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 5828–5839, 2017.

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
