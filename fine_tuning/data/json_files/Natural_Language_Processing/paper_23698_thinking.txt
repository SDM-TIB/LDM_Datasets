To extract datasets from the research paper titled "GAIA: Rethinking Action Quality Assessment for AI-Generated Videos" by Zijian Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract introduces the GAIA dataset, which is a key focus of the paper, indicating that it is likely to be described in detail later.

Next, I will look for specific sections that discuss datasets. In this paper, the **Datasets section** is likely to provide comprehensive details about GAIA. I will pay attention to the number of videos, the nature of the data (AI-generated), and the evaluation metrics used.

In the **Dataset Acquisition section**, the authors describe the GAIA dataset in detail. They mention that GAIA consists of **9,180 AI-generated videos** from **18 text-to-video models**, along with **971,244 human ratings** across various action categories. This section confirms that GAIA is the primary dataset used in their research.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the GAIA dataset. The authors do not provide a separate citation for GAIA since it is their own dataset, but they do reference the text-to-video models used to generate the videos. I will compile the citations for these models as they are relevant to the dataset's creation.

The relevant citations for the text-to-video models mentioned in the paper are:

Now, I will summarize the dataset information and its citation:

- **GAIA Dataset**: A dataset consisting of 9,180 AI-generated videos from 18 text-to-video models, with 971,244 human ratings collected for action quality assessment.

- **Citations for Text-to-Video Models**: I will compile the citations for the models used to generate the videos in GAIA, as listed above.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare to format it according to the required structure for downstream processing or review.
