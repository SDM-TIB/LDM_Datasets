To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Textbook Remedy for Domain Shifts: Knowledge Priors for Medical Image Analysis" by Yue Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method on a broad range of domain shifts across **20 datasets**, which suggests that multiple datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they categorize the datasets into two groups: **confounded datasets** and **unconfounded datasets**. 

In **subsection 5.1 (Datasets)**, the authors provide a detailed list of the datasets used:

1. **Confounded Datasets**:
   - **NIH-CXR**: A dataset of chest X-rays with various confounding factors.
   - **CheXpert**: Another chest X-ray dataset with attributes for confounding.
   - **ISIC**: A dataset for skin lesion images, also with confounding factors.

2. **Unconfounded Datasets**:
   - **Pneumonia Dataset**: A dataset for pneumonia detection in chest X-rays.
   - **COVID-QU**: A dataset for COVID-19 detection in chest X-rays.
   - **Open-i**: A dataset of chest X-rays.
   - **VinDr-CXR**: Another dataset of chest X-rays.
   - **HAM10000**: A dataset for skin lesion classification.
   - **BCN20000**: Another skin lesion dataset.
   - **PAD-UFES-20**: A dataset for skin lesions.
   - **Melanoma**: A dataset specifically for melanoma detection.
   - **UWaterloo**: A skin lesion dataset.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. 

For example:
- **NIH-CXR**: 
  > Johnson, A. E. W., Pollard, T. J., Berkowitz, S. J., Greenbaum, N. R., Lungren, M. P., Deng, C.-y., Mark, R. G., & Horng, S. (2019). MIMIC-CXR, a de-identified publicly available database of chest radiographs with free-text reports. *Scientific Data*, 6(1), 317.

- **CheXpert**: 
  > Irvin, J., Rajpurkar, P., Ko, M., Yu, Y., Ciurea-Ilcus, S., Chute, C., Marklund, H., & Haghgoo, B. (2019). CheXpert: A large chest radiograph dataset with uncertainty labels and expert comparison. In *Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence* (Vol. 33, pp. 590-597).

- **HAM10000**: 
  > Tschandl, P., Rosendahl, C., & Kittler, H. (2018). The HAM10000 dataset, a large collection of multi-source dermatoscopic images of common pigmented skin lesions. *Scientific Data*, 5(1), 1-9.

Once I have gathered the necessary information and citations, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This systematic approach ensures that I accurately capture all relevant datasets and their citations from the paper.
