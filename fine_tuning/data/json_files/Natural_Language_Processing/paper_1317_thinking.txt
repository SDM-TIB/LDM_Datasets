To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Quality of Word Embeddings on Sentiment Analysis Tasks" by Erion Çano and Maurizio Morisio, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract indicates that the authors compare various pretrained word embedding models on two sentiment analysis tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Sentiment Analysis Tasks)**, where the authors detail the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention:

1. **AM628**: This dataset consists of 771 song texts collected from the AllMusic portal, annotated with positive and negative sentiments. The authors balanced the dataset to have 314 positive and 314 negative lyrics.

2. **ML3K**: This dataset contains 3,000 mood-labeled songs from various genres and epochs, as described in a previous work by the authors.

3. **MR10K**: A subset of a larger dataset, this contains 10,000 movie reviews categorized as positive or negative.

4. **MR50K**: This is a larger dataset containing 50,000 movie reviews, also categorized as positive or negative.

In the **results section**, the authors discuss the performance of their models on these datasets, confirming their relevance to the experiments conducted.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

- For **AM628**, the citation is:
  > R. Malheiro, R. Panda, P. Gomes, and R. P. Paiva. *Emotionally-relevant features for classification and regression of music lyrics*. IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing, PP(99):1–1, 2016.

- For **ML3K**, the citation is:
  > E. Çano and M. Morisio. *Moodylyrics: A sentiment annotated lyrics dataset*. In 2017 International Conference on Intelligent Systems, Metaheuristics and Swarm Intelligence, Hong Kong, March 2017.

- For **MR10K**, the citation is:
  > B. Pang, L. Lee, and S. Vaithyanathan. *Thumbs up? sentiment classification using machine learning techniques*. In Proceedings of EMNLP, pages 79–86, 2002.

- For **MR50K**, the citation is:
  > B. Pang and L. Lee. *A sentimental education: Sentiment analysis using subjectivity*. In Proceedings of ACL, pages 271–278, 2004.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented for further processing or review.
