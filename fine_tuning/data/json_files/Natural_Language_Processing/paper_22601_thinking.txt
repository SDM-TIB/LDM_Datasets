To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Model-Free Unsupervised Anomaly Detection Framework in Multivariate Time-Series of Industrial Dynamical Systems" by Mazen Alamira and RaphaÃ«l Dion, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and examples sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses a new anomaly detection framework and mentions that two examples are provided to assess its efficiency. This suggests that datasets are likely included in the examples.

Next, I will focus on the **examples section** (Section 4), where the authors describe two specific use cases:

1. **Lorentz Attractor Dataset**: The authors mention that this dataset is accessible at a specific GitHub link. This indicates that it is a publicly available dataset used for testing their anomaly detection framework.

2. **Automotive Electronic Throttle Control Dataset**: Similarly, this dataset is also mentioned to be freely accessible at another GitHub link. This confirms that it is another dataset utilized in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. Since the datasets are hosted on GitHub, I will note the URLs provided in the paper:

- For the **Lorentz Attractor Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Alamir, M. (2023). *Lorentz Attractor Blind Fault Detection Dataset*. Retrieved from https://github.com/mazenalamir/lorentz-atractor-blind-fault-detection-dataset

- For the **Automotive Electronic Throttle Control Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Alamir, M. (2023). *ETC Dataset for Blind Fault Detection*. Retrieved from https://github.com/mazenalamir/ETC_dataset_BFD

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations as required. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
