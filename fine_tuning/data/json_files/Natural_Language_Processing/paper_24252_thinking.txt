To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Evaluating n-Gram Novelty of Language Models Using RUSTY-DAWG" by William Merrill et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the development of RUSTY-DAWG and its application to measure the novelty of text generated by language models, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental setup section (Section 4)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. In **Section 4.1**, they mention that they built a CDAWG on the **Pile**, which is a large dataset used for training language models. The Pile is described as containing various types of text, including web text, books, code, and email communication.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the Pile dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:

- For **The Pile**:
  > Leo Gao, Stella Biderman, Sid Black, Laurence Golding, Travis Hoppe, Charles Foster, Jason Phang, Horace He, Anish Thite, Noa Nabeshima, Shawn Presser, and Connor Leahy. *The Pile: An 800GB dataset of diverse text for language modeling*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2101.00027, 2020.

Additionally, the authors reference the **Pythia models** trained on the Pile, which are also relevant to the datasets discussed. The citation for the Pythia models is:

- For **Pythia**:
  > Stella Biderman, Hailey Schoelkopf, Quentin Gregory Anthony, Herbie Bradley, Kyle O’Brien, Eric Hallahan, Mohammad Aflah Khan, Shivanshu Purohit, USVSN Sai Prashanth, Edward Raff, et al. *Pythia: A suite for analyzing large language models across training and scaling*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Machine Learning, pages 2397–2430. PMLR, 2023.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required.

1. **The Pile**: A large dataset containing diverse text types for language modeling.
   - Citation: Leo Gao, Stella Biderman, Sid Black, Laurence Golding, Travis Hoppe, Charles Foster, Jason Phang, Horace He, Anish Thite, Noa Nabeshima, Shawn Presser, and Connor Leahy. *The Pile: An 800GB dataset of diverse text for language modeling*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2101.00027, 2020.

2. **Pythia Models**: A suite of models trained on the Pile dataset.
   - Citation: Stella Biderman, Hailey Schoelkopf, Quentin Gregory Anthony, Herbie Bradley, Kyle O’Brien, Eric Hallahan, Mohammad Aflah Khan, Shivanshu Purohit, USVSN Sai Prashanth, Edward Raff, et al. *Pythia: A suite for analyzing large language models across training and scaling*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Machine Learning, pages 2397–2430. PMLR, 2023.

After gathering this information, I will ensure that the dataset entries are structured appropriately for any further processing or review.
