To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Is word segmentation necessary for Vietnamese sentiment classification?" by Duc-Vu Nguyen and Ngan Luu-Thuy Nguyen, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on two corpora related to Vietnamese sentiment classification, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors discuss the importance of word segmentation in Vietnamese sentiment analysis and mention various studies that utilized different datasets. This section may provide insights into the specific datasets used in their experiments.

In the **experimental setup section**, the authors explicitly mention the two datasets they used for their experiments:

1. **VLSP2016-SA corpus**: This dataset consists of technical article reviews from news and social media, which is used for sentiment analysis. The authors provide statistics about the dataset, including the number of samples for training, validation, and testing.

2. **UIT-VSFC corpus**: This dataset is related to educational surveys and is also used for sentiment analysis. Similar to the VLSP2016-SA corpus, the authors provide detailed statistics about the samples in this dataset.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations I will extract are:

- For the **VLSP2016-SA corpus**:
  > H. T. M. Nguyen, H. V. Nguyen, Q. T. Ngo, L. X. Vu, V. M. Tran, B. X. Ngo, and C. A. Le. "VLSP SHARED TASK: SENTIMENT ANALYSIS." *Journal of Computer Science and Cybernetics*, vol. 34, no. 4, p. 295–310, Jan. 2019.

- For the **UIT-VSFC corpus**:
  > K. V. Nguyen, V. D. Nguyen, P. X. V. Nguyen, T. T. H. Truong, and N. L.-T. Nguyen. "UIT-VSFC: Vietnamese Students’ Feedback Corpus for Sentiment Analysis." In *2018 10th International Conference on Knowledge and Systems Engineering (KSE)*, 2018, pp. 19–24.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details and that the citations are accurate and complete.
