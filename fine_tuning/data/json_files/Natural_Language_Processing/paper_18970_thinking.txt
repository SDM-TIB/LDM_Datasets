To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multimodal Learned Sparse Retrieval for Image Suggestion" by Thong Nguyen, Mariya Hendriksen, and Andrew Yates, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, but the details about datasets are likely to be found in the experiments section.

In the **experiments section**, the authors mention conducting experiments on the **AToMiC dataset**, which is described as having around 11 million images and more than 10 million text queries collected from Wikipedia. This dataset is crucial for understanding the context of their experiments.

Next, I will look for the **full citation** of the AToMiC dataset in the **References section**. The relevant citation is:

- **AToMiC Dataset**: 
  > Jheng-Hong Yang, Carlos Lassance, Rafael Sampaio De Rezende, Krishna Srinivasan, Miriam Redi, Stéphane Clinchant, and Jimmy Lin. *AToMiC: An Image/Text Retrieval Test Collection to Support Multimedia Content Creation*. In Proceedings of the 46th International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval, pages 2975–2984, 2023.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the dataset details:

1. **AToMiC Dataset**: This dataset contains approximately 11 million images and over 10 million text queries sourced from Wikipedia. Each text query consists of four fields: page_title, section_title, context_page_description, and context_section_description. For the experiments, the authors used only the 4.4 million text-image pairs provided by the dataset's authors.

With this information, I can now prepare the dataset entry for the JSON output, ensuring that the citation is included for proper referencing. This structured approach allows me to extract and document datasets effectively from research papers.
