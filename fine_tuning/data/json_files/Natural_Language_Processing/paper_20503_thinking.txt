To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Bootstrapping Reinforcement Learning with Imitation for Vision-Based Agile Flight" by Jiaxu Xing et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a concise overview of the research and may mention any datasets used. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets, while the methodology and experiments sections typically detail how the datasets were utilized.

In the **abstract**, the authors discuss their experiments in both simulated and real-world environments, which suggests that they likely used specific datasets for training and evaluation. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any references to datasets. The authors may describe the challenges of vision-based learning and the need for specific datasets to validate their approach. If they mention any datasets, I will note their names and any relevant details.

Moving on to the **methodology section**, I will look for a dedicated subsection on datasets. This section often provides detailed descriptions of the datasets used, including their sizes, types, and any specific characteristics that are relevant to the study. If the authors mention any datasets here, I will extract that information.

In the **experiments section**, I will check for any additional references to datasets used for training and testing the models. This section may also include performance metrics related to the datasets, which can provide further context.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. It is crucial to ensure that I have the correct and complete citations for each dataset, as this will be important for any future work or replication studies.

For example, if the authors mention using a dataset like the "Habitat simulator" or "Agilicious platform," I will look for the corresponding citations in the references section to provide accurate attribution.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, including their names, descriptions, and citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and cite the datasets used in the research paper, which is essential for maintaining academic integrity and facilitating further research in the field.
