To extract datasets from the research paper titled "LAN: Learning Adaptive Neighbors for Real-Time Insider Threat Detection" by Xiangrui Cai et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluated their method on two widely used datasets, specifically **CERT r4.2** and **CERT r5.2**. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for understanding the experiments conducted.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **Datasets section** or any mention of these datasets in the **experiments section**. In the introduction, the authors highlight the significance of these datasets for their evaluation, which reinforces their importance.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide detailed statistics about the datasets. They describe **CERT r4.2** as containing user activity data from 1,000 employees, with a total of 32,770,222 activities, including 7,316 abnormal activities. Similarly, **CERT r5.2** is described as containing data from 2,000 employees, with 79,856,664 activities, including 10,306 abnormal activities. This information is essential for understanding the datasets' scale and context.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The paper cites the datasets as follows:

- For **CERT r4.2**, the citation is:
  > CERT. "CERT Insider Threat Center: CERT r4.2 Dataset." [Online]. Available: https://www.cert.org/insider-threat/insider-threat-datasets.cfm. Accessed: 2020.

- For **CERT r5.2**, the citation is:
  > CERT. "CERT Insider Threat Center: CERT r5.2 Dataset." [Online]. Available: https://www.cert.org/insider-threat/insider-threat-datasets.cfm. Accessed: 2020.

With this information, I can now compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations as required.

In summary, I will extract the following datasets:

1. **CERT r4.2**
   - Description: Contains user activity data from 1,000 employees, with 32,770,222 activities, including 7,316 abnormal activities.
   - Citation: CERT. "CERT Insider Threat Center: CERT r4.2 Dataset." [Online]. Available: https://www.cert.org/insider-threat/insider-threat-datasets.cfm. Accessed: 2020.

2. **CERT r5.2**
   - Description: Contains user activity data from 2,000 employees, with 79,856,664 activities, including 10,306 abnormal activities.
   - Citation: CERT. "CERT Insider Threat Center: CERT r5.2 Dataset." [Online]. Available: https://www.cert.org/insider-threat/insider-threat-datasets.cfm. Accessed: 2020.

After gathering all this information, I will format it according to the specified requirements for further processing or review.
