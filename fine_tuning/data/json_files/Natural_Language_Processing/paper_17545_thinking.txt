To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Merging Vision Transformers from Different Tasks and Domains" by Peng Ye et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the work involves merging various Vision Transformers (ViTs) trained on different tasks or domains, which suggests that multiple datasets are likely involved. I will look for any specific dataset names mentioned in these sections.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (section 4) closely, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, the authors explicitly list the datasets they used, which is crucial for my extraction process.

Upon reviewing section 4.1 (Datasets), I find that the authors mention **16 different datasets** used in their experiments. I will list these datasets along with any relevant details provided, such as the number of classes or specific characteristics that may be useful for understanding their application.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is critical, as proper citation is essential for academic integrity and for others to locate the datasets.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for easy reference and ensure that each dataset is properly cited as per academic standards.
