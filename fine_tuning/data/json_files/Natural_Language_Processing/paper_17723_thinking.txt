To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Automated Classification of Model Errors on ImageNet" by Momchil Peychev et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of models on the **ImageNet dataset**, which is a significant clue that this dataset is central to the research.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any additional datasets or variations mentioned. The authors reference **ImageNet** multiple times, indicating its importance in their analysis. They also mention the challenges associated with label noise and ambiguity in ImageNet, which suggests that they may have used modified versions or additional datasets for their experiments.

In the **experiments section**, I will look for any specific datasets used for evaluation. The authors mention that they evaluated their automated error classification framework on **over 900 models**, primarily using the **ImageNet dataset**. They also reference other datasets like **IMAGENET-A**, which is a dataset of natural adversarial examples designed to challenge classifiers.

I will also check the **related work section** for any additional datasets that may have been introduced by other researchers and referenced by the authors. The paper discusses various datasets that have been used in the context of error analysis, including **SALIENT IMAGENET** and **HARD IMAGENET**, which are designed to highlight specific error types.

After identifying the datasets, I will compile the full citations for each dataset from the **References section** of the paper. The citations for the datasets I have identified are as follows:

1. **ImageNet**:
   > J. Deng, W. Dong, R. Socher, L. Li, K. Li, and F. Li. "Imagenet: A large-scale hierarchical image database." In Proceedings of CVPR, 2009.

2. **IMAGENET-A**:
   > D. Hendrycks, K. Zhao, S. Basart, J. Steinhardt, and D. Song. "Natural adversarial examples." In Proceedings of CVPR, 2021.

3. **SALIENT IMAGENET**:
   > S. Singla and S. Feizi. "Salient imagenet: How to discover spurious features in deep learning?" In Proceedings of ICLR, 2022.

4. **HARD IMAGENET**:
   > M. Moayeri, S. Singla, and S. Feizi. "Hard imagenet: Segmentations for objects with strong spurious cues." In Proceedings of NeurIPS, 2022.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will prepare to format this information according to the required structure for further processing or review.
