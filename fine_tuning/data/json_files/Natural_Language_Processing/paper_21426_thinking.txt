To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The Effectiveness of a Simplified Model Structure for Crowd Counting" by Lei Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the proposed model is trained and evaluated on four widely used public datasets. This indicates that there are specific datasets that I need to identify.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this case, the paper includes a **Table I** that lists the datasets used for evaluation, which is a crucial source of information.

In **Table I**, I will find the following datasets:

1. **UCF CC 50**: This dataset contains 50 images with a total of 63,974 marked persons, an average of 1,279 marked persons per image, and an average resolution of 2101 × 2888 pixels.

2. **ShanghaiTech Part A (SHA)**: This dataset consists of 482 images with 241,677 marked persons, averaging 501 marked persons per image, and an average resolution of 589 × 868 pixels.

3. **ShanghaiTech Part B (SHB)**: This dataset includes 716 images with 88,488 marked persons, averaging 123 marked persons per image, and an average resolution of 768 × 1024 pixels.

4. **NWPU-Crowd**: This dataset has 5,109 images with a total of 2,133,375 marked persons, averaging 418 marked persons per image, and an average resolution of 2191 × 3209 pixels.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations may not always be explicitly listed for datasets, but I will look for any papers or sources that describe these datasets.

For the datasets mentioned, I will provide the following citations based on the references in the paper:

- **UCF CC 50**:

- **ShanghaiTech Dataset**:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations.
