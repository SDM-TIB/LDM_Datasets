To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "Program-Aided Reasoners (Better) Know What They Know" by Anubha Kabra et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental design sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their methods on **five datasets**, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experimental Design)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. They list five datasets covering different reasoning tasks, which are summarized in **Table 1**. The datasets mentioned are:

1. **GSM8K**: This dataset is used for arithmetic reasoning and contains 1,319 samples.
2. **GSM8K Hard**: A more challenging version of GSM8K, also containing 1,319 samples.
3. **Date Understanding**: A symbolic reasoning dataset with 360 samples.
4. **Object Counting**: An algorithmic reasoning dataset with 250 samples.
5. **Repeat Copy**: Another algorithmic reasoning dataset with 32 samples.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were utilized for their experiments, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:

- For **GSM8K**, the citation is:
  > Karl Cobbe, Vineet Kosaraju, Mohammad Bavarian, Jacob Hilton, Reiichiro Nakano, Christopher Hesse, and John Schulman. *Training verifiers to solve math word problems*. ArXiv, abs/2110.14168, 2021.

- For **GSM8K Hard**, the citation is:
  > Luyu Gao, Aman Madaan, Shuyan Zhou, Uri Alon, Pengfei Liu, Yiming Yang, Jamie Callan, and Graham Neubig. *PAL: Program-aided language models*. ArXiv, abs/2211.10435, 2022.

- For **Date Understanding**, the citation is:
  > Mirac Suzgun et al. *Challenging big-bench tasks and whether chain-of-thought can solve them*. ArXiv, abs/2210.09261, 2022.

- For **Object Counting**, the citation is:
  > Mirac Suzgun et al. *Challenging big-bench tasks and whether chain-of-thought can solve them*. ArXiv, abs/2210.09261, 2022.

- For **Repeat Copy**, the citation is:
  > Mirac Suzgun et al. *Challenging big-bench tasks and whether chain-of-thought can solve them*. ArXiv, abs/2210.09261, 2022.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. Each dataset will be described with its name, category, number of samples, and the full citation.
