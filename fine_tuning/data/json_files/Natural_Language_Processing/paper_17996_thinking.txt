To extract datasets from the research paper titled "One Agent Too Many: User Perspectives on Approaches to Multi-agent Conversational AI" by Christopher Clarke et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and conclusion** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract states that the authors released two datasets, which indicates that I should look for details about these datasets in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **main body of the paper**, particularly the sections where the authors discuss their experiments and findings. In the **contributions section**, they explicitly mention the release of two datasets:

1. **User Study Dataset**: This dataset contains questions asked by participants, the returned agent responses, and subjective user satisfaction ratings (yes/no) regarding the acceptability of the agent responses.

2. **Crowd-sourced Dataset**: This dataset includes queries containing agent responses and human ground truth selections, which were collected through Amazon Mechanical Turk.

I will then check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. However, since these datasets are likely not published in separate papers, I will note that the datasets are part of the supplementary materials associated with this research paper.

The citations for the datasets will be as follows:

- For the **User Study Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Clarke, C., Krishnamurthy, K., Talamonti, W., Kang, Y., Tang, L., & Mars, J. (2021). One Agent Too Many: User Perspectives on Approaches to Multi-agent Conversational AI. *Journal of LaTeX Class Files*, 14(8), 1-14.

- For the **Crowd-sourced Dataset**, the citation is the same as above since both datasets are released in conjunction with the paper.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the necessary details and citations for each dataset in the appropriate format for further processing or review.
