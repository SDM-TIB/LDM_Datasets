To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Joint Space Neural Probabilistic Language Model for Statistical Machine Translation" by Tsuyoshi Okita, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention any datasets used. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets, while the experimental sections typically detail the datasets used for evaluation.

In the **introduction**, the author discusses the application of the neural probabilistic language model (NPLM) in statistical machine translation (SMT) and mentions the use of a training corpus of **500,000 sentence pairs**. This indicates that a dataset is involved, but I need to find the specific name of the dataset.

Next, I will check the **experimental sections** for any explicit mentions of datasets. In **section 4 (Intrinsic Evaluation)**, the author states that they trained the language model using the **Europarl** dataset, which consists of bilingual sentence pairs. This is a significant dataset for machine translation tasks.

I will also look for any additional datasets mentioned in the **extrinsic evaluation** section. The author refers to the **ML4HMT-2012** dataset, which provides multiple translation outputs for evaluation. This dataset is crucial for understanding the performance of the proposed methods.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **Europarl dataset**, the citation is:
   > Philipp Koehn. *Europarl: A Parallel Corpus for Statistical Machine Translation*. In Proceedings of the 10th Machine Translation Summit, pages 79–86, 2005.

2. For the **ML4HMT-2012 dataset**, the citation is:
   > MaTrEx. *The DCU MT System for WMT 2009*. In Proceedings of the Third EACL Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation, pages 95–99, 2009.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately documented the datasets used in the research paper along with their full citations.
