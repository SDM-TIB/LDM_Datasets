To extract datasets from the research paper titled "E(3)-Equivariant Actor-Critic Methods for Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning" by Dingyang Chen and Qi Zhang, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview, and the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the datasets used.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors mention using benchmarks from the **Multi-Agent Particle Environment (MPE)** and **MuJoCo continuous control tasks**. These are key indicators that datasets are involved.

In the **experiments section**, the authors describe the environments used for their experiments, specifically mentioning:
1. **Multi-Agent Particle Environment (MPE)**: This is a well-known benchmark for multi-agent reinforcement learning, which includes various scenarios like Cooperative Navigation, Cooperative Push, and Predator and Prey.
2. **MuJoCo continuous control tasks**: This includes tasks like cartpole, single- and multi-agent reacher, and swimmer, which are also standard benchmarks in reinforcement learning.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets or benchmarks. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **Multi-Agent Particle Environment (MPE)**, the citation is:
  > Lowe, R., Wu, Y. I., Tamar, A., Harb, J., Abbeel, O. P., & Mordatch, I. (2017). Multi-agent actor-critic for mixed cooperative-competitive environments. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems (pp. 6379â€“6390).

- For **MuJoCo**, the citation is:
  > Tassa, Y., Doron, Y., Muldal, A., Erez, T., Li, Y., Casas, D. d. L., Budden, D., Abdolmaleki, A., Merel, J., Lefrancq, A., et al. (2018). DeepMind control suite. arXiv preprint arXiv:1801.00690.

Next, I will compile the information about the datasets into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for review or further processing, ensuring that all relevant details are captured accurately.
