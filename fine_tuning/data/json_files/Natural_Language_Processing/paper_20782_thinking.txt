To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ReMamber: Referring Image Segmentation with Mamba Twister" by Yuhuan Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors achieved state-of-the-art results on three challenging benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved. I will look for specific names of datasets in these sections.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets and Metrics)**, as this section is likely to provide detailed information about the datasets used in the experiments. Here, the authors explicitly mention three datasets:

1. **RefCOCO**: This dataset consists of 19,994 images and 142,210 referring expressions associated with 50,000 objects derived from the MSCOCO dataset. The dataset is split into training, validation, and test sets.

2. **RefCOCO+**: An enhanced version of RefCOCO, this dataset contains 141,564 expressions for 49,856 objects across 19,992 images, with a similar split as RefCOCO.

3. **G-Ref**: This dataset includes 104,560 referring expressions for 54,882 objects in 26,711 images, focusing on location and appearance descriptions.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **RefCOCO**, the citation is:
  > Kazemzadeh, S., Ordonez, V., Matten, M., & Berg, T. (2014). *ReferItGame: Referring to objects in photographs of natural scenes*. In Proceedings of the 2014 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP).

- For **RefCOCO+**, the citation is:
  > Yu, L., Lin, Z., Shen, X., Yang, J., Lu, X., Bansal, M., & Berg, T. (2018). *Mattnet: Modular attention network for referring expression comprehension*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR).

- For **G-Ref**, the citation is:
  > Mao, J., Huang, J., Toshev, A., Camburu, O.M., Yuille, A., & Murphy, K. (2015). *Generation and comprehension of unambiguous object descriptions*. In CVPR.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will allow for a clear and structured presentation of the datasets used in the research.
