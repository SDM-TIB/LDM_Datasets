To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Graph Exploration Matters: Improving both individual-level and system-level diversity in WeChat Feed Recommender" by Shuai Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the implementation and evaluation of a recommendation system, which suggests that datasets may be involved, particularly in the context of user engagement and system revenue.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. I will look for any specific mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics. In this paper, the authors mention conducting experiments on WeChat Top Stories, which implies that they may have used data from this platform.

I will also check the **related work section** for references to any datasets that might have been used in previous studies that the authors are building upon. This could provide additional context or datasets that are relevant to their work.

After identifying potential datasets, I will consult the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

If the paper does not explicitly mention datasets, I will note that as well, indicating that the authors may have used proprietary or internal datasets from WeChat, which are not publicly available.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. If no datasets are found, I will summarize the findings accordingly.

In summary, my steps will be:
1. Read the abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections for mentions of datasets.
2. Focus on the experiments section for specific dataset details.
3. Check the related work section for references to other datasets.
4. Consult the references section for full citations.
5. Compile the findings into a structured format, noting any proprietary datasets if applicable.
