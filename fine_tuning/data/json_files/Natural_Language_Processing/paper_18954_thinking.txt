To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Summing Up The Facts" by Bilal Chughtai et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus, and the introduction often outlines the datasets used for experiments.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss their investigation into factual recall mechanisms in large language models (LLMs). They mention that their dataset is inspired by previous works, specifically citing **CounterFact** and **ParaRel**. This indicates that there may be datasets related to factual recall tasks.

Next, I will look into the **methods section**, particularly the subsection titled **Dataset**. Here, the authors describe their dataset in detail. They mention that their dataset comprises **106 prompts across 10 different relations**. They also provide a table summarizing the relations studied, which includes examples of subjects and attributes.

The authors explicitly state that their dataset is manually generated and inspired by existing datasets, but they have specific requirements that led them to create their own. They also provide examples of factual tuples (s, r, a) along with sets S and R, which further clarifies the structure of their dataset.

Now, I will compile the relevant datasets mentioned in the paper:

1. **Custom Dataset for Factual Recall**: This dataset consists of 106 prompts across 10 different relations, specifically designed to test the factual recall capabilities of LLMs. The relations include "PLAYS SPORT," "IN COUNTRY," "CAPITAL CITY," and others, with examples provided in the paper.

2. **CounterFact Dataset**: This dataset is referenced as an inspiration for their own dataset. It is known for its focus on factual recall tasks in language models.
   - Citation: Meng, K., Bau, D., Andonian, A., & Belinkov, Y. (2023). *Locating and Editing Factual Associations in GPT*. arXiv:2202.05262.

3. **ParaRel Dataset**: Another dataset mentioned as an inspiration for their work, which deals with paraphrasing and factual recall.
   - Citation: Elazar, Y., Kassner, N., Ravfogel, S., Ravichander, A., Hovy, E., Sch√ºtze, H., & Goldberg, Y. (2021). *Measuring and Improving Consistency in Pretrained Language Models*. arXiv:2102.01017.

After gathering this information, I will ensure that I have the full citations for each dataset, as they are crucial for proper referencing. I will format these citations according to the appropriate academic style.

Finally, I will summarize the datasets in a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly identified along with its citation, ready for further processing or review.
