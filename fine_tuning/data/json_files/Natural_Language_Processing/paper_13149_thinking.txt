To extract datasets from the research paper titled "FairMonitor: A Four-Stage Automatic Framework for Detecting Stereotypes and Biases in Large Language Models" by Yanhong Bai et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the datasets discussed. The abstract mentions the construction of the **Edu-FairMonitor**, which consists of 12,632 open-ended questions covering various sensitive factors and educational scenarios. This indicates that a dataset is indeed present.

Next, I will look into the **methodology** and **dataset construction** sections to gather detailed information about the datasets. The paper describes the **Edu-FairMonitor** benchmark, which is specifically designed to evaluate stereotypes and biases in LLMs within the educational context. It encompasses 12,632 questions related to nine sensitive factors and 26 educational scenarios.

In the **appendix**, the authors provide a detailed breakdown of the sensitive factors and scenarios, which are crucial for understanding the dataset's structure. The sensitive factors include gender, race or cultural background, learning style, and others, while the scenarios relate to various educational contexts.

Now, I will compile the information about the dataset:

1. **Edu-FairMonitor**: This dataset consists of 12,632 open-ended questions designed to evaluate stereotypes and biases in LLMs, particularly in educational settings. It covers nine sensitive factors and 26 educational scenarios.

Next, I will locate the full citation for the **Edu-FairMonitor** dataset. Since the dataset is constructed as part of the research presented in this paper, I will cite the paper itself as the source of the dataset:

- For **Edu-FairMonitor**, the citation is:

After gathering all this information, I will prepare to format the dataset entry according to the specified requirements, ensuring that the citation is included for reference. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture the necessary details about the dataset from the research paper.
