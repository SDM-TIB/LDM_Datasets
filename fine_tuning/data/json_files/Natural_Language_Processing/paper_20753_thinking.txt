To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Uncertainty Propagation in Stochastic Systems via Mixture Models with Error Quantification" by Eduardo Figueiredo et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the effectiveness of the proposed framework on several benchmarks from the control community, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors describe the benchmarks used for evaluation. They mention four specific benchmarks:

1. **A 2-D linear system with bimodal initial distribution**: This system has dynamics defined by a specific matrix and noise distribution. The initial distribution is a mixture of two Gaussian distributions.

2. **A 2-D linear system with uniform noise and initial condition**: This system has similar dynamics to the previous one but uses a uniform distribution for noise and initial conditions.

3. **An unstable polynomial system**: The dynamics are defined by a polynomial function with Gaussian noise and a specific initial distribution.

4. **A 3D Dubins car model**: This model is described with specific parameters for velocity and noise distribution.

In the **references section**, I will look for full citations for these datasets. However, since these benchmarks are likely derived from existing literature or standard datasets in the field, I will need to identify the original sources for each benchmark mentioned.

For the **2-D linear systems**, I will check if they reference any foundational papers or datasets that describe similar systems. The **unstable polynomial system** and **3D Dubins car model** may also have standard references in control theory or robotics literature.

After gathering the necessary information, I will compile the full citations for each dataset used in the experiments. If the datasets are not explicitly cited in the paper, I will note that they are based on standard models commonly used in the literature.

Finally, I will summarize the findings, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation, ready for structured output or further processing.
