To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Deep Learning Method for Optimal Investment Under Relative Performance Criteria Among Heterogeneous Agents" by Mathieu Lauri√®re et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may indicate whether datasets are used for numerical experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (which may be labeled differently, such as "Results" or "Numerical Experiments") to find detailed descriptions of any datasets used. This section typically contains information about the datasets, including their names, sizes, and any specific characteristics relevant to the study.

I will also check the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

As I read through the paper, I will look for specific phrases that indicate the presence of datasets, such as "we used the following datasets," "the data was collected from," or "the experiments were conducted on." 

If the paper mentions any datasets, I will note down their names and any relevant details provided by the authors. For example, if the authors describe a dataset as containing a certain number of samples or specific features, I will record that information.

Once I have identified the datasets, I will compile the full citations for each dataset from the references section. This may involve looking up the original papers or sources if the datasets are not directly cited in the paper.

Finally, I will ensure that I have a clear and concise description of each dataset, including its name, purpose, and any relevant characteristics, along with the full citation for each dataset. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.

By following these steps, I will be able to extract and document the datasets effectively, ensuring that all necessary information is captured for future reference.
