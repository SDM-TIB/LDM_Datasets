To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Exposure Bracketing is All You Need for Unifying Image Restoration and Enhancement Tasks" by Zhilu Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any mention of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors constructed a data simulation pipeline and collected real-world images from 200 nighttime scenarios, suggesting that there are at least two datasets involved.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for further details. Here, the authors mention the challenges of capturing high-quality images in low-light conditions and the need for datasets to evaluate their proposed methods. This reinforces the idea that datasets are crucial to their work.

I will then focus on **section 4 (Datasets)**, which is likely to provide explicit details about the datasets used in their experiments. In this section, the authors describe two datasets:

1. **Synthetic Paired Dataset**: This dataset is constructed using HDR videos from Froehlich et al. (2014) to simulate multi-exposure images. The authors detail the process of creating this dataset, which includes frame interpolation and adding noise. They mention that they obtained 1,335 data pairs from 35 scenes, with 1,045 pairs for training and 290 pairs for testing.

2. **Real-World Dataset**: This dataset consists of real-world multi-exposure images collected using a Xiaomi 10S smartphone at night. The authors specify that they captured images from 200 nighttime scenarios, with 100 scenes used for training and 100 for evaluation.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

- For the **Synthetic Paired Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Froehlich, J., Grandinetti, S., Eberhardt, B., Walter, S., Schilling, A., Brendel, H. (2014). *Creating cinematic wide gamut hdr-video for the evaluation of tone mapping operators and hdr-displays*. In Digital Photography X.

- For the **Real-World Dataset**, the citation is:
  > ProShot (2023). *Proshot*. Retrieved from https://www.riseupgames.com/proshot.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their respective citations.
