To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "Development and external validation of a lung cancer risk estimation tool using gradient-boosting" by Pierre-Louis Benveniste et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study uses data from the **PLCO Cancer Screening Trial** and the **NLST**, which suggests that these datasets are central to the research.

Next, I will examine the **Methods** section, particularly **section 2 (Data used)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets. Here, they mention:

1. **PLCO Cancer Screening Trial**: This dataset is used for training the model and contains data from 154,887 patients with 219 features each. It focuses on evaluating cancer screening tests and includes comprehensive information on risk factors, clinical measurements, and outcomes.

2. **National Lung Screening Trial (NLST)**: This dataset serves as the external testing dataset and includes data from 48,595 patients. It aims to evaluate the efficacy of low-dose computed tomography in detecting lung cancer among high-risk individuals.

In the **Results** section, the authors confirm that the model was trained on the PLCO dataset and tested on the NLST dataset, reinforcing their importance in the study.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **PLCO Cancer Screening Trial**, the citation is:
  > Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial (PLCO). *https://prevention.cancer.gov/major-programs/prostate-lung-colorectal-and-ovarian-cancer-screening-trial-plco*. Accessed: 2023-6-20.

- For the **National Lung Screening Trial (NLST)**, the citation is:
  > National Lung Screening Trial Research Team et al. “The National Lung Screening Trial: overview and study design”. *Radiology 258.1 (Jan. 2011), pp. 243–253*.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **PLCO Cancer Screening Trial**: A comprehensive dataset used for training the model, containing data from 154,887 patients with 219 features related to lung cancer risk factors and outcomes.

2. **National Lung Screening Trial (NLST)**: An extensive dataset used for external validation, comprising data from 48,595 patients, focusing on the efficacy of low-dose computed tomography for lung cancer detection.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
