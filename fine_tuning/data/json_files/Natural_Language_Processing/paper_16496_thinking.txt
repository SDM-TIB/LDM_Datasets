To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Spectral and Polarization Vision: Spectro-polarimetric Real-world Dataset" by Yujin Jeon et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** sections to get an overview of the datasets introduced by the authors. The abstract mentions the introduction of two spectro-polarimetric datasets: **trichromatic Stokes images** and **hyperspectral Stokes images**. This indicates that these datasets are central to the research.

Next, I will look for detailed descriptions of these datasets in the **Methods** or **Datasets** section of the paper. In this case, the paper explicitly describes the datasets in the **"Spectro-polarimetric Dataset"** section. Here, the authors provide specific details about each dataset:

1. **Trichromatic Stokes Dataset**: This dataset consists of 2,022 Stokes images covering a variety of natural indoor and outdoor scenes. Each image is annotated with parameters such as the type of environment, illumination conditions, timestamp, and scene categorization.

2. **Hyperspectral Stokes Dataset**: This dataset contains 311 Stokes images across 21 spectral channels, also featuring diverse natural scenes. Similar to the trichromatic dataset, each image is annotated with the same parameters.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The paper does not provide separate citations for the datasets themselves, as they are original contributions of the authors. However, I will note that the datasets are described as being publicly available, which is important for future reference.

Now, I will compile the information about each dataset, ensuring to include the names, descriptions, and any relevant details that can be used for citation or further research.

Finally, I will summarize the findings in a structured format that highlights each dataset's key attributes, ensuring clarity and completeness for anyone reviewing the datasets extracted from this paper.
