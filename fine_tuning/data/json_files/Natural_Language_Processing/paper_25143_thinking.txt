To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An Economic Framework for 6-DoF Grasp Detection" by Xiao-Ming Wu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are referenced. The abstract mentions the use of **GraspNet-1Billion**, which is a strong indicator that this dataset is central to the research.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Dataset and Details)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the dataset used in their experiments. Here, they explicitly state that they use **GraspNet-1Billion** for training and evaluation. The section outlines the characteristics of this dataset, including the number of objects, scenes, and the nature of the data collected.

The authors describe **GraspNet-1Billion** as follows:
- It is a large-scale real-world dataset containing 88 objects and 190 scenes captured by two cameras (Kinect and RealScenes).
- The dataset reflects real-world grasp performance accurately and is the only dense real-world dataset available for analyzing the performance and costs of their framework.

Now, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citation for **GraspNet-1Billion**. The citation provided in the paper is:
> Fang, H.S., Wang, C., Gou, M., Lu, C. (2020). *GraspNet-1Billion: A large-scale benchmark for general object grasping*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 1-12.

With this information, I can summarize the dataset extraction as follows:

1. **GraspNet-1Billion**: A large-scale dataset for grasp detection, containing 88 objects and 190 scenes, captured using Kinect and RealScenes cameras. It is designed to reflect real-world grasp performance accurately.

Now, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This includes ensuring that the full citation is correctly formatted and attributed to the dataset mentioned in the paper.
