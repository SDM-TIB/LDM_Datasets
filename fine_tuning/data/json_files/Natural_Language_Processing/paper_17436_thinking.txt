To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Bridging Medical Jargon and Lay Understanding for Patient Education through Data-Centric NLP" by Zonghai Yao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates the introduction of a new dataset called **README**, which is a collection of medical terms and their lay definitions. This is a strong indication that I need to focus on this dataset.

Next, I will look into **section 4.1 (Dataset Construction)**, where the authors describe the README dataset in detail. They mention that it contains over **20,000 unique medical terms** and **300,000 mentions**, each with context-aware lay definitions. This section provides essential details about the dataset's composition and purpose.

In addition, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the README dataset. The authors do not provide a separate citation for the README dataset itself, as it is a novel dataset created for this study. However, they reference other works that contributed to the methodology and context of the dataset.

The README dataset is described as follows:
- **README Dataset**: An extensive collection of over 20,000 unique medical terms and 300,000 mentions, each offering context-aware lay definitions manually annotated by domain experts.

Since the README dataset is the primary dataset discussed in the paper, I will ensure to note its significance and the context in which it was created.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and any relevant citations or references that support its creation or methodology.

The final output will include:
- The dataset name: README Dataset
- A description of the dataset: A collection of over 20,000 unique medical terms and 300,000 mentions with lay definitions.
- Citation: Since the README dataset is novel and created by the authors, I will cite the paper itself as the source of the dataset.

The citation for the paper is:

With this information, I will prepare the dataset entry for further processing or review.
