To extract datasets from the research paper titled "FEED PETs: Further Experimentation and Expansion on the Disambiguation of Potentially Euphemistic Terms" by Patrick Lee et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to gather initial insights about the datasets. The abstract mentions the creation of novel euphemism corpora in three languages: **Yoruba, Spanish, and Mandarin Chinese**, which indicates that these are key datasets to focus on.

Next, I will examine **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used for their experiments. Here, I will find specific information about each dataset, including the number of examples, the types of examples (euphemistic vs. non-euphemistic), and the languages involved.

The datasets identified in this section are:

1. **American English Euphemism Dataset**: Contains 1952 examples, with 1383 euphemistic and 569 non-euphemistic examples, spanning 129 different potentially euphemistic terms (PETs).

2. **Mandarin Chinese Euphemism Dataset**: Comprises 1552 examples, with 1134 euphemistic and 418 non-euphemistic examples, covering 70 different PETs.

3. **Spanish Euphemism Dataset**: Includes 961 examples, with 564 euphemistic and 397 non-euphemistic examples, featuring 80 different PETs.

4. **Yoruba Euphemism Dataset**: Contains 1942 examples, with 1281 euphemistic and 661 non-euphemistic examples, spanning 129 different PETs.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The authors reference the original work by Gavidia et al. (2022) for the euphemism dataset, which is crucial for proper citation.

The citation for the euphemism dataset is:
- Gavidia, M., Lee, P., Feldman, A., & Peng, J. (2022). CATs are fuzzy PETs: A corpus and analysis of potentially euphemistic terms. In Proceedings of the Thirteenth Language Resources and Evaluation Conference, pages 2658â€“2671, Marseille, France. European Language Resources Association.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
