To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Invariant Kalman Filtering with Noise-Free Pseudo-Measurements" by Sven Goffin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections that discuss experiments or applications** to find any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's focus but may not explicitly mention datasets. Therefore, I will pay close attention to the introduction and subsequent sections.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the application of their method to various engineering tasks, including the estimation of the motion of a load on a crane and the pose estimation of a robotic arm. However, they do not mention specific datasets at this point.

Next, I will examine the **motivating problem section** and the **application examples**. Here, the authors describe two concrete applications: crane state estimation and robotic arm state estimation. They reference the use of IMUs (Inertial Measurement Units) but do not specify any datasets used for these applications.

I will then look for any **experimental results or evaluation sections** that might detail the datasets used to validate their proposed methods. However, it appears that the paper primarily discusses theoretical formulations and applications without providing specific datasets.

After thoroughly reviewing the paper, I will check the **References section** for any citations that might correspond to datasets. The references include various papers related to Kalman filtering and applications in robotics and control systems, but they do not explicitly mention datasets.

Since the paper does not provide specific datasets or their citations, I will conclude that there are no datasets to extract from this particular research paper. 

If there were datasets mentioned, I would ensure to document each dataset with its full citation, following the format used in the references section of the paper. This would involve identifying the authors, title, publication venue, and year for each dataset cited.

In summary, I will compile my findings and note that no specific datasets were identified in this paper, and therefore, no citations can be provided.
