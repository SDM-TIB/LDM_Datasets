To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Building Emotional Support Chatbots in the Era of LLMs" by Zhonghua Zheng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract indicates that the authors have created an extensive emotional support dialogue dataset, which suggests that there is a specific dataset to extract.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors discuss the challenges of data scarcity in emotional support conversations. They mention existing datasets like **ESConv** and **ETMHS**, which are relevant to the context of their work. I will note these datasets and look for further details.

In the **dataset collection section**, the authors describe their approach to constructing the ExTensible Emotional Support dialogue dataset (ExTES). They mention that they started with **87 seed dialogues** sourced from existing datasets, including **ESConv**, **ETMHS**, and **Reddit**. This section provides valuable information about the datasets used to create ExTES.

I will also check the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The citations for the datasets are crucial for proper attribution. 

1. **ESConv Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Siyang Liu, Chujie Zheng, Orianna Demasi, Sahand Sabour, Yu Li, Zhou Yu, Yong Jiang, and Minlie Huang. *Towards emotional support dialog systems*. In Proceedings of the 59th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics and the 11th International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing (Volume 1: Long Papers), pages 3469–3483, 2021.

2. **ETMHS Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Ashish Sharma, Adam Miner, David Atkins, and Tim Althoff. *A computational approach to understanding empathy expressed in text-based mental health support*. In Proceedings of the 2020 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), pages 5263–5276, 2020.

3. **Reddit Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Chun-Hung Yeh, Anuradha Welivita, and Pearl Pu Faltings. *A dialogue dataset containing emotional support for people in distress*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1503.08895, 2015.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets referenced in the paper, along with their proper attributions.
