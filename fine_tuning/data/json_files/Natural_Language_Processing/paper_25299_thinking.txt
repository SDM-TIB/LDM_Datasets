To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Large Language Model-based FMRI Encoding of Language Functions for Subjects with Neurocognitive Disorder" by Yuejiao Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on fMRI encoding models and their application to neurocognitive disorders, but it does not explicitly mention datasets.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any references to datasets. The introduction discusses the importance of detecting language-related functional changes in the brain but does not specify any datasets.

Moving on to the **data collection section**, I will find detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the study. Here, the authors describe two main tasks from which data was collected:

1. **Movie-watching fMRI task**: This dataset consists of fMRI data collected from 95 older adults while they watched an 11-minute clip from a Cantonese movie titled "Sweet Home." The dataset includes fMRI signals acquired during the task, with specific parameters for the MRI scanner and preprocessing steps.

2. **HK-MoCA test**: This dataset includes scores from the Hong Kong version of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (HK-MoCA), which was used to assess participants' cognitive function. The test scores range from 0 to 30, with higher scores indicating better cognitive states.

Next, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **HK-MoCA test**, the citation is:
  > Wong, A., Xiong, Y. Y., Kwan, P. W., Chan, A. Y., Lam, W. W., Wang, K., Chu, W. C., Nyenhuis, D. L., Nasreddine, Z., Wong, L. K. (2009). The validity, reliability and clinical utility of the Hong Kong Montreal Cognitive Assessment (HK-MoCA) in patients with cerebral small vessel disease. *Dementia and Geriatric Cognitive Disorders*, 28(1), 81-87.

- For the **movie-watching fMRI task**, while the paper does not provide a formal citation for the dataset, it is derived from the authors' own data collection efforts. Therefore, I will note it as an original dataset created for this study.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for the HK-MoCA test and a description for the movie-watching fMRI task dataset.

After completing this process, I will have a clear and structured representation of the datasets used in the study, ready for further processing or review.
