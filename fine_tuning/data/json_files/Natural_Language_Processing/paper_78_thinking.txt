To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Tips and Tricks for Visual Question Answering: Learnings from the 2017 Challenge" by Peter Anderson et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the paper presents a state-of-the-art model for visual question answering (VQA) and references the VQA v2 benchmark, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors discuss the importance of VQA and mention the VQA v2 dataset as a benchmark. They also refer to the Visual Genome dataset, indicating that both datasets are crucial for their experiments.

In the **background section**, the authors elaborate on the datasets used for VQA. They specifically mention the **VQA v2 dataset** and the **Visual Genome dataset**. The VQA v2 dataset is highlighted as the de facto benchmark for VQA since its introduction, and the Visual Genome dataset is described as containing annotations of images in the form of scene graphs, which are used to train their model.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **VQA v2 dataset**, the citation is:
   > Goyal, Y., Khot, T., Summers-Stay, D., Batra, D., & Parikh, D. (2016). Making the V in VQA matter: Elevating the role of image understanding in Visual Question Answering. *arXiv preprint arXiv:1612.00837*.

2. For the **Visual Genome dataset**, the citation is:
   > Krishna, R., Zhu, Y., Groth, O., Johnson, J., Hata, K., Kravitz, J., Chen, S., Kalantidis, Y., Li, L.-J., Shamma, D. A., Bernstein, M., & Fei-Fei, L. (2016). Visual genome: Connecting language and vision using crowdsourced dense image annotations. *arXiv preprint arXiv:1602.07332*.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets in a structured manner, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as they are critical for proper attribution and further research.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a clear format that can be used for review or further processing.
