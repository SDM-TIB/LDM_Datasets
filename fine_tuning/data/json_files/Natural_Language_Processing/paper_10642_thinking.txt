To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Debiasing Made State-of-the-art: Revisiting the Simple Seed-based Weak Supervision for Text Classification" by Chengyu Dong, Zihan Wang, and Jingbo Shang, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a general overview, but the introduction and experiments sections are likely to contain specific references to datasets used in the study.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss weakly supervised text classification and mention the use of seed words for generating pseudo-labels. However, they do not explicitly name any datasets here.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors detail their experimental setup. They mention several datasets used for text classification, specifically:

1. **20 Newsgroups (20News)**: A dataset commonly used for text classification tasks, consisting of approximately 20,000 newsgroup documents, partitioned across 20 different newsgroups.

2. **AGNews**: A dataset containing news articles categorized into four classes, with a total of 120,000 training samples.

3. **Rotten Tomatoes**: A dataset used for sentiment analysis, containing movie reviews labeled as positive or negative.

4. **New York Times (NYT)**: This dataset is mentioned in both coarse and fine-grained versions, indicating that it has multiple labeling schemes.

In **Table 1**, the authors provide statistics for these datasets, including the number of documents, labels, pseudo-labeled documents, noise rates, and sequence lengths. This table is crucial for understanding the datasets' characteristics.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. However, the paper does not provide specific citations for the datasets themselves, as they are well-known datasets in the field. Therefore, I will use the following standard citations for these datasets:

- **20 Newsgroups**:
  > Lang, K. (1995). *Newsweeder: Learning to filter netnews*. In Proceedings of the 1995 International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML), pages 331-338.

- **AGNews**:
  > Zhang, Y., Zhao, J., & LeCun, Y. (2015). *Character-level convolutional networks for text classification*. In Proceedings of the 28th International Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS), pages 649-657.

- **Rotten Tomatoes**:
  > Pang, B., & Lee, L. (2005). *Seeing stars: Exploiting class relationships for sentiment categorization with respect to rating scales*. In Proceedings of the ACL.

- **New York Times (NYT)**:
  > This dataset is often referenced in various works but does not have a single authoritative citation. It is commonly used in NLP research.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
