To extract datasets from the research paper titled "In-context Learning and Gradient Descent Revisited" by Gilad Deutch et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and the datasets section** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview, but the datasets section will likely contain the most detailed information.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the context of their research and mention that they build on the benchmark proposed by Dai et al. (2023). This indicates that the datasets used in their experiments are likely the same as those in Dai et al.'s work.

Next, I will focus on **section 2.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. They mention six datasets:

1. **SST2**: A dataset for sentiment classification.
2. **SST5**: Another sentiment classification dataset.
3. **MR**: A dataset for sentiment classification.
4. **Subj**: A dataset for sentiment classification.
5. **AGNews**: A topic classification dataset.
6. **CB**: A dataset used for natural language inference.

I will also check the **data statistics provided in Table 3** to gather additional details about each dataset, such as the number of training and validation samples.

Now, I will look up the full citations for each dataset in the **References section** of the paper. The citations are crucial for proper attribution. Based on the references provided in the paper, I can extract the following citations:

- For **SST2** and **SST5**, the citation is:
  > Richard Socher, Alex Perelygin, Jean Wu, Jason Chuang, Christopher D. Manning, Andrew Ng, and Christopher Potts. *Recursive deep models for semantic compositionality over a sentiment treebank*. In Proceedings of the 2013 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 1631–1642, Seattle, Washington, USA. Association for Computational Linguistics, 2013.

- For **MR**, the citation is:
  > Bo Pang and Lillian Lee. *Seeing stars: Exploiting class relationships for sentiment categorization with respect to rating scales*. In Proceedings of the 43rd Annual Meeting on Association for Computational Linguistics, ACL ’05, page 115–124, USA. Association for Computational Linguistics, 2005.

- For **Subj**, the citation is:
  > Bo Pang and Lillian Lee. *A sentimental education: Sentiment analysis using subjectivity summarization based on minimum cuts*. In Proceedings of the 42nd Annual Meeting on Association for Computational Linguistics, ACL ’04, page 271–es, USA. Association for Computational Linguistics, 2004.

- For **AGNews**, the citation is:
  > Xiang Zhang, Junbo Zhao, and Yann LeCun. *Character-level convolutional networks for text classification*. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, volume 28. Curran Associates, Inc., 2015.

- For **CB**, the citation is:
  > Marie-Catherine de Marneffe, Mandy Simons, and Judith Tonhauser. *The commitmentbank: Investigating projection in naturally occurring discourse*. In Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, pages 271–280, Florence, Italy. Association for Computational Linguistics, 2019.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and future reference. This will ensure that I have accurately captured all necessary details regarding the datasets used in the research.
