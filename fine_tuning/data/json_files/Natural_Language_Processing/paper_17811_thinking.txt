To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learn Once Plan Arbitrarily (LOPA): Attention-Enhanced Deep Reinforcement Learning Method for Global Path Planning" by Guoming Huang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the proposed method and its validation through experiments, which may hint at the datasets used.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section** to see if the authors reference any specific datasets or benchmarks that their method is evaluated against. This section often contains background information that may lead to the identification of relevant datasets.

In the **experiments section**, I will look for detailed descriptions of the datasets used for validation. The authors may describe the environments or simulations they created for testing the LOPA method. I will pay attention to any mention of specific datasets, including their characteristics, such as size, type, and purpose.

If the paper includes a **results section**, I will check for any tables or figures that summarize the performance of the LOPA method on different datasets. This may provide additional context about the datasets used and their significance in the experiments.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like "2.5D path planning simulation environment," I will look for the original source or any relevant publications that describe this dataset in detail. If the dataset is based on existing benchmarks, I will ensure to cite the original papers that introduced those benchmarks.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented and properly cited.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that all relevant details are included for each dataset identified in the paper.
