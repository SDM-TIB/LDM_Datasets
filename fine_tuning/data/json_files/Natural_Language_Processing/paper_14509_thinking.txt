To extract datasets from the research paper titled "STARS: Zero-shot Sim-to-Real Transfer for Segmentation of Shipwrecks in Sonar Imagery" by Advaith Venkatramanan Sethuraman and Katherine A. Skinner, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method on a real, expert-labeled side scan sonar dataset of shipwrecks, which suggests that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they describe the real dataset collected from Thunder Bay National Marine Sanctuary (TBNMS) and the simulated dataset they generated.

1. **TBNMS Dataset**: The authors mention that this dataset consists of 220 scans of terrain and shipwrecks collected with an AUV in Thunder Bay National Marine Sanctuary. They specify that the dataset includes 861 images, with 312 images of terrain and 549 images of shipwrecks, which were labeled by an expert marine archaeologist.

2. **Synthetic Dataset**: The authors also created a synthetic dataset consisting of 10,000 images generated using their simulation process. This dataset is used for training and validation, with an 80/20 split.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. However, since the TBNMS dataset is a unique dataset collected by the authors, it may not have a formal citation in the references. Instead, I will note that the dataset is described in the paper itself.

For the synthetic dataset, since it is generated by the authors using their own methods, it also does not have a separate citation. However, I will note the method used for its generation as described in the paper.

In summary, I will compile the dataset entries as follows:

- For the **TBNMS Dataset**, I will note the details provided in the paper, including the number of scans and images, and mention that it is labeled by an expert.
- For the **Synthetic Dataset**, I will summarize the generation process and the number of images created.

Finally, I will ensure that I have accurately captured the essence of each dataset and its significance in the context of the research presented in the paper.
