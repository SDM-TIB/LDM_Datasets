To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MOSE: Boosting Vision-based Roadside 3D Object Detection with Scene Cues" by Xiahan Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. In the abstract, the authors mention that their method demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on two public benchmarks. This indicates that datasets are involved, and I need to identify them.

Next, I will look closely at the **experiments section** (Section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In **Section 4.1 (Dataset)**, they explicitly mention two datasets:

1. **DAIR-V2X**: This is described as a large-scale and multi-modality vehicle-infrastructure collaborative 3D detection dataset, focusing on the roadside perception subset named DAIR-V2X-I, which includes 10,084 images. The dataset is split into training, validation, and testing sets.

2. **Rope3D**: This dataset consists of over 50,000 image frames captured in various scenes under different weather conditions and densities. The authors mention that they split 70% of the images for training and the remaining 30% for validation.

To confirm the details of these datasets, I will check the **references section** of the paper for full citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **DAIR-V2X**, the citation is:
  > Haibao Yu, Yizhen Luo, Mao Shu, Yiyi Huo, Zebang Yang, Yifeng Shi, Zhenglong Guo, Hanyu Li, Xing Hu, Jirui Yuan, and Zaiqing Nie. *DAIR-V2X: A large-scale dataset for vehicle-infrastructure cooperative 3D object detection*. In IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 21329–21338, 2022.

- For **Rope3D**, the citation is:
  > Xiaoqing Ye, Mao Shu, Hanyu Li, Yifeng Shi, Yingying Li, Guangjie Wang, Xiao Tan, and Errui Ding. *Rope3D: The roadside perception dataset for autonomous driving and monocular 3D object detection task*. In IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 21309–21318, 2022.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will summarize the findings in a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
