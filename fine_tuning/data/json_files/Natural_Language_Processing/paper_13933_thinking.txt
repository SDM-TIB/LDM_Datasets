To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Interactively Teaching an Inverse Reinforcement Learner with Limited Feedback" by Rustam Zayanova et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper, as these sections typically provide insights into the datasets used for the research. The abstract mentions testing the algorithm in a **synthetic car driving environment**, which suggests that this environment may serve as a dataset or a simulation framework.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this case, the authors describe the **synthetic car driving environment** in detail, outlining its structure, types of roads, and the features associated with each state. This indicates that the environment itself is a dataset used for the experiments.

I will summarize the key points regarding the dataset:

1. **Synthetic Car Driving Environment**: This dataset consists of 40 isolated roads, each with different driving conditions (T0 to T7). The environment is represented as a 2 Ã— 10 grid, and the agent's actions are defined within this context. The dataset includes features such as the presence of stones, grass, cars, pedestrians, and HOV lanes.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find any citations related to the datasets. However, since the synthetic environment is a novel creation by the authors, it may not have a formal citation like established datasets. Instead, I will note that the dataset is described in the paper itself.

The relevant citation for the paper is:
> Rustam Zayanova, Francisco S. Melo, and Manuel Lopes. *Interactively Teaching an Inverse Reinforcement Learner with Limited Feedback*. In Proceedings of the Conference on Robot Learning, (2023).

Since the synthetic car driving environment is the primary dataset discussed, I will document it accordingly, ensuring to include the full citation of the paper.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format for clarity and future reference.
