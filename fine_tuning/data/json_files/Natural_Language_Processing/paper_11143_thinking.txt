To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Exposing Bias in Online Communities through Large-Scale Language Models" by Celine Wald and Lukas Pfahler, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and often mentions key datasets. In this case, the authors indicate that they fine-tuned a language model using six social media datasets, which suggests that these datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, specifically section 3, where the authors describe their approach to examining bias in online communities. Here, they explicitly list the datasets used for fine-tuning the language model. The datasets mentioned include:

1. **Reddit WallStreetBets**: This dataset comprises all posts and comments from the WallStreetBets subreddit from December 6, 2020, to February 6, 2021. It focuses on discussions about stock and option trading.

2. **Reddit Cryptocurrency**: This dataset includes posts and comments from various cryptocurrency-related subreddits, such as r/CryptoCurrency and r/CryptoMoonShots, collected in August 2021.

3. **Reddit COVID**: This dataset is a collection of all posts and comments mentioning COVID-19 across various subreddits, reflecting general trends in discussions about the pandemic.

4. **Reddit /r/NoNewNormal**: This dataset consists of all posts and comments from the NoNewNormal subreddit, which was dedicated to discussions against COVID-19 measures and has since been banned.

5. **Ummah**: This dataset includes all posts and comments from a Muslim online community forum, providing insights into discussions within that community.

6. **ChristianChat**: This dataset comprises all posts and comments from a Christian online community, allowing for the examination of biases in religious discussions.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

Now that I have gathered the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their proper citations for future reference.
