To extract datasets from the research paper titled "VisualWebArena: Agents on Realistic Visual Web Tasks" by Jing Yu Koh et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract introduces **VisualWebArena** as a benchmark for multimodal web agents, which suggests that there may be datasets associated with this benchmark.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Curating Visually Grounded Tasks)**, where the authors detail the environments and tasks included in VisualWebArena. Here, they mention that the benchmark consists of **910 tasks across three environments: Classifieds, Shopping, and Reddit**. This indicates that there are datasets related to these environments.

In **subsection 4.1 (Web Environments)**, the authors describe the datasets used for each environment:

1. **Classifieds Dataset**: This dataset contains **65,955 listings** scraped from real-world classifieds websites, specifically focusing on the Northeastern States of the US. Each listing includes a title, description, and product image.

2. **Shopping Dataset**: This dataset is derived from the **WebArena** framework and includes product information scraped from **Amazon**, which is used for e-commerce tasks.

3. **Reddit Dataset**: This dataset consists of **31,464 posts** from various subreddits, featuring a diverse set of images and text content.

I will also check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. However, since the datasets are primarily described in terms of their content and sources rather than being formal datasets with specific citations, I will summarize the information based on the descriptions provided in the paper.

The citations for the environments are as follows:

- For the **Classifieds Dataset**:
  > Koh, J. Y., Lo, R., Jang, L., Duvvur, V., Lim, M. C., Huang, P. Y., Neubig, G., Salakhutdinov, R., & Fried, D. (2024). VisualWebArena: Agents on Realistic Visual Web Tasks. *Preprint*.

- For the **Shopping Dataset**:
  > Zhou, S., Xu, F. F., Zhu, H., Zhou, X., Lo, R., Sridhar, A., Cheng, X., Bisk, Y., Fried, D., Alon, U., et al. (2024). WebArena: A Realistic Web Environment for Building Autonomous Agents. *ICLR*.

- For the **Reddit Dataset**:
  > Koh, J. Y., Lo, R., Jang, L., Duvvur, V., Lim, M. C., Huang, P. Y., Neubig, G., Salakhutdinov, R., & Fried, D. (2024). VisualWebArena: Agents on Realistic Visual Web Tasks. *Preprint*.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries based on the information extracted, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets associated with the VisualWebArena benchmark.
