To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Time to Stop and Think: What Kind of Research Do We Want to Do?" by Josu Ceberio and Borja Calvo, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and main body of the paper** to look for any references to datasets. The abstract provides a general overview, but I need to focus on sections that might explicitly mention datasets or benchmarks used in their research.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss their concerns about the rigor of experimentation in metaheuristic optimization but do not mention specific datasets. I will continue to the **main body** of the paper, particularly sections that discuss experimentation and methodology.

As I read through the paper, I will pay close attention to any mention of datasets, benchmarks, or empirical data used to support their arguments. However, it appears that the authors are more focused on the philosophical aspects of research methodology rather than presenting specific datasets.

Next, I will check the **References section** to see if any datasets are cited indirectly through the works of others. The references may include studies that utilized specific datasets, which could be relevant to the authors' arguments about experimentation.

Upon reviewing the references, I find several citations, but none of them explicitly mention datasets used in their own research. The references primarily discuss broader issues in research methodology and do not provide specific datasets.

Since the paper does not present any datasets directly, I will conclude that there are no datasets to extract from this particular paper. Therefore, I will not be able to provide full citations for datasets as none are mentioned.

In summary, I will document that the paper does not include specific datasets, and I will note that the focus is on the critique of research practices in metaheuristic optimization rather than empirical data collection or experimentation.
