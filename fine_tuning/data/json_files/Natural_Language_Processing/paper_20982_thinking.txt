To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Advancing the Arabic WordNet: Elevating Content Quality" by Abed Alhakim Freihat et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract highlights the introduction of AWN V3, which suggests that there may be datasets related to the Arabic WordNet.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly the parts that describe the data collection and enhancement processes. Here, the authors mention that they prepared a dataset containing AWN V1 synsets and their corresponding PWN synsets. This indicates that there is a dataset related to the synsets of the Arabic WordNet.

In the **evaluation section**, the authors provide details about the experiments conducted on different parts of speech (POS) and the number of synsets involved. They mention that the dataset includes 6,516 nouns, 2,507 verbs, 446 adjectives, and 107 adverbs, which gives a clear indication of the dataset's structure and content.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper references several works that are foundational to the Arabic WordNet, including:

1. **AWN V1**: 
   > Sabri Elkateb, William Black, Horacio Rodríguez, Musa Alkhalifa, Piek Vossen, Adam Pease, and Christiane Fellbaum. *Building a WordNet for Arabic*. In Proceedings of the Fifth International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC’06), pages 29–34, 2006.

2. **PWN (Princeton WordNet)**:
   > George A. Miller. *WordNet: A lexical database for English*. Communications of the ACM, 38(11):39–41, 1995.

3. **AWN V2**:
   > Yasser Regragui, Lahsen Abouenour, Fettoum Krieche, Karim Bouzoubaa, and Paolo Rosso. *Arabic Wordnet: New content and new applications*. In Proceedings of the 8th Global WordNet Conference (GWC), pages 333–341, 2016.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets referenced in the paper, ready for further processing or review.
