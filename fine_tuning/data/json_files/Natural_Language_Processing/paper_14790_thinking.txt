To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ROMO: Retrieval-enhanced Offline Model-based Optimization" by Mingcheng Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions experiments conducted on a **synthetic Hartmann (3D) function dataset**, an **industrial CIO dataset**, and a **suite of modified tasks in the Design-Bench benchmark**. This indicates that there are at least three datasets to extract.

Next, I will look for specific details about each dataset in the **experiments section**. In this section, the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments:

1. **Hartmann (3D) Function Dataset**: The paper provides a detailed description of the Hartmann function, which is used as a benchmark for optimization problems. It mentions that the function has multiple local maxima and one global maximum, and it specifies how the dataset is constructed.

2. **CIO Load Balancing Dataset**: This dataset consists of 138 continuous features, with 36 dimensions representing the adjustable CIO parameters. The authors describe how they preprocess the dataset by removing the top and bottom samples based on function values.

3. **Design-Bench Dataset**: The paper discusses the Design-Bench benchmark, specifically mentioning the Hopper Controller and TF Bind 8 tasks. It notes that the dataset is not originally designed for the CoMBO scenario but provides experimental results based on it.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **Hartmann (3D) function**, the citation is:
  > A. G. Schaffer, "Some Experiments in Machine Learning Using Vector Evaluated Genetic Algorithms," in Proceedings of the 1st International Conference on Genetic Algorithms, 1985, pp. 93-100.

- For the **CIO Load Balancing dataset**, the citation is:
  > H. Zhao et al., "CIO Load Balancing: A Real-World Application of Model-Based Optimization," in Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Communications, 2022.

- For the **Design-Bench benchmark**, the citation is:
  > B. Trabucco et al., "Design-Bench: Benchmarks for Data-Driven Offline Model-Based Optimization," in International Conference on Machine Learning, ICML 2022, pp. 21658-21676.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and includes its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
