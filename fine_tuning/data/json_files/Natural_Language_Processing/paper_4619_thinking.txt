To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Partition Filter Network for Joint Entity and Relation Extraction" by Zhiheng Yan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on **six public datasets**, which indicates that multiple datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section (Section 5)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for evaluation. They mention the following datasets:

1. **NYT**: This dataset is sampled from New York Times news articles and annotated by distant supervision. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Riedel, S., Yao, L., & McCallum, A. (2010). Modeling relations and their mentions without labeled text. In Joint European Conference on Machine Learning and Knowledge Discovery in Databases (pp. 148-163). Springer.

2. **WebNLG**: Originally created for Natural Language Generation tasks, this dataset has been applied for relation extraction. The citation is:
   > Zeng, Z., Liu, K., Lai, S., Zhou, G., & Zhao, J. (2018). Extracting relational facts by an end-to-end neural model with copy mechanism. In Proceedings of the 56th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers) (pp. 506-514). Association for Computational Linguistics.

3. **ADE**: This dataset contains medical descriptions of adverse effects of drug use. The citation is:
   > Gurulingappa, H., Rajput, A. M., Roberts, A., Fluck, J., Hofmann-Apitius, M., & Toldo, L. (2012). Development of a benchmark corpus to support the automatic extraction of drug-related adverse effects from medical case reports. Journal of Biomedical Informatics, 45(5), 885-892.

4. **ACE05**: Collected from various sources, including news articles and online forums. The citation is:
   > Walker, C., Strassel, S., Medero, J., & Maeda, K. (2006). ACE 2005 multilingual training corpus. Linguistic Data Consortium, Philadelphia.

5. **ACE04**: Similar to ACE05, this dataset is also collected from various sources. The citation is:
   > Walker, C., Strassel, S., Medero, J., & Maeda, K. (2006). ACE 2005 multilingual training corpus. Linguistic Data Consortium, Philadelphia.

6. **SciERC**: This dataset is collected from AI paper abstracts originally used for scientific knowledge graph construction. The citation is:
   > Luan, Y., He, L., Ostendorf, M., & Hajishirzi, H. (2018). Multi-task identification of entities, relations, and coreference for scientific knowledge graph construction. In Proceedings of the 2018 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (pp. 3219-3232). Association for Computational Linguistics.

After identifying the datasets and their citations, I will ensure that I have accurately captured the details and citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference and further processing.
