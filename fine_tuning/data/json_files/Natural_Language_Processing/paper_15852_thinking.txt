To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Enhancing Computation Efficiency in Large Language Models through Weight and Activation Quantization" by Janghwan Lee et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract discusses the evaluation of techniques on various benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved. I will look for specific names of datasets or benchmarks mentioned in these sections.

Next, I will carefully read through the **background** and **experimental results** sections, as these often contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used for evaluation. I will pay particular attention to any tables or figures that might summarize the datasets or their characteristics.

In the **experimental results** section, the authors mention evaluating their methods on several benchmarks, including **Wikitext**, **Common Sense Question Answering (CSQA)**, and **Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU)**. I will note these benchmarks as they likely correspond to specific datasets.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for the datasets used in the research.

For the datasets identified:
1. **Wikitext**: This dataset is commonly used for language modeling tasks. The citation for Wikitext is:
   > Stephen Merity, Caiming Xiong, James Bradbury, and Richard Socher. *Pointer Sentinel Mixture Models*. In Proceedings of the 33rd International Conference on Machine Learning, 2016.

2. **Common Sense Question Answering (CSQA)**: This dataset is used for evaluating reasoning capabilities in language models. The citation for CSQA is:
   > Yonatan Bisk, Rowan Zellers, Ronan Le Bras, Jianfeng Gao, and Yejin Choi. *Piqa: Reasoning about physical commonsense in natural language*. In Proceedings of the 2019 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, 2019.

3. **Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU)**: This benchmark is used for evaluating the performance of language models across various tasks. The citation for MMLU is:
   > Dan Hendrycks, Collin Burns, Steven Basart, Andy Zou, Mantas Mazeika, Dawn Song, and Jacob Steinhardt. *Measuring massive multitask language understanding*. In Proceedings of the 2021 Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems, 2021.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that all relevant details are captured and properly attributed.
