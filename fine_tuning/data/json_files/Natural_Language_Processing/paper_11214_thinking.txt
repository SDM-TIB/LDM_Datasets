To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-Task Training with In-Domain Language Models for Diagnostic Reasoning" by Brihat Sharma et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the introduction of the **Diagnostic Reasoning Benchmark (DR.BENCH)**, which suggests that this is a key dataset used in the research.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, specifically **section 3 (Methods)**, where the authors describe the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they explicitly mention the **DR.BENCH** benchmark and detail its components, which include various tasks related to clinical reasoning.

In **subsection 3.1 (Dataset)**, the authors outline the specific tasks included in DR.BENCH:

1. **Medical Natural Language Inference (MedNLI)**: This task consists of 14,049 sentence pairs aimed at determining inference relationships.
2. **Assessment and Plan Reasoning (A/P)**: This task includes 5,897 samples that label relations between assessment and treatment plans.
3. **Electronic Medical Records Question Answering (emrQA)**: This task has 53,199 questions based on discharge summaries.
4. **Progress Note Section Labeling**: This task involves 134,089 samples for labeling SOAP sections in progress notes.
5. **Medical Board Exam Question Answering (MedQA)**: This dataset consists of 12,725 question-answer pairs from medical board exams.
6. **Problem Summarization (ProbSumm)**: This task includes 2,783 samples aimed at generating relevant problems and diagnoses from SOAP sections.

I will also check the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The authors cite the following key references related to the datasets:

- For **DR.BENCH**, the citation is:

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
