To extract datasets from the research paper titled "From Interactive to Co-Constructive Task Learning" by Anna-Lisa Vollmer et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract typically provides a concise overview of the research, which may include references to datasets used for experiments or evaluations.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors often discuss the context of their research and may mention specific datasets that are relevant to their work. I will look for any phrases that indicate the use of datasets, such as "we evaluated our approach on..." or "the following datasets were used...".

Then, I will examine the **related work** and **methodology sections** for any detailed descriptions of datasets. These sections often provide insights into how previous studies have utilized datasets, which may lead to the identification of datasets that the current research builds upon or compares against.

If the paper includes a **results or experiments section**, I will pay close attention to this part as it often contains explicit mentions of datasets used for testing the proposed methods. The authors may provide specific details about the datasets, such as their size, characteristics, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

For example, if the authors mention using a dataset like the "XYZ Dataset" for their experiments, I will look for the corresponding citation in the references, which might look something like this:
> Author(s). *Title of the Dataset Paper*. In Proceedings of the Conference, Year.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset information in a structured format that can be easily reviewed or processed further, ensuring that all citations are complete and accurate.
