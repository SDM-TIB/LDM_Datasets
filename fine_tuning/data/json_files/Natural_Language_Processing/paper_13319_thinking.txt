To extract datasets from the research paper titled "PFL-GAN: When Client Heterogeneity Meets Generative Models in Personalized Federated Learning" by Achintha Wijesinghe et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the empirical results are based on "several well-known datasets," which indicates that datasets are indeed used in the research.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section (Section 4)**, where the authors describe their experimental setup. They mention three scenarios, each involving different datasets:

1. **MNIST Dataset**: Used in Scenario-1 for evaluating the performance of the proposed method under label skewness. The authors specify that each client has a private dataset consisting of all 10 MNIST classes with a certain distribution of samples.

2. **FMNIST Dataset**: This dataset is used in Scenario-2, where half of the clients represent the MNIST dataset and the other half represent the FMNIST dataset. The authors provide details on how the sample distribution is set up for these clients.

3. **EMNIST Dataset**: In Scenario-3, the authors mention using the EMNIST dataset, which includes capital and simple letters. They describe how clients are assigned to different feature spaces based on this dataset.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

- For the **MNIST Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Deng, L. (2012). The MNIST database of handwritten digit images for machine learning research. *IEEE Signal Processing Magazine*, 29(6), 141-142.

- For the **FMNIST Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Xiao, H., Rasul, K., & Vollgraf, R. (2017). Fashion-MNIST: A novel image dataset for benchmarking machine learning algorithms. *CoRR*, abs/1708.07747.

- For the **EMNIST Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Cohen, G., Afshar, S., Tapson, J., & van Schaik, A. (2017). EMNIST: An extension of MNIST to handwritten letters.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
