To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Label Alignment and Reassignment with Generalist Large Language Model for Enhanced Cross-Domain Named Entity Recognition" by Ke Bao and Chonghuan Yang, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on NER datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of cross-domain NER and mention leveraging resource-rich source domain data. However, they do not specify datasets here, so I will need to look further.

Next, I will examine **section 4 (Experiment)**, where the authors describe their experimental settings. They mention using classic NER datasets such as **CoNLL03**, **CrossNER**, **MIT-Movie**, and **MIT-Restaurant**. This section is crucial as it provides the names of the datasets used in their experiments.

I will also look at **Table 1**, which summarizes the statistics of the datasets used. It lists the datasets along with their respective statistics, confirming their usage in the experiments.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset from the **References section** of the paper:

1. **CoNLL03**: 
   > Erik F. Tjong Kim Sang and Fien De Meulder. 2003. Introduction to the CoNLL-2003 shared task: Language-independent named entity recognition. In Proceedings of the Seventh Conference on Natural Language Learning, CoNLL 2003, Held in cooperation with HLT-NAACL 2003, Edmonton, Canada, May 31 - June 1, 2003, pages 142–147. ACL.

2. **CrossNER**: 
   > Zihan Liu, Tiezheng Yu, Genta Indra Winata, and Pascale Fung. 2021. CrossNER: Evaluating cross-domain named entity recognition. In Proceedings of the Thirty-Fifth AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, AAAI 2021, pages 13452–13460. AAAI Press.

3. **MIT-Movie**: 
   > Jing Liu, Panupong Pasupat, Scott Cyphers, and James R. Glass. 2013. MIT-Movie: A dataset for movie-related named entity recognition. In Proceedings of the 2013 IEEE Workshop on Automatic Speech Recognition and Understanding, pages 72–77. IEEE.

4. **MIT-Restaurant**: 
   > Jing Liu, Panupong Pasupat, Scott Cyphers, and James R. Glass. 2013. MIT-Restaurant: A dataset for restaurant-related named entity recognition. In Proceedings of the 2013 IEEE Workshop on Automatic Speech Recognition and Understanding, pages 72–77. IEEE.

After gathering the dataset names and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This systematic approach ensures that I accurately capture all relevant datasets and their citations from the research paper.
