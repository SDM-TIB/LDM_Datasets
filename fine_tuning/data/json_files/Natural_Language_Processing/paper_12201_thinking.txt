To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Generalizable Classification of UHF Partial Discharge Signals in Gas-Insulated HVDC Systems Using Neural Networks" by Steffen Seitz et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the classification of partial discharge (PD) signals, which suggests that there may be datasets related to these signals.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental setup and methods section**. Here, the authors describe the measurements taken and the conditions under which they were collected. They mention that the study is based on UHF DC-PD signals measured under DC voltage stress, and they refer to a dataset containing a total of 33,000 individual PD measurements taken at different multiples of the inception voltage (Ui). This indicates that there is a significant dataset involved.

In **Table I**, the authors provide a summary of the number of available measurements for each source class, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's structure. The classes include measurements for different defect types and polarities, such as particles on the insulator and protrusions, categorized by their respective multiples of Ui.

I will also check the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets or related works mentioned. The authors reference a dissertation by T. Götz, which likely contains relevant information about the dataset used in this study.

The relevant datasets extracted from the paper are:

1. **UHF DC-PD Signals Dataset**: This dataset consists of 33,000 individual PD measurements taken at various multiples of the inception voltage (Ui). The measurements are categorized based on defect types (particles and protrusions) and their polarities (negative and positive).

2. **Source Class Measurements**: The dataset includes measurements for different source classes, as summarized in Table I, which provides the number of measurements for each class based on the defect type and polarity.

Now, I will compile the full citations for the datasets:

- For the **UHF DC-PD Signals Dataset**, the citation is:
  > T. Götz, “Partial discharge behaviour of gas-solid insulation systems under DC voltage stress,” Dissertation, Technical University Dresden, 2022.

- For the **source class measurements**, since they are part of the same dataset, I will use the same citation as above.

After gathering this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for further processing, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited.
