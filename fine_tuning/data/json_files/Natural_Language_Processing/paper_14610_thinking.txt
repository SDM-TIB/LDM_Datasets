To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SPECTRO-SPATIAL HYPERSPECTRAL IMAGE RECONSTRUCTION FROM INTERFEROMETRIC ACQUISITIONS" by Daniele Picone et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, experiments, and results sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract provides a general overview of the study but may not explicitly mention datasets. Therefore, I will focus on the introduction and methodology sections, where the authors often describe the data used for their experiments.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of hyperspectral imaging and the need for training data, indicating that they may have used specific datasets for their experiments. However, they do not explicitly name any datasets in this section.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** closely. Here, the authors describe their experimental setup, including the use of a hyperspectral camera, the generation of a reference dataset, and the parameters used for their simulations. They mention that they acquired a hyperspectral image (HSI) with the commercial hyperspectral camera Specim IQ, which serves as the basis for their experiments. This indicates that the Specim IQ dataset is relevant.

The authors also mention that they generated a reference dataset by spatially resizing the raw acquisition to 96 × 96 pixels and interpolating the channels to sample the range of visible wavenumbers. This reference dataset is crucial for their analysis and comparison of reconstruction methods.

Now, I will look into the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The authors refer to previous works and methodologies that may provide context for the datasets used. However, they do not provide specific citations for the datasets themselves, as they primarily focus on the methods and algorithms.

Based on my findings, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **Specim IQ Hyperspectral Camera Dataset**: This dataset is acquired using the Specim IQ hyperspectral camera, which captures a scene containing a color checker and geometrical targets. The authors do not provide a formal citation for this dataset, but it is essential for their experiments.

2. **Generated Reference Dataset**: This dataset is created by resizing the raw acquisition to 96 × 96 pixels and interpolating the channels to sample the visible wavenumber range. Again, no formal citation is provided, but it is critical for the evaluation of their reconstruction methods.

Since the authors do not provide formal citations for the datasets, I will note that the Specim IQ camera is a commercial product and can be referenced as follows:

- **Specim IQ Hyperspectral Camera**: Specim, Spectral Imaging Ltd. *Specim IQ Hyperspectral Camera*. [Online]. Available: https://www.specim.fi/products/specim-iq/

Now, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
