To extract datasets from the research paper titled "BPE-Dropout: Simple and Effective Subword Regularization" by Ivan Provilkov et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the datasets used.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experimental setup)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used in their experiments. In this section, they mention several datasets and provide details about them, including the number of sentences, vocabulary sizes, and language pairs. 

I will specifically look for a **table summarizing the datasets** (Table 1 in this case), which lists the datasets along with their characteristics. The datasets mentioned include:

1. **IWSLT15**: English ↔ Vietnamese and English ↔ Chinese datasets with specific sentence counts and vocabulary sizes.
2. **IWSLT17**: English ↔ French and English ↔ Arabic datasets, also with detailed statistics.
3. **WMT14**: English ↔ German dataset with a large number of sentences.
4. **ASPEC**: English ↔ Japanese dataset.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

For example, the citation for the **IWSLT datasets** might be found in the references as:
> Cettolo, M., Girardi, C., & Federico, M. (2012). *WIT3: Web Inventory of Transcribed and Translated Talks*. In Proceedings of the Eighth International Workshop on Spoken Language Translation.

Similarly, I will look for citations for the **WMT14 dataset** and **ASPEC dataset**. 

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for easy reference and further processing.
