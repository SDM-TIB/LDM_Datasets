To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Enhancing Airline Customer Satisfaction: A Machine Learning and Causal Analysis Approach" by Tejas Mirthipati, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract, introduction, and data collection sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of machine learning and causal inference methods, which suggests that data is involved. The introduction provides context about the airline industry and customer satisfaction, but I need to look for specific datasets.

In **section II (Data Collection and Preprocessing)**, the author explicitly mentions a dataset titled **“Airline Passenger Satisfaction,”** which is sourced from Kaggle. This is a clear indication of a dataset being used in the study. The section provides details about the dataset, including its size (over 100,000 observations, approximately 15 MB) and the nature of the data (22 predictors of customer satisfaction).

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset mentioned. The reference for the **Airline Passenger Satisfaction** dataset is:

- **Airline Passenger Satisfaction Dataset**: 
  > T. J. Mahal, “Airline Passenger Satisfaction,” Kaggle, 2020. [Online]. Available: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/teejmahal20/airline-passenger-satisfaction

Since this is the only dataset explicitly mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information into a structured format.

Now, I will summarize the dataset details, including its name, description, and citation, ensuring that the citation is complete and accurate. This will allow for proper referencing in any subsequent analysis or reporting.

After gathering all necessary information, I will prepare the dataset entry for review or further processing.
