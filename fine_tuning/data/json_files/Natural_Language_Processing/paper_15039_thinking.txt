To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DialogueLLM: Context and Emotion Knowledge-Tuned Large Language Models for Emotion Recognition in Conversations" by Yazhou Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their model on three benchmarking emotion recognition in conversations (ERC) datasets. This suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will look into **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they explicitly mention three datasets:

1. **MELD**: This dataset consists of 13,708 multi-modal utterances from 1,433 multi-party dialogues of the Friends TV series. Each utterance is annotated with one of three sentiments (positive, negative, or neutral) and one of seven emotions (anger, disgust, fear, joy, neutral, sadness, or surprise).

2. **IEMOCAP**: This dataset includes 151 recorded dialogue videos, comprising a total of 302 videos across five sessions. Each session features two speakers, and the utterances are annotated with nine distinct emotions (anger, excitement, fear, sadness, surprise, frustration, happiness, disappointment, and neutrality).

3. **EmoryNLP**: This dataset consists of 97 episodes, 897 scenes, and 12,606 utterances, which are transcripts of multi-party dialogues from the Friends TV show. Each utterance is annotated with one of seven emotions (sad, mad, scared, powerful, peaceful, joyful, and neutral).

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and further exploration by other researchers.

The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **MELD**, the citation is:
  > Soujanya Poria, Devamanyu Hazarika, Navonil Majumder, Gautam Naik, Erik Cambria, and Rada Mihalcea. *MELD: A Multimodal Multi-Party Dataset for Emotion Recognition in Conversations*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1810.02508, 2018.

- For **IEMOCAP**, the citation is:
  > Carlos Busso, Murtaza Bulut, Chi-Chun Lee, Abe Kazemzadeh, Emily Mower, Samuel Kim, Jeannette N Chang, Sungbok Lee, and Shrikanth S Narayanan. *IEMOCAP: Interactive Emotional Dyadic Motion Capture Database*. Language Resources and Evaluation, 42:335â€“359, 2008.

- For **EmoryNLP**, the citation is:
  > Sayyed M Zahiri and Jinho D Choi. *Emotion Detection on TV Show Transcripts with Sequence-Based Convolutional Neural Networks*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1708.04299, 2017.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference and further use.
