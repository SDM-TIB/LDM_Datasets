To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SIR-RL: Reinforcement Learning for Optimized Policy Control during Epidemiological Outbreaks in Emerging Market and Developing Economies" by Maeghal Jain et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study uses population-level epidemiological data and GDP data, which suggests that specific datasets will be referenced.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the impact of COVID-19 and the need for data-driven decision-making, hinting at the datasets used for analysis. However, I need to locate the specific datasets mentioned.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets or data sources**. In this paper, the authors mention that the population-level epidemiological data can be obtained from the "Our World In Data COVID-19" dataset and provide a specific URL. They also mention that quarterly GDP data can be obtained from the "Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development" (OECD) and provide another URL. This is crucial information for dataset extraction.

Now, I will compile the full citations for these datasets as follows:

1. **Our World In Data COVID-19 Dataset**:
   > Our World In Data. *COVID-19 Data Repository by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University*. Available at: https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus. Accessed: 2024-01-12.

2. **OECD Main Economic Indicators**:
   > Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). *Main Economic Indicators - Complete Database*. Available at: https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/economics/data/main-economic-indicators/main-economic-indicators-complete-database_data-00052-en. Accessed: 2024-01-12.

After gathering this information, I will ensure that I accurately represent each dataset in the required format, emphasizing the importance of including full citations for each dataset as they provide the necessary context and credibility for the research findings.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for further processing or review, ensuring that all relevant details are captured succinctly and clearly.
