To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Localize, Understand, Collaborate: Semantic-Aware Dragging via Intention Reasoner" by Xing Cui et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to look for any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the development of a new framework for drag-based editing, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will need to dig deeper into the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4) where datasets are typically discussed. I will look for any specific mentions of datasets used for training or evaluation. In this case, the authors describe the training of a quality discriminator, which involves a dataset of 10,000 high-fidelity images and 10,000 low-fidelity images. However, they do not provide a specific name for this dataset.

I will also check the **references section** to see if any datasets are cited there. The references may include datasets used in previous works that the authors have built upon. However, in this paper, the references primarily cite other research papers and do not provide specific dataset citations.

Since the paper does not provide a formal name for the dataset used for training the quality discriminator, I will note that the dataset consists of high-fidelity and low-fidelity images but will not be able to provide a full citation for it.

Now, I will summarize the findings regarding the datasets:

1. **Quality Discriminator Dataset**: The paper mentions a dataset comprising 10,000 high-fidelity images and 10,000 low-fidelity images used for training the quality discriminator. However, no specific citation or name is provided for this dataset.

Since there are no formal citations for the datasets mentioned in the paper, I will document the findings accordingly, noting the lack of specific dataset names or citations.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format for clarity, ensuring that I highlight the absence of formal dataset citations while summarizing the dataset details as described in the paper.
