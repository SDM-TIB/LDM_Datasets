To extract datasets from the research paper titled "COVID-19 therapy target discovery with context-aware literature mining" by Matej Martinc et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors utilize the **CORD-19 dataset**, which is a significant dataset related to COVID-19 literature. This is a strong lead, so I will look for more details in the subsequent sections.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (CORD-19 database)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the dataset. They mention that the CORD-19 corpus consists of over 135,000 scholarly articles related to COVID-19, with specific statistics about the number of papers and tokens. This section confirms that the CORD-19 dataset is indeed used in their research.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the CORD-19 dataset. The authors reference the dataset as follows:
> "CORD-19 dataset: Allen Institute for AI. CORD-19 Research Challenge. Available at: https://www.kaggle.com/allen-institute-for-ai/CORD-19-research-challenge."

Now, I will summarize the dataset information:

1. **CORD-19 Dataset**: This dataset is a comprehensive collection of scholarly articles related to COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, and other coronaviruses. It includes over 135,000 articles, with more than 68,000 available in full text. The dataset is intended for the global research community to facilitate the application of NLP and AI techniques in combating the COVID-19 pandemic.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry with the full citation into a structured format for further processing.

In summary, I have identified the CORD-19 dataset as the primary dataset used in the research, and I have retrieved its full citation for documentation purposes.
