To extract datasets from the research paper titled "PDFTriage: Question Answering over Long, Structured Documents" by Jon Saad-Falcon et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the datasets discussed. The abstract mentions a benchmark dataset consisting of **900+ human-generated questions over 80 structured documents**, which indicates that a dataset is indeed present.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Dataset Construction)**, where the authors describe how they constructed their evaluation dataset. Here, they specify that they collected **908 questions across 82 documents**, which is a crucial detail. They also mention the categories of questions included in the dataset, such as "document structure questions," "table reasoning questions," and "trick questions."

In this section, the authors provide insights into the methodology used to create the dataset, including the use of Mechanical Turk for question collection and the sampling of documents from the common crawl. This information is essential for understanding the dataset's context and purpose.

I will also check the **References section** to find any citations related to the datasets mentioned. However, it appears that the dataset is original to this research and does not reference an external dataset. Therefore, I will note the dataset's details as described in the paper.

The dataset can be summarized as follows:

1. **PDFTriage Evaluation Dataset**: This dataset consists of **908 human-written questions** across **82 structured documents**. It includes various question types aimed at evaluating document question-answering tasks.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring to include the full citation for the dataset as it appears in the paper:

- For the **PDFTriage Evaluation Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Jon Saad-Falcon, Joe Barrow, Alexa Siu, Ani Nenkova, David Seunghyun Yoon, Ryan A. Rossi, Franck Dernoncourt. *PDFTriage: Question Answering over Long, Structured Documents*. Stanford University and Adobe Research.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will prepare the dataset entry for review or further processing.
