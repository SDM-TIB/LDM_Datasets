To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Just-in-time AI Interventions for Improving Human Labeling Quality and Domain Knowledge in Crowdsourcing Systems" by Chu Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study and may mention specific datasets used for evaluation or experimentation.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors often discuss the context of their research and may reference datasets that are foundational to their work. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or related studies that might indicate the datasets used.

Then, I will examine the **methods section**, particularly any subsections that detail the experimental setup or data collection processes. This section is likely to contain specific information about the datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

In the **results section**, I will check for any additional mentions of datasets, especially if the authors discuss the outcomes of their experiments in relation to specific datasets. This can provide further confirmation of the datasets used.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to ensure that the datasets can be located by others.

For this paper, I anticipate finding the following datasets:

1. **Project Sidewalk Dataset**: This dataset is mentioned as containing crowdsourced image labels applied to Google Street View panoramas across multiple cities. I will look for the specific citation related to this dataset.

2. **Expert-Validated Labels**: The paper discusses the use of expert-validated labels for fine-tuning the model. I will check if there is a specific citation for the methodology or dataset used for these expert validations.

3. **Other Datasets**: The authors may reference other datasets used for comparison or as part of their methodology, such as datasets related to urban accessibility or previous studies.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research.

Finally, I will format the dataset information according to the specified requirements, ensuring clarity and completeness for future reference or analysis.
