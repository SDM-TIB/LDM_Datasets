To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Hardness-Aware Scene Synthesis for Semi-Supervised 3D Object Detection" by Shuai Zeng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on the **KITTI** and **Waymo** datasets, which suggests these are the datasets I need to focus on.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of these datasets in the **introduction**. The authors discuss the challenges of 3D object detection and the importance of labeled training data, which reinforces the relevance of the datasets mentioned in the abstract.

In the **experiments section**, particularly in **section 4.1**, the authors explicitly state that they conducted experiments on the **KITTI** and **Waymo** datasets. They provide details about the proportions of labeled data used for each dataset, confirming their significance in the study.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. **KITTI Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Andreas Geiger, Philip Lenz, Christoph Stiller, and Raquel Urtasun. *Vision meets robotics: The KITTI dataset*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA), pages 1231–1237, 2013.

2. **Waymo Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Pei Sun, Henrik Kretzschmar, Xerxes Dotiwalla, Aurelien Chouard, Vijaysai Patnaik, Paul Tsui, James Guo, Yin Zhou, Yuning Chai, Benjamin Caine, et al. *Scalability in perception for autonomous driving: Waymo open dataset*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 2446–2454, 2020.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

- **KITTI Dataset**: A widely used dataset for 3D object detection containing various scenes with labeled objects.
- **Waymo Dataset**: A large-scale dataset providing extensive annotations for 3D object detection in autonomous driving scenarios.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly presents the datasets and their citations, ensuring that all relevant details are included for future reference or processing.
