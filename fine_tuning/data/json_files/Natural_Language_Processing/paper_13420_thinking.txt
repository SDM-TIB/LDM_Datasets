To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Real-Time Egocentric Segment Captioning for The Blind and Visually Impaired in RGB-D Theatre Images" by Khadidja Delloul and Slimane Larabi, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the **TS-RGBD dataset**, which is a key dataset for this research. This indicates that there is at least one dataset to extract.

Next, I will look closely at **section 4 (State-of-the-Art Limitations)**, where the authors explicitly state that their solution is applied to the **TS-RGBD dataset**. They describe it as a dataset of RGB-D images for theatre scenes, which is crucial for their experiments. This section confirms the dataset's relevance and provides context for its use.

In **section 6.2 (Dataset and Data Preprocessing)**, the authors provide further details about the **TS-RGBD dataset**, including how it was collected using the Microsoft Kinect v1 sensor and manually annotated using the “LabelMe” framework. This section is important for understanding the dataset's characteristics and the methodology behind its creation.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the **TS-RGBD dataset**. The relevant citation is:
> L. Benhamida, K. Delloul, S. Larabi. *TS-RGBD Dataset: a Novel Dataset for Theatre Scenes Description for People with Visual Impairments*. (preprint) Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (2023). https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2308.01035

Having gathered this information, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring to include the full citation as it is critical for proper attribution.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for output, ensuring that it is structured correctly and ready for further processing or review.
