To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Improve Student’s Reasoning Generalizability through Cascading Decomposed CoTs Distillation" by Chengwei Dai et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions "extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of CasCoD on both IND and OOD benchmark reasoning datasets," which indicates that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they explicitly list the datasets, which is crucial for my extraction process.

1. **BIG-Bench Hard (BBH)**: This dataset is described as comprising 27 challenging tasks covering arithmetic and symbolic reasoning. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Suzgun, A., Scales, N., Schärli, N., Gehrmann, S., Tay, Y., Chung, H. W., Chowdhery, A., Le, Q. V., & Zhou, D. (2023). Challenging big-bench tasks and whether chain-of-thought can solve them. In ACL (Findings), pages 13003–13051. Association for Computational Linguistics.

2. **BIG-Bench Sub (BB-sub)**: This dataset is a filtered version of the BIG-Bench dataset, focusing on tasks related to "multiple-choice" and "reasoning." The citation for this dataset is:
   > Guo, G., Zhao, R., Tang, T., & Wen, J. R. (2023). Beyond imitation: Leveraging fine-grained quality signals for alignment. CoRR, abs/2311.04072.

3. **AGIEval**: This is a human-centric benchmark used to assess reasoning abilities, with tasks spanning various domains. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Zhong, W., Cui, R., Guo, Y., Liang, Y., Lu, S., Wang, Y., Saied, A., Chen, W., & Duan, N. (2023). AGIEval: A human-centric benchmark for evaluating foundation models. CoRR, abs/2304.06364.

4. **AI2 Reasoning Challenge (ARC)**: This dataset consists of ARC-Easy and ARC-Challenge, with the former containing simpler questions and the latter more complex ones. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Clark, P., Cowhey, I., Etzioni, O., Khot, T., Sabharwal, A., Schoenick, C., & Tafjord, O. (2018). Think you have solved question answering? Try ARC, the AI2 reasoning challenge. CoRR, abs/1803.05457.

After identifying these datasets, I will ensure that I have the correct citations for each one, as they are essential for proper documentation and referencing.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that can be used for further processing or review, ensuring that each dataset is clearly defined and properly cited.
