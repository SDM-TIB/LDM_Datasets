To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Integrating Item Relevance in Training Loss for Sequential Recommender Systems" by Andrea Bacciu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often highlights the datasets used for experiments.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention conducting experiments on four datasets typically used in this research domain. This indicates that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental setup section** (Section 4), where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention:

1. **MovieLens-1M**: A popular benchmark dataset for recommendation systems containing 1 million user ratings.
2. **MovieLens-100K**: Another version of the MovieLens dataset, containing 100,000 user ratings.
3. **Foursquare NYC**: A dataset consisting of check-in records from New York, containing 227,428 records.
4. **Foursquare TKY**: A dataset with check-in records from Tokyo, containing 573,703 records.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

- For **MovieLens-1M** and **MovieLens-100K**, the citation is:
  > F. Maxwell Harper and Joseph A. Konstan. *The MovieLens Datasets: History and Context*. In ACM Transactions on Interactive Intelligent Systems, 5(4), 2015. https://doi.org/10.1145/2827872

- For **Foursquare NYC** and **Foursquare TKY**, the citation is:
  > Dingqi Yang, Daqing Zhang, Vincent W Zheng, and Zhiyong Yu. *Modeling user activity preference by leveraging user spatial temporal characteristics in LBSNs*. In Proceedings of the 2014 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining, pages 129â€“142, 2014.

With the datasets and their citations identified, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their proper citations.
