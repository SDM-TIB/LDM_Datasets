To extract datasets from the research paper titled "C-ICL: Contrastive In-context Learning for Information Extraction" by Ying Mo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses experiments on various datasets but does not specify their names. This indicates that I need to look further into the paper.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section. Here, the authors mention advancements in information extraction and reference various tasks but do not provide specific dataset names. This suggests that I should continue to the methodology and experimental sections for more detailed information.

I will then focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. In **subsection 4.1 (Datasets)**, they list the datasets for Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Relation Extraction (RE):

1. **CoNLL03**: This dataset is used for NER tasks and is a well-known benchmark in the field.
2. **ACE04**: Another dataset for NER tasks, which is also widely recognized.
3. **ACE05-E**: This dataset is a variant of ACE05, specifically for NER tasks.
4. **CoNLL04**: This dataset is used for relation extraction tasks.
5. **ACE05-R**: This dataset is a variant of ACE05, specifically for relation extraction tasks.
6. **NYT**: A dataset used for relation extraction, derived from the New York Times articles.
7. **SciERC**: A dataset for relation extraction in scientific literature.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference and further processing.
