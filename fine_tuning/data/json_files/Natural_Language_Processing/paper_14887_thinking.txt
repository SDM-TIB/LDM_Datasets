To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Automatic Identification of Stone-Handling Behaviour in Japanese Macaques Using LabGym" by Théo Ardoin and Cédric Sueur, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's objectives and may hint at the datasets used, while the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, as it typically contains detailed descriptions of the datasets used for training and testing the models. In this paper, the authors mention that they trained their AI model using video data of Japanese macaques, specifically focusing on stone-handling behaviours. I will look for specific mentions of datasets, including any numerical details about the number of videos or images used.

In the **results section**, I will check for any additional information regarding the datasets, such as their effectiveness in training the AI or any performance metrics related to the datasets. This section may also provide insights into the quality and characteristics of the datasets.

From my reading, I will identify the following datasets:

1. **Annotated Images of Japanese Macaques**: The authors mention that they annotated images extracted from videos, resulting in a dataset of 4,290 images with annotations for 11,945 individuals. This dataset is crucial for training the AI detector.

2. **Videos of Stone-Handling Behaviours**: The authors used 85 videos, totaling 54 minutes and 35 seconds, to create animations for training the categoriser AI. This dataset focuses on specific behaviours like 'Rub in hands' and 'Rub and roll on the ground'.

Now, I will look into the **references section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The citations may not always be explicitly stated as datasets, but I will look for any papers or sources that describe the datasets used in this research.

For the **Annotated Images of Japanese Macaques**, the citation is:
> Labuguen R, Matsumoto J, Negrete SB, et al. *MacaquePose: a novel ‘in the wild’ macaque monkey pose dataset for markerless motion capture*. Frontiers in Behavioural Neuroscience, 14:581154, 2021.

For the **videos of stone-handling behaviours**, the authors do not provide a specific citation for the videos used, but they mention that the videos were obtained from Cédric Sueur and his team. Therefore, I will note that the videos are part of ongoing research and may not have a formal citation.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This structured approach will help ensure that I accurately capture all relevant information regarding the datasets used in this research paper.
