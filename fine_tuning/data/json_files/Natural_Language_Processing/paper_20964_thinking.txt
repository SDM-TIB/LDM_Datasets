To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Benchmark Evaluation of Clinical Named Entity Recognition in French" by Nesrine Bannour et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the paper evaluates several masked language models using "three publicly available corpora for clinical named entity recognition in French." This suggests that there are specific datasets that I need to locate.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Corpora)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their evaluation. Here, I will look for detailed descriptions of each dataset, including their names, sizes, and any specific characteristics that are relevant to the study.

The paper mentions three datasets:

1. **DEFT**: This dataset is a subset of 167 clinical cases from the CAS corpus, annotated with 13 types of clinical entities and five attributes. It is divided into a training set of 85 documents, a validation set of 20 documents, and a test set of 62 documents.

2. **E3C**: This is a European corpus of clinical cases, specifically the French sub-corpus, which comprises 1,615 clinical cases. It is annotated with six types of named clinical entities and includes a unique identifier for each entity from the UMLS metathesaurus.

3. **QUAERO French Med**: This dataset consists of documents from two text genres: the EMEA subcorpus, which includes 13 patient information leaflets, and the MEDLINE subcorpus, which contains 2,500 titles of scientific articles. It is annotated with 10 types of clinical entities derived from UMLS semantic groups.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
