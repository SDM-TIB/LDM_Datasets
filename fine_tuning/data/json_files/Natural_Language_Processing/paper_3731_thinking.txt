To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Larger-Scale Transformers for Multilingual Masked Language Modeling" by Naman Goyal et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors present results from two larger multilingual masked language models, which suggests that datasets are involved, particularly in the context of cross-lingual understanding.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Pretraining and evaluation)**, where the authors describe the data used for pretraining and evaluation. Here, they mention the **CC100 dataset**, which is crucial for their models. I will note the details provided about this dataset, including its size and the number of tokens.

In **section 2.2 (Evaluation)**, the authors mention several benchmarks used for evaluation, including **XNLI**, **MLQA**, and **XQuad**. I will extract information about these datasets, including their purpose and any relevant statistics provided in the text.

I will also check the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. The citations are essential for proper attribution and to provide readers with sources for further exploration.

The datasets I will extract are:

1. **CC100 Dataset**: This dataset is mentioned as containing 167 billion tokens across 100 languages. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Guillaume Wenzek, Marie-Anne Lachaux, Alexis Conneau, Vishrav Chaudhary, Francisco Guzman, Armand Joulin, and Edouard Grave. *CCNet: Extracting high quality monolingual datasets from web crawl data*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1911.00359, 2019.

2. **XNLI Dataset**: This dataset is used for cross-lingual natural language inference and includes ground-truth dev and test sets in 15 languages. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Alexis Conneau, Ruty Rinott, Guillaume Lample, Adina Williams, Samuel R. Bowman, Holger Schwenk, and Veselin Stoyanov. *XNLI: Evaluating cross-lingual sentence representations*. In EMNLP. Association for Computational Linguistics, 2018.

3. **MLQA Dataset**: This dataset is used for evaluating cross-lingual extractive question answering. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Patrick Lewis, Barlas OÄŸuz, Ruty Rinott, Sebastian Riedel, and Holger Schwenk. *MLQA: Evaluating cross-lingual extractive question answering*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1910.07475, 2019.

4. **XQuad Dataset**: This dataset extends SQuAD to more languages for cross-lingual question answering. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Mikel Artetxe, Sebastian Ruder, and Dani Yogatama. *On the cross-lingual transferability of monolingual representations*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1910.11856, 2019.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
