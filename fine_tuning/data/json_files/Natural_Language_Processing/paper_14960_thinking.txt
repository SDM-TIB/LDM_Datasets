To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "DNA: Denoised Neighborhood Aggregation for Fine-grained Category Discovery" by Wenbin An et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention the datasets used for evaluation. 

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Experimental Settings)**, where the authors discuss the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention three benchmark datasets:

1. **CLINC**: This dataset is described as an intent detection dataset from multiple domains, with 10 coarse-grained categories and 150 fine-grained categories. The training set contains 18,000 samples, and the test set has 1,000 samples.

2. **WOS**: This dataset is a paper classification dataset with 7 coarse-grained categories and 33 fine-grained categories. It consists of 8,362 training samples and 2,420 test samples.

3. **HWU64**: This dataset is an assistant query classification dataset, featuring 18 coarse-grained categories and 64 fine-grained categories. It includes 8,954 training samples and 1,031 test samples.

To confirm the details of these datasets, I will also check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **CLINC**, the citation is:
  > Larson, S., Mahendran, A., Peper, J. J., Clarke, C., Lee, A., Hill, P., Kummerfeld, J. K., Leach, K., Laurenzano, M. A., Tang, L., et al. (2019). An evaluation dataset for intent classification and out-of-scope prediction. *arXiv preprint arXiv:1909.02027*.

- For **WOS**, the citation is:
  > Kowsari, K., Brown, D. E., Heidarysafa, M., Meimandi, K. J., Gerber, M. S., & Barnes, L. E. (2017). HDLTex: Hierarchical deep learning for text classification. In *Machine Learning and Applications (ICMLA), 2017 16th IEEE International Conference on*. IEEE.

- For **HWU64**, the citation is:
  > Liu, X., Eshghi, A., Swietojanski, P., & Rieser, V. (2021). Benchmarking natural language understanding services for building conversational agents. In *Increasing Naturalness and Flexibility in Spoken Dialogue Interaction*. Springer.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or processing. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets along with their full citations as required.
