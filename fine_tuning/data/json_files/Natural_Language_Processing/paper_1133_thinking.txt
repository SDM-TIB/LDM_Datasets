To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Improved Multi-Stage Training of Online Attention-Based Encoder-Decoder Models" by Abhinav Garg et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors achieved a word error rate (WER) of 5.04% and 4.48% on the Librispeech test-clean data, indicating that the Librispeech dataset is used in their experiments. This is a strong lead.

Next, I will look into **section 4.1 (Datasets and training)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. They state that all experiments are reported on the publicly available **Librispeech corpus**. This section will provide more details about the dataset, including its characteristics and how it was utilized in their research.

In this section, the authors describe the **Librispeech corpus** as a dataset consisting of 1000 hours of transcribed speech data, which is a well-known benchmark for automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems. They also mention that the dev and test sets consist of clean and other subsets, which is important for understanding the dataset's structure.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Librispeech dataset. The citation is as follows:
> V. Panayotov, G. Chen, D. Povey, and S. Khudanpur. *Librispeech: An ASR corpus based on public domain audio books*. In 2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP), April 2015, pp. 5206â€“5210.

With this information, I can summarize the dataset extraction process:

1. **Identify the dataset**: The primary dataset used in the experiments is the **Librispeech corpus**.
2. **Gather details**: The dataset consists of 1000 hours of transcribed speech data, with dev and test sets that include clean and other subsets.
3. **Find the citation**: The full citation for the dataset is located in the References section.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines the dataset and its citation, ensuring that all necessary details are included for future reference or processing.
