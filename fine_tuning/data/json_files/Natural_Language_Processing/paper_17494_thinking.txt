To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Catch Me if You Can: Effective Honeypot Placement in Dynamic AD Attack Graphs" by Huy Q. Ngo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention any datasets used for experiments. In this case, the authors discuss the use of "realistic dynamic AD graphs" and "authentication data," which suggests that there are datasets involved.

Next, I will look for specific sections that typically contain dataset information, such as **section II (Background and Related Work)** and **section V (Evaluation)**. In these sections, the authors may describe the datasets used for their experiments in detail.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention two key datasets:

1. **Synthetic Graphs**: The authors generated synthetic Active Directory (AD) graphs using tools like DBCreator and Adsimulator. They describe the characteristics of these synthetic datasets, including the number of nodes and edges.

2. **AuthOrg Data**: This dataset includes authentication events observed over a 102-day period from an anonymous organization, detailing user sessions and their interactions with computers in the network.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the **References section** of the paper:

- For the **synthetic graphs**, the citation is:
  > DBCreator. *DBCreator: A Tool for Generating Active Directory Graphs*. Available at: https://github.com/BloodHoundAD/BloodHound-Tools/tree/master/DBCreator.

- For the **AuthOrg data**, since it is sourced from an anonymous organization, it may not have a formal citation. However, I will note that it is referenced as "AuthOrg data" in the paper.

Finally, I will compile the extracted datasets into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research.
