To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Spatial-Semantic Collaborative Cropping for User Generated Content" by Yukun Su et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors propose a new cropping benchmark, which suggests that a dataset is involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of cropping user-generated content and mention the need for a dataset to address these challenges. This reinforces the idea that a dataset is central to their research.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, where the authors explicitly mention the construction of a new dataset called **UGCrop5K**. They describe it as containing 450,000 annotated candidate crops across 5,000 images, which is a significant dataset for their research.

I will also look for any references to other datasets used in their experiments. The authors mention utilizing parts of existing datasets, including:

1. **KoNViD-1k**: A dataset for video quality assessment.
2. **LIVE-VQC**: Another dataset for video quality assessment.
3. **YouTube-UGC**: A dataset for user-generated content from YouTube.
4. **Bilibili**: A dataset from a social video website.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the **References section** of the paper:

- For **UGCrop5K**, since it is a new dataset introduced by the authors, I will cite it as:
  > Su, Y., Cao, Y., Deng, J., Rao, F., Wu, Q. (2023). *UGCrop5K: A Large Densely Labeled Dataset for User Generated Content Cropping*. [Dataset].

- For **KoNViD-1k**, the citation is:
  > Hosu, V., Hahn, F., Jenadeleh, M., Lin, H., Men, H., SzirÃ¡nyi, T., Li, S., & Saupe, D. (2017). *The Konstanz Natural Video Database (KoNViD-1k)*. In Proceedings of the 2017 Ninth International Conference on Quality of Multimedia Experience (QoMEX), 1-6.

- For **LIVE-VQC**, the citation is:
  > Sinno, Z., & Bovik, A. C. (2018). *Large-scale study of perceptual video quality*. IEEE Transactions on Image Processing, 28(2), 612-627.

- For **YouTube-UGC**, the citation is:
  > Wang, Y., Inguva, S., & Adsumilli, B. (2019). *YouTube UGC dataset for video compression research*. In 2019 IEEE 21st International Workshop on Multimedia Signal Processing (MMSP), 1-5.

- For **Bilibili**, the citation is:
  > Ma, S., Cui, L., Dai, D., Wei, F., & Sun, X. (2019). *LiveBot: Generating Live Video Comments Based on Visual and Textual Contexts*. In AAAI 2019.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
