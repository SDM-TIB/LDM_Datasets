To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Novice Learner and Expert Tutor: Evaluating Math Reasoning Abilities of Large Language Models with Misconceptions" by Naiming Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on evaluating LLMs' mathematical reasoning capabilities, but I need to look for specific datasets.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention several benchmark datasets that LLMs have been evaluated on, specifically **GSM8K**, **MATH**, and **NumGLUE**. This indicates that these datasets are relevant to the study, and I need to gather more details about them.

Next, I will check the **section 1.3 (Dataset)**, where the authors describe their own dataset sourced from Eedi's platform. They mention that it consists of multiple-choice grade-school level math questions, which is crucial information for my extraction.

I will also look at the **appendices** for any additional details about the dataset, including preprocessing steps and statistics. The authors provide a comprehensive overview of the dataset, including the number of questions and misconceptions, which is important for understanding its scope.

Now, I will compile the full citations for the datasets mentioned in the paper:

1. **GSM8K**: The citation is:
   > Karl Cobbe, Vineet Kosaraju, Mohammad Bavarian, Mark Chen, Heewoo Jun, Lukasz Kaiser, Matthias Plappert, Jerry Tworek, Jacob Hilton, Reiichiro Nakano, et al. 2021. *Training verifiers to solve math word problems*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2110.14168.

2. **MATH**: The citation is:
   > Dan Hendrycks, Collin Burns, Saurav Kadavath, Akul Arora, Steven Basart, Eric Tang, Dawn Song, and Jacob Steinhardt. 2021. *Measuring mathematical problem solving with the math dataset*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2103.03874.

3. **NumGLUE**: The citation is:
   > Swaroop Mishra, Arindam Mitra, Neeraj Varshney, Bhavdeep Sachdeva, Peter Clark, Chitta Baral, and Ashwin Kalyan. 2022. *Numglue: A suite of fundamental yet challenging mathematical reasoning tasks*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2204.05660.

4. **Eedi Dataset**: Since this dataset is described in the paper but does not have a formal citation, I will note it as:
   > Eedi's platform dataset, which includes multiple-choice grade-school level math questions, with expert-curated student misconceptions.

After gathering all this information, I will ensure that I have accurately captured the details of each dataset, including their significance in the context of the research. This will allow me to create a structured output that reflects the datasets used in the study, along with their citations for reference.
