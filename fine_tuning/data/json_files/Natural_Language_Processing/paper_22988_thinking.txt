To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Think Before You Act: A Two-Stage Framework for Mitigating Gender Bias Towards Vision-Language Tasks" by Yunqi Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiment sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the development of a framework (GAMA) to mitigate gender bias in vision-language tasks, which suggests that datasets may be involved in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiment Setup)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they provide a table (Table 1) that lists the datasets along with their statistics. I will extract the names and descriptions of the datasets mentioned here.

The datasets identified in the paper are:

1. **Localized Narratives Dataset**: This dataset is used for training the narrative generation model. It is associated with Open Images and is designed to depict image regions covered by a mouse trace, associating specific image regions with specific words in the narrative.

2. **MSCOCO Captions**: This dataset is utilized for image captioning tasks. It consists of images with five human-annotated captions each, and the authors specify the training, validation, and test splits used in their experiments.

3. **Flickr30K**: This dataset is used for image search tasks alongside MSCOCO. The authors mention using the Karpathy split for training and validation.

4. **VisoGender**: This dataset benchmarks occupation-related gender bias in vision-language models. It is used to evaluate the performance of GAMA in aligning images with correct gender pronouns.

5. **VL-Bias**: This dataset is mentioned as a benchmark for measuring gender bias, which includes 24K image-text pairs related to activities and occupations.

Now, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
