To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The Geometry of Multilingual Language Model Representations" by Tyler A. Chang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study and may mention specific datasets used for analysis. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the research, which might include references to datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors discuss the use of the XLM-R model and the OSCAR corpus, which is a significant dataset for their experiments. I will note the details provided about this dataset, including its purpose and any relevant statistics.

In the **experimental details** section, the authors describe how they utilized the OSCAR corpus, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's role in their research. I will extract the relevant information about the OSCAR corpus, including its size and the nature of the data it contains.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. For the OSCAR corpus, I will look for the citation provided by the authors, which is essential for proper attribution.

The citation for the OSCAR corpus is:
> Julien Abadji, Pedro Javier Ortiz Suárez, Laurent Rosemary, and Benoît Sagot. *Ungoliant: An optimized pipeline for the generation of a very large-scale multilingual web corpus*. In Proceedings of the Workshop on Challenges in the Management of Large Corpora, pages 1–9, 2021.

Now, I will compile the extracted information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for each dataset. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research.

In summary, I will:
1. Review the abstract and introduction for initial mentions of datasets.
2. Identify the OSCAR corpus as the primary dataset used in the experiments.
3. Extract details about the OSCAR corpus from the experimental section.
4. Retrieve the full citation for the OSCAR corpus from the references.
5. Compile the information into a structured format for clarity and completeness.
