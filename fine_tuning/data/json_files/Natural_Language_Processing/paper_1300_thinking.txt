To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Human-free quality estimation of document summaries" by Oleg Vasilyev et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to find any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the introduction of BLANC, a method for estimating summary quality, but does not explicitly mention any datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors discuss existing methods for summary evaluation, such as ROUGE and human evaluation. They mention the need for a dataset annotated with human quality scores for training models, but they do not specify any particular datasets at this point.

Moving on to the **methods section**, I will look for any specific datasets used for training or evaluation. The authors describe the BLANC method and its two versions (BLANC-help and BLANC-tune), but they do not provide details about datasets in this section either.

In the **validation section**, the authors mention assembling 555 summary-text pairs for human scoring, which were taken from the CNN/Daily Mail dataset. This is a significant dataset that I need to document.

In the **comparison with human evaluation scores section**, they refer to summaries generated from the CNN/Daily Mail dataset, confirming its use in their experiments.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citation for the CNN/Daily Mail dataset:

- For the **CNN/Daily Mail dataset**, the citation is:
  > Karl Moritz Hermann, Tomáš Kočiský, Edward Grefenstette, Lasse Espeholt, Will Kay, Mustafa Suleyman, and Phil Blunsom. *Teaching machines to read and comprehend*. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 28, pages 1693–1701. Curran Associates, Inc., 2015.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry for the CNN/Daily Mail dataset, ensuring to include the full citation as required.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry in the specified format for further processing or review.
