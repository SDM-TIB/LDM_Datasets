To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ReCode: Robustness Evaluation of Code Generation Models" by Shiqi Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the creation of a benchmark called **ReCode** for evaluating code generation models, which suggests that there may be datasets involved in this evaluation. The introduction further elaborates on the importance of robustness in code generation and hints at the use of existing datasets for benchmarking.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **methodology** section, particularly where the authors describe their evaluation framework. Here, they mention using **HumanEval** and **MBPP** datasets for demonstrating their ReCode benchmark. This is a clear indication that these datasets are integral to their research.

I will then check the **experiments** section to confirm the usage of these datasets. The authors provide detailed evaluations based on the performance of various models on the HumanEval and MBPP datasets, which reinforces their significance in the study.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. **HumanEval Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Chen, M., Tworek, J., Jun, H., Yuan, Q., Pinto, H. P. d. O., Kaplan, J., ... & Le, Q. V. (2021). Program synthesis with large language models. *ArXiv preprint arXiv:2108.07732*.

2. **MBPP Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Austin, J., Odena, A., Nye, M. I., Bosma, M., Michalewski, H., Dohan, D., ... & Sutton, C. (2021). Program synthesis with large language models. *ArXiv preprint arXiv:2108.07732*.

Now that I have the dataset names and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that highlights each dataset's name, description, and full citation.

In summary, I have identified the following datasets from the paper:
- **HumanEval**: A dataset used for evaluating code generation models.
- **MBPP**: Another dataset utilized for benchmarking the robustness of code generation models.

I will ensure that the full citations are included for each dataset to maintain academic integrity and provide proper credit to the original sources.
