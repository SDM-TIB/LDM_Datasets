To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Methodology to Study the Impact of Spiking Neural Network Parameters considering Event-Based Automotive Data" by Iqra Bano et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract mentions the **NCARS dataset**, which is a strong indication that this dataset is central to the research.

Next, I will look for specific sections that discuss datasets in detail. In this paper, the **section on Event-based Automotive Data** provides a description of the **Prophesee NCARS Dataset**. The authors mention that this dataset contains around 24,000 samples, each with a length of 100ms, and includes information such as spatial coordinates, timestamps, and polarity of brightness variation.

I will also check the **experiments section** to confirm that the NCARS dataset is used for training and testing the proposed methodology. The authors state that they split the dataset into training and testing samples, which further validates its use in their experiments.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citation for the NCARS dataset. The paper cites the dataset as follows:

- **Prophesee NCARS Dataset**:
  > A. Sironi et al., “HATS: Histograms of Averaged Time Surfaces for Robust Event-Based Object Classification,” in IEEE Conf. on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2018, pp. 1731–1740.

With this information, I will summarize the dataset details:

1. **Dataset Name**: Prophesee NCARS Dataset
   - **Description**: Contains around 24,000 samples, each with a length of 100ms. The samples encode spatial coordinates, timestamps, and polarity of brightness variation.
   - **Citation**: A. Sironi et al., “HATS: Histograms of Averaged Time Surfaces for Robust Event-Based Object Classification,” in IEEE Conf. on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2018, pp. 1731–1740.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or processing. This systematic approach ensures that I accurately capture the datasets and their citations from the research paper.
