To extract datasets from the research paper titled "How to Collaborate: Towards Maximizing the Generalization Performance in Cross-Silo Federated Learning" by Yuchang Sun et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

Next, I will look for specific sections that typically contain dataset information, such as **section 3 (Preliminaries)** and **section 7 (Simulation Results)**. In these sections, the authors may describe the datasets used for experiments, including their characteristics and how they were utilized in the study.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention using the **CIFAR-10 dataset** in their experiments. They describe how clients collaborate to classify data samples extracted from this dataset. I will note the details provided about the dataset, including its structure and the number of classes.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the CIFAR-10 dataset. The citation is typically formatted according to the style used in the paper, which may include the authors, title, publication venue, and year.

The full citation for the CIFAR-10 dataset is:
> Alex Krizhevsky et al. "Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images." 2009.

Additionally, I will look for any other datasets mentioned in the paper. The authors also refer to the **FMNIST dataset** in their experiments. I will extract the relevant details about this dataset as well.

The full citation for the FMNIST dataset is:
> Han Xiao, Kashif Rasul, and Roland Vollgraf. "Fashion-MNIST: A novel image dataset for benchmarking machine learning algorithms." 2017.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and that the full citations are included for reference. This structured approach will help ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations from the paper.
