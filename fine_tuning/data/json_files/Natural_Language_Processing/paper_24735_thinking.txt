To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SecGenAI: Enhancing Security of Cloud-based Generative AI Applications within Australian Critical Technologies of National Interest," I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly referenced. The abstract discusses the SecGenAI framework and its focus on security challenges in Generative AI applications, but it does not mention specific datasets.

Next, I will examine the **background and related works sections** to identify any datasets that may have been used in previous studies or frameworks referenced by the authors. This could provide insight into datasets relevant to their research.

I will then look closely at the **experiments or analysis sections** of the paper, as these sections often detail the datasets used for evaluation or testing. If the authors conducted experiments, they might have used specific datasets to validate their framework.

After identifying any datasets mentioned, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets.

If the paper does not explicitly mention datasets, I will note that as well, indicating that the focus is more on the framework and security measures rather than empirical evaluation using specific datasets.

Finally, I will compile the findings, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation, if available. This structured approach will help ensure that I capture all relevant information regarding datasets in the paper.
