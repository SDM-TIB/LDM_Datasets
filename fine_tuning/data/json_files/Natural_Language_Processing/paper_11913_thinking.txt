To extract datasets from the research paper titled "LLQL: Logistic Likelihood Q-Learning for Reinforcement Learning" by Outongyi Lv and Bingxin Zhou, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and often includes references to datasets used for validation or experiments. 

Next, I will look for specific sections that typically contain dataset information, such as **"Experiments," "Datasets," or "Methodology."** In this paper, I will pay particular attention to any numerical experiments or evaluations mentioned, as they often indicate the datasets used.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention using several environments for their experiments, specifically in the **experiments section**. They refer to environments from the OpenAI Gym and D4RL datasets, which are commonly used in reinforcement learning research.

I will now compile the datasets mentioned:

1. **OpenAI Gym Environments**: The authors mention using various environments from OpenAI Gym, such as LunarLanderContinuous-v2, HalfCheetah-v2, and others. These environments are standard benchmarks in reinforcement learning.

2. **D4RL Datasets**: The authors also refer to datasets from D4RL, which include environments like hopper-medium-v2 and walker2d-medium-v2. These datasets are specifically designed for offline reinforcement learning tasks.

Next, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **OpenAI Gym**:
  > Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L. H., Schneider, J., Schulman, J., Tang, J., & Zaremba, W. (2016). *OpenAI Gym*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01540.

- For **D4RL**:
  > Fu, J., Kumar, A., Nachum, O., Tucker, G., & Levine, S. (2020). *D4RL: Datasets for Deep Data-Driven Reinforcement Learning*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2004.07219.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will summarize the findings in a structured format for clarity and completeness. This will ensure that all relevant information is captured accurately for future reference or processing.
