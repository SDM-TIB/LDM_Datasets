To extract datasets from the research paper titled "EHRMAMBA: Towards Generalizable and Scalable Foundation Models for Electronic Health Records" by Adibvafa Fallahpour et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors evaluate their model on the **MIMIC-IV dataset**, which is a strong indication that this dataset is central to their research.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors describe their experimental setup. In section 4.1, they explicitly mention using the **MIMIC-IV dataset** for their evaluations. This section provides a detailed description of the dataset, including its size and the types of data it contains, which is crucial for understanding its relevance and application in their study.

I will also check the **appendix** for any additional details about the dataset, such as its structure, data splits, and specific features used in the experiments. The appendix confirms that MIMIC-IV includes records from over 431,000 visits and 180,000 patients, which adds context to its significance.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citation for the MIMIC-IV dataset. The relevant citations are:

- For the MIMIC-IV dataset, the citation is:
  > Alistair Johnson, Lucas Bulgarelli, Tom Pollard, Steven Horng, Leo Anthony Celi, and Roger Mark. *MIMIC-IV, a freely accessible electronic health record dataset*. Scientific Data, 10(1):1, January 2023. doi: 10.1038/s41597-022-01899-x. URL: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-022-01899-x.

With this information, I can now summarize the dataset extraction:

1. **MIMIC-IV Dataset**: A comprehensive electronic health record dataset from Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, covering patient data from 2008 to 2019, including records from over 431,000 visits and 180,000 patients.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and future reference.
