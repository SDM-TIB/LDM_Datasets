To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Prompt Smells: An Omen for Undesirable Generative AI Outputs" by Krishna Ronanki et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that may be mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a general overview, but I will focus on sections that typically contain detailed information about datasets.

Next, I will examine the **experiments and results sections** to see if the authors discuss any datasets used for their evaluations or analyses. This is often where datasets are explicitly named and described in terms of their purpose and characteristics.

I will also look for a **dedicated section on datasets** if it exists, as this is common in research papers. In this section, the authors may provide specific details about the datasets, including their size, structure, and any relevant statistics.

After identifying any datasets mentioned in the paper, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets themselves.

If the paper references well-known datasets, I will ensure to include the original citations for those datasets, even if they are not newly introduced in this paper. 

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation formatted correctly.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset information in a structured format for easy review or further processing, ensuring that all citations are accurate and complete.
