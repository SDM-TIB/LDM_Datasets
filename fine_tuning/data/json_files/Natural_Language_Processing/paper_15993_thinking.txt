To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "MC2: Towards Transparent and Culturally-Aware NLP for Minority Languages in China" by Chen Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract introduces the MC2 corpus, which is described as the largest open-source corpus for minority languages in China, specifically mentioning Tibetan, Uyghur, Kazakh, and Mongolian. This indicates that the MC2 corpus is a primary dataset of interest.

Next, I will examine **section 3 (Data Collection and Analysis)**, where the authors detail the creation of the MC2 corpus. They mention that the corpus consists of web crawls and existing datasets, which suggests that there may be multiple datasets involved. I will look for specific names and descriptions of these datasets.

In **subsection 3.3 (Incorporation of Existing Datasets)**, the authors mention incorporating several existing datasets into MC2, including:

1. **CulturaX**: A cleaned collection of multilingual data that supplements the MC2 corpus. The authors note that it contains data for Tibetan and Uyghur, but they also highlight issues with language misidentification.

2. **Wikipedia**: The authors collected Tibetan and Uyghur texts from Wikipedia, which adds to the MC2 corpus.

3. **NLGIW 2023 Shared Task**: This dataset provides an open-source corpus of Tibetan news, which is also included in MC2.

In **section 5 (Continual Pretraining with MC2)**, the authors discuss the performance of models trained with the MC2 corpus, reinforcing its significance as a dataset.

Now, I will gather the full citations for the datasets mentioned. I will refer to the **References section** of the paper for accurate citations:

- For **CulturaX**, the citation is:

- For **Wikipedia**, the citation is:

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets extracted from the paper.
