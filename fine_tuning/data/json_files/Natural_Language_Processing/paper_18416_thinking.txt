To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Byte Pair Encoding Is All You Need For Automatic Bengali Speech Recognition" by Ahnaf Mozib Samin, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract highlights the use of BPE tokenization for Bengali ASR and mentions performance evaluations on specific datasets, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the author discusses the challenges of Bengali ASR and references previous works that may have utilized specific datasets. This section may provide insights into the datasets used in the experiments.

In the **methodology section**, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets used for training and evaluation. The author states that they trained their CNN-based acoustic model using the **SUBAK.KO** dataset, which is described as an annotated Bangla speech dataset with 229 hours of read speech. This is a clear indication of a dataset being utilized.

Additionally, the author mentions using the **LB-ASRTD** and **SHRUTI** datasets for evaluation purposes. The LB-ASRTD dataset is referenced as a large-scale publicly available dataset, while SHRUTI is noted as a full corpus for evaluation.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to retrieve full citations for these datasets:

1. For **SUBAK.KO**, the citation is:
   > Shafkat Kibria, Ahnaf Mozib Samin, M Humayon Kobir, M Shahidur Rahman, M Reza Selim, and M Zafar Iqbal. *Bangladeshi Bangla Speech Corpus for Automatic Speech Recognition Research*. Speech Communication, 136:84–97, 2022.

2. For **LB-ASRTD**, the citation is:
   > Oddur Kjartansson, Supheakmungkol Sarin, Knot Pipatsrisawat, Martin Jansche, and Linne Ha. *Crowd-sourced Speech Corpora for Javanese, Sundanese, Sinhala, Nepali, and Bangladeshi Bengali*. In 6th Workshop on Spoken Language Technologies for Under-Resourced Languages (SLTU 2018). ISCA.

3. For **SHRUTI**, the citation is:
   > Biswajit Das, Sandipan Mandal, and Pabitra Mitra. *Bengali Speech Corpus for Continuous Automatic Speech Recognition System*. In 2011 International Conference on Speech Database and Assessments (Oriental COCOSDA), pages 51–55. IEEE.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented and properly cited.
