To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CFSum: A Coarse-to-Fine Contribution Network for Multimodal Summarization" by Min Xiao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors conducted experiments on a multimodal sentence summarization dataset, which suggests that a specific dataset is being used.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors mention using the **multimodal sentence summarization dataset** in the experiments. They provide statistical information about the dataset, including the number of samples for training, validation, and testing, as well as the average lengths of the source sentences and reference summaries.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The authors reference the dataset as follows:

- For the multimodal sentence summarization dataset, the citation is:
  > Haoran Li, Junnan Zhu, Tianshan Liu, Jiajun Zhang, and Chengqing Zong. *Multi-modal sentence summarization with modality attention and image filtering*. In Proceedings of the Twenty-Seventh International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence, IJCAI-18, pages 4152â€“4158, 2018.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset details, including the name, description, and citation, ensuring that I have accurately captured all necessary information for each dataset mentioned in the paper.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for further processing or review.
