To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis on Sleep Stage Classification and Sleep Disorder Detection Using Artificial Intelligence" by Tayab Uddin Wara et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets along with their full citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, results, and discussion sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a general overview, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or references to studies that utilized specific datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **results section**, particularly the tables that summarize the datasets used in various studies. For instance, I will examine **Table 2**, which lists sample sizes and datasets used for sleep stage classification, and **Table 3**, which details datasets used for sleep disorder detection. Each entry in these tables typically includes the dataset name and the corresponding reference.

In **Table 2**, I will note the following datasets:

1. **Sleep-EDFX**: Used in multiple studies, including those by Hasan & Koo (2023) and Xu et al. (2023).
2. **Sleep Heart Health Study (SHHS)**: Mentioned in conjunction with other datasets.
3. **MIT-BIH Polysomnographic Database**: Also referenced in the context of sleep stage classification.
4. **Physionet repository**: Frequently cited as a source for various datasets.

In **Table 3**, I will identify datasets related to sleep disorder detection, such as:

1. **CAP Sleep Database**: Used in studies by Fu et al. (2022) and others.
2. **Stanford STAGES Dataset**: Cited in Geng et al. (2023).
3. **Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD)**: Mentioned in the context of sleep disorder studies.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access the datasets.

For example, I will look for the following citations:

- For **Sleep-EDFX**:
  > Sleep-EDF dataset. (2013). PhysioNet. Retrieved from [PhysioNet URL]

- For **CAP Sleep Database**:
  > The CAP Sleep Database. (Year). [Authors]. [Journal/Publisher]. DOI/URL

- For **Stanford STAGES Dataset**:
  > Stanford STAGES dataset. (Year). [Authors]. [Journal/Publisher]. DOI/URL

Once I have gathered all the datasets and their citations, I will compile them into a structured format for easy reference. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research paper along with their full citations, which is essential for any further analysis or replication of the studies discussed in the paper.
