To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Benign Overfitting in Fixed Dimension via Physics-Informed Learning with Smooth Inductive Bias" by Honam Wong et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and it may mention specific datasets used for experiments or evaluations.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **experiments**. In many research papers, authors typically describe the datasets they used in detail in these sections. I will pay attention to any specific names, descriptions, and characteristics of the datasets.

If the paper includes a **results or experiments section**, I will check for any references to datasets used for validation or testing of the proposed methods. This section often contains crucial information about the datasets, including their size, type, and any preprocessing steps taken.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is important for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

For example, if the authors mention using a dataset like the "U-Net Dataset" or "Penn Action Dataset," I will look for the corresponding citation in the references. If the dataset is publicly available, I will also note where it can be accessed.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is clearly documented.

Finally, I will summarize the findings in a structured format, ready for further processing or review.
