To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Federated Learning under Covariate Shifts with Generalization Guarantees" by Ali Ramezani-Kebrya et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. I will look for any specific names of datasets, descriptions of their contents, and any relevant details such as the number of samples or classes.

In the **results section**, I will check for tables or figures that summarize the performance of the proposed methods on the datasets. This may provide additional context about the datasets, including their characteristics and how they were utilized in the experiments.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, if the authors mention using the **CIFAR10 dataset**, I would look for the citation:
> Alex Krizhevsky. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical report, University of Toronto, 2009.

If they mention another dataset, such as **Fashion MNIST**, I would find its citation:
> Xiao, H., Rasul, K., & Vollgraf, R. *Fashion-MNIST: A Novel Image Dataset for Benchmarking Machine Learning Algorithms*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1708.07747, 2017.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant datasets from the paper.
