To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Content Conditional Debiasing for Fair Text Embedding" by Wenlong Deng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of LLMs for data augmentation, which suggests that datasets are involved, but I need to find specific names.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention the challenge of lacking proper training data and refer to the use of datasets labeled with sensitive information. However, I need to look further to find specific datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their evaluations. They mention generating training data with the **News-commentary-v15 corpus** and using several datasets for gender bias evaluation, including:

1. **SEAT**: This dataset is referenced for evaluating gender bias in text embeddings.
2. **CrowS-Pairs**: Another dataset used for measuring social biases in masked language models.
3. **StereoSet-Intrasentence**: This dataset is also mentioned for evaluating biases.
4. **Bias-IR**: A dataset used to assess fairness in longer texts.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **News-commentary-v15 corpus**, the citation is:
  > Jörg Tiedemann. 2012. Parallel data, tools and interfaces in opus. In Lrec, volume 2012, pages 2214–2218. Citeseer.

- For the **SEAT dataset**, the citation is:
  > Chandler May, Alex Wang, Shikha Bordia, Samuel R Bowman, and Rachel Rudinger. 2019. On measuring social biases in sentence encoders. arXiv preprint arXiv:1903.10561.

- For the **CrowS-Pairs dataset**, the citation is:
  > Nikita Nangia, Clara Vania, Rasika Bhalerao, and Samuel R Bowman. 2020. Crows-pairs: A challenge dataset for measuring social biases in masked language models. arXiv preprint arXiv:2010.00133.

- For the **StereoSet-Intrasentence dataset**, the citation is:
  > Moin Nadeem, Anna Bethke, and Siva Reddy. 2020. Stereoset: Measuring stereotypical bias in pretrained language models. arXiv preprint arXiv:2004.09456.

- For the **Bias-IR dataset**, the citation is:

Grep-biasir: A dataset for investigating gender representation bias in information retrieval results. In Proceedings of the 2023 Conference on Human Information Interaction and Retrieval, pages 444–448.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
