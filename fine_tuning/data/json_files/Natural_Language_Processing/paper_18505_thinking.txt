To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CauESC: A Causal Aware Model for Emotional Support Conversation" by Wei Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the experimental results are based on a benchmark dataset, which suggests that there is at least one dataset used in the research.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 5) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they mention the **ESConv dataset** as the primary dataset for their experiments. I will take note of the details provided about this dataset, including its purpose and any relevant statistics mentioned.

The authors provide a brief overview of the **ESConv dataset**, indicating that it was collected with crowdworkers in a seeker and supporter mode, and they present statistics about the dataset, such as the number of dialogues and utterances. This information is crucial for understanding the dataset's scope and application.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the ESConv dataset. The authors reference Liu et al. (2021) for this dataset, which I will need to cite properly.

The citation for the **ESConv dataset** is:
> Siyang Liu, Chujie Zheng, Orianna Demasi, Sahand Sabour, Yu Li, Zhou Yu, Yong Jiang, and Minlie Huang. *Towards emotional support dialog systems*. In Proceedings of the 59th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics and the 11th International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing (Volume 1: Long Papers), pages 3469â€“3483, Online, 2021.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring that I include the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation as required.

In summary, the steps I followed include:
1. Reading the abstract and introduction to identify mentions of datasets.
2. Focusing on the experiments section to find detailed descriptions of the datasets used.
3. Noting the statistics and context of the ESConv dataset.
4. Retrieving the full citation from the references section.

With this structured approach, I can ensure that I accurately extract and cite the datasets used in the research paper.
