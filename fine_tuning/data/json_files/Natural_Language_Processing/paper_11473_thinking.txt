To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Survey on Cross-Architectural IoT Malware Threat Hunting" by Anandharaju Durai Raju et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract and introduction** sections. These sections often provide a high-level overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used in the study. In this case, the abstract discusses the focus on IoT malware detection and classification, which suggests that datasets related to malware may be included.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** within the paper, which is typically where authors describe the datasets they used for their experiments. In this paper, I will specifically check **Section IV (Discussion on Surveyed Papers)**, as it summarizes the research works surveyed and often includes details about the datasets used in those studies.

Upon reviewing Section IV, I find several mentions of datasets used in various studies:

1. **IoTPOT Dataset**: This dataset contains samples compiled for eight different CPU architectures and is referenced in the context of cross-architecture IoT malware signature generation. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Pa, Y. M. P., Suzuki, S., Yoshioka, K., Matsumoto, T., Kasama, T., & Rossow, C. (2015). IoTPOT: Analysing the rise of IoT compromises. In Proc. 9th USENIX Workshop Offensive Technol. (WOOT), 2015, pp. 1â€“9.

2. **VXHeavens Dataset**: This dataset includes 756 benign and 763 malware samples from eight classes, used for Linux malware detection. The citation is:
   > Bai, J., Yang, Y., Mu, S., & Ma, Y. (2013). Malware detection through mining symbol table of Linux executables. Inf. Technol. J., 12(2), 380.

3. **VirusTotal Dataset**: This dataset is mentioned in the context of analyzing malware samples and includes a large number of samples. The citation is:
   > VirusTotal. (n.d.). VirusTotal. [Online]. Available: https://www.virustotal.com

4. **Extended IoT Malware Binary Dataset**: Released by the IoTPOT team, this dataset comprises 173K IoT malware binaries and is noted as a significant resource for future research. The citation is:
   > IoTPOT Team. (2021). Extended IoT malware binary dataset. [Online]. Available: https://sec.ynu.codes/iot/available_datasets

After identifying these datasets, I will ensure to note their descriptions and the context in which they were used in the paper. This will help in providing a comprehensive overview of the datasets relevant to the research.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries along with their full citations into a structured format for easy reference and further analysis. This structured approach ensures that I do not miss any important details and that the citations are accurate and complete.
