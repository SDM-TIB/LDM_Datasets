To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Second-Order NLP Adversarial Examples" by John X. Morris, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions testing on two constraints, the Universal Sentence Encoder (USE) and BERTScore, but does not specify datasets. I will need to look deeper.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the author discusses the datasets used for testing the adversarial attacks. Here, I find three datasets explicitly mentioned:

1. **Stanford Natural Language Inference (SNLI) Corpus**: This dataset contains labeled sentence pairs for textual entailment, which is crucial for evaluating the performance of the proposed adversarial attacks.

2. **Stanford Sentiment Treebank v2 (SST-2)**: This dataset is used for phrase-level sentiment classification, providing another context for testing the adversarial examples.

3. **Rotten Tomatoes (MR) dataset**: This dataset is used for sentence-level sentiment classification and is also referenced in the context of evaluating the adversarial attacks.

In the **appendices**, I will check for any additional details or citations related to these datasets. The references section will be particularly important for obtaining full citations.

Now, I will compile the full citations for each dataset based on the references provided in the paper:

- For the **SNLI Corpus**, the citation is:
  > Samuel R. Bowman, Gabor Angeli, Christopher Potts, and Christopher D. Manning. *A large annotated corpus for learning natural language inference*. In Proceedings of the 2015 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), pages 632–640, 2015.

- For the **SST-2 Corpus**, the citation is:
  > Richard Socher, Alex Perelygin, Jean Wu, Jason Chuang, Christopher D. Manning, Andrew Y. Ng, and Christopher Potts. *Recursive deep models for semantic compositionality over a sentiment treebank*. In Proceedings of the 2013 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), pages 1631–1642, 2013.

- For the **Rotten Tomatoes dataset**, the citation is:
  > Bo Pang and Lillian Lee. *Seeing stars: Exploiting class relationships for sentiment categorization with respect to rating scales*. In Proceedings of the ACL, 2005.

With these citations in hand, I will ensure that each dataset is clearly documented with its respective citation, ready for inclusion in any structured output or further analysis.
