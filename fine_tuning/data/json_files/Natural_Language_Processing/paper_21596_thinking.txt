To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Explainable Light-Weight Deep Learning Pipeline for Improved Drought Stress Identification" by Aswini Kumar Patra and Lingaraj Sahoo, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study utilizes a publicly accessible dataset of potato crop aerial images, which suggests that there is a dataset to extract.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Materials and Methods)**, specifically **subsection 2.1 (Preparing the Data)**, where the authors describe the dataset in detail. They mention that the potato crop aerial images were sourced from a publicly accessible dataset collected at the Aberdeen Research and Extension Center, University of Idaho. This section provides crucial information about the dataset, including the number of images, their resolution, and the method of acquisition.

The authors specify that the dataset comprises **360 RGB image patches** in JPG format, with a training subset of **300 images** and a testing subset of **60 images**. They also mention that ground-truth annotations are provided in XML and CSV formats, indicating regions of healthy and stressed plants.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset mentioned. The authors reference a dataset of multispectral potato plant images from the University of Idaho, which is crucial for proper citation.

The citation for the dataset is:
> A dataset of multispectral potato plants images, University of Idaho. *https://www.webpages.uidaho.edu/vakanski/Multispectral Images Dataset.html*, 2021.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the dataset as it is essential for proper attribution.

In summary, I will extract the following dataset information:
1. **Dataset Name**: Potato Crop Aerial Images Dataset
   - **Description**: A dataset comprising 360 RGB image patches of potato crops, with annotations for healthy and stressed plants.
   - **Citation**: A dataset of multispectral potato plants images, University of Idaho. *https://www.webpages.uidaho.edu/vakanski/Multispectral Images Dataset.html*, 2021.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare it for structured output, ensuring clarity and completeness for future reference or processing.
