To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Meta-Learning Approach for Training Explainable Graph Neural Networks" by Indro Spinelli et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental evaluation sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **experimental evaluation section**, I will look for a subsection specifically dedicated to datasets, as this is where authors typically describe the datasets they used for their experiments. In this paper, the authors mention several synthetic datasets for node classification and one for graph classification.

Next, I will identify the specific datasets mentioned:

1. **BA-shapes**: This dataset is described as generating a base graph with the Barabási-Albert model and attaching a house-like motif. It has four labels based on the structure of the graph.

2. **BA-community**: This dataset consists of two BA-shapes graphs with randomly attached edges and has eight classes determined by the memberships of the graphs.

3. **Tree-cycles**: This dataset features a balanced tree graph with a depth of 8 and includes motifs that are six-node cycles, resulting in two labels.

4. **Tree-grids**: Similar to Tree-cycles, but with a grid of nine nodes as the motif.

5. **BA-2motifs**: This graph classification dataset contains 800 graphs, each with a base component generated by the BA model, and it has two labels based on the motifs injected into the graph.

6. **MUTAG**: A molecular dataset where molecules are represented as graphs, with nodes as atoms and edges as chemical bonds. The labels are based on the mutagenic effects of the molecules.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **BA-shapes** and **BA-community**, the original paper describing the Barabási-Albert model is:
  > R. Albert and A.-L. Barabási. *Statistical mechanics of complex networks*. Rev. Mod. Phys., 74:47–97, Jan 2002.

- For **MUTAG**, the citation is:
  > A.K. Debnath et al. *Structure-activity relationship of mutagenic aromatic and heteroaromatic nitro compounds*. Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, 34(2):786–797, February 1991.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations into a structured format for further processing. This ensures that I have accurately captured all relevant information regarding the datasets used in the research paper.
