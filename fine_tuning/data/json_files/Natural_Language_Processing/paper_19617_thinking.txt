To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Enhancing Quality of Compressed Images by Mitigating Enhancement Bias" by Qunliang Xing et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the enhancement of compressed images and mentions the use of various image compression standards, which may imply the presence of datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically looking for any explicit mentions of datasets used for training or evaluation. In this paper, the authors mention using the **DIV2K dataset** for training and evaluation purposes. I will note down the details provided about this dataset.

In the **experiments section**, the authors also refer to the **Flickr2K dataset** as part of their evaluation metrics. This is another dataset that I need to document.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **DIV2K dataset**, the citation is:
   > Eirikur Agustsson and Radu Timofte. *NTIRE 2017 challenge on single image super-resolution: Dataset and study*. In 2017 IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition workshops, CVPR workshops 2017, Honolulu, HI, USA, July 21-26, 2017, pages 1122–1131.

2. For the **Flickr2K dataset**, the citation is:
   > Radu Timofte, Eirikur Agustsson, Luc Van Gool, Ming-Hsuan Yang, Lei Zhang, Bee Lim, Sanghyun Son, Heewon Kim, Seungjun Nah, Kyoung Mu Lee, Xintao Wang, Yapeng Tian, Ke Yu, Yulun Zhang, Shixiang Wu, Chao Dong, Liang Lin, Yu Qiao, Chen Change Loy, Woong Bae, Jae Jun Yoo, Yoseob Han, Jong Chul Ye, Jae-Seok Choi, Munchurl Kim, Deqing Sun, Yujin Zhang, Xibin Song, Yuchao Dai, Xueying Qin, Xuan-Phung Huynh, Tiantong Guo, Hojjat Seyed Mousavi, Tiep Huu Vu, Vishal Monga, Cristóvão Cruz, Karen O. Egiazarian, Vladimir Katkovnik, Rakesh Mehta, Arnav Kumar Jain, Abhinav Agarwalla, Ch V. Sai Praveen, Ruofan Zhou, Hongdiao Wen, Che Zhu, Zhiqiang Xia, Zhengtao Wang, and Qi Guo. *NTIRE 2017 challenge on single image super-resolution: Methods and results*. In 2017 IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition workshops, CVPR workshops 2017, Honolulu, HI, USA, July 21-26, 2017, pages 1110–1121.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
