To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Mining of Single-Class by Active Learning for Semantic Segmentation" by Hugues Lambert and Emma Slade, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly referenced. The abstract mentions the use of the **COCO10k dataset**, which is a strong indication that this dataset is central to the research.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **methodology section**. In this section, the authors describe how they leverage the **COCO10k dataset** for their experiments. They mention that the dataset is used to select image patches for training a semantic segmentation model, which confirms its relevance.

I will also check the **results and discussion sections** to see if any additional datasets are mentioned or if there are any details about the COCO10k dataset that need to be captured. The authors discuss the performance of their method on various classes within the COCO10k dataset, but they do not introduce any new datasets.

Now, I will consult the **references section** to find the full citation for the COCO10k dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Holger Caesar, Jasper Uijlings, and Vittorio Ferrari. *Coco-stuff: Thing and stuff classes in context*. In Proceedings of the IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pages 1209â€“1218, 2018.

Since the paper primarily focuses on the COCO10k dataset, I will create a structured entry for this dataset, ensuring to include the full citation as required.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format that is ready for review or further processing.
