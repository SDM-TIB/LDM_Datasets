To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Mamba-based Light Field Super-Resolution with Efficient Subspace Scanning" by Ruisheng Gao, Zeyu Xiao, and Zhiwei Xiong, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research but may not specify datasets. The introduction often discusses the context and may mention datasets used in prior work or the current study.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically detail the datasets used for training and evaluation. In this section, the authors mention using the **BasicLFSR benchmark**, which comprises five light field datasets: **HCI-new, HCI-old, EPFL, INRIA, and STFGantry**. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for the experiments conducted in the paper.

I will then look for the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is important for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. 

The citations I need to extract are as follows:

1. **HCI-new Dataset**: 
   > Honauer, K., Johannsen, O., Kondermann, D., & Goldluecke, B. (2017). A dataset and evaluation methodology for depth estimation on 4D light fields. In Computer Vision–ACCV 2016: 13th Asian Conference on Computer Vision, Taipei, Taiwan, November 20-24, 2016, Revised Selected Papers, Part III (pp. 19–34). Springer.

2. **HCI-old Dataset**: 
   > Wanner, S., & Meister, S. (2013). Datasets and benchmarks for densely sampled 4D light fields. In VMV (Vol. 13, pp. 225–226).

3. **EPFL Dataset**: 
   > Rerabek, M., & Ebrahimi, T. (2016). New light field image dataset. In 8th International Conference on Quality of Multimedia Experience (QoMEX).

4. **INRIA Dataset**: 
   > Bishop, T.E., & Favaro, P. (2011). The light field camera: Extended depth of field, aliasing, and superresolution. IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 34(5), 972–986.

5. **STFGantry Dataset**: 
   > Vaish, V., & Adams, A. (2008). The (new) Stanford light field archive. Computer Graphics Laboratory, Stanford University, 6(7).

After gathering the dataset names and their respective citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly presents each dataset along with its citation. This will ensure that the datasets are properly documented and can be referenced by others in future research.
