To extract datasets from the research paper titled "FloCoDe: Unbiased Dynamic Scene Graph Generation with Temporal Consistency and Correlation Debiasing" by Anant Khandelwal, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention key datasets used for evaluation.

In the **introduction**, I will look for any statements that indicate the datasets utilized in the study. The authors often discuss the relevance of specific datasets to their research problem, which can provide clues about the datasets they used.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly looking for a subsection that explicitly discusses the datasets. This section typically contains detailed information about the datasets, including their characteristics, sizes, and any relevant splits used for training and testing.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention using the **Action Genome** dataset for their experiments. In the experiments section, they provide specific details about this dataset, including the number of bounding boxes, object classes, and instances of predicate classes.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citation for the Action Genome dataset. The citation is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the dataset.

The full citation for the Action Genome dataset is:
> Jingwei Ji, Ranjay Krishna, Li Fei-Fei, and Juan Carlos Niebles. *Action Genome: Actions as Compositions of Spatio-Temporal Scene Graphs*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 10236â€“10247, 2020.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring that I include the full citation as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the dataset used in the research paper.
