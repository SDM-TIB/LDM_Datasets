To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Distributed Linear Regression with Compositional Covariates" by Yue Chao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the focus on distributed statistical methodology and mentions numerical experiments on both synthetic and real data, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will look for specific sections that typically contain dataset information, such as **section 5 (Numerical Experiments)**, where the authors describe their experiments. Here, they mention using a **synthetic dataset** generated from a multivariate normal distribution and a **real dataset** from a medical insurance dataset for major chest surgeries.

1. **Synthetic Dataset**: The authors describe generating synthetic data based on a regression model with compositional covariates. They mention that the covariate matrix is derived from a multivariate normal distribution, but they do not provide a specific citation for this dataset since it is generated for the purpose of the study.

2. **Medical Insurance Dataset**: The authors provide detailed information about this dataset, which contains information about patients who underwent major chest surgery. They specify that the dataset is collected from a large tertiary hospital in Sichuan Province, China, and is available upon reasonable request. However, they do not provide a formal citation for this dataset either.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to see if there are any citations related to the datasets mentioned. Since the synthetic dataset is generated and the medical insurance dataset is not formally published, there may not be specific citations available.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring to note that the synthetic dataset does not have a citation, while the medical insurance dataset is described but lacks a formal reference. I will document this information clearly, emphasizing the lack of citations for the synthetic dataset and the availability of the medical insurance dataset upon request.

In summary, I will extract the following datasets:
- **Synthetic Dataset**: Generated for the study, no citation available.
- **Medical Insurance Dataset**: Collected from a tertiary hospital in Sichuan Province, China; available upon request, no formal citation provided.

This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture the datasets discussed in the paper while adhering to the importance of citation where applicable.
