To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Dynamic Path-Controllable Deep Unfolding Network for Compressive Sensing" by Jiechong Song et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention any datasets used for evaluation. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the research, which may include references to specific datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **experiments**. In this paper, the authors likely describe the datasets used for their experiments in detail. I will focus on sections that discuss the methodology and experimental setup, as these sections typically contain explicit mentions of datasets.

While reading through these sections, I will take note of any datasets mentioned, including their names, descriptions, and any relevant statistics (such as the number of samples, types of data, etc.). If the authors provide any specific details about how the datasets were used in their experiments, I will also document that information.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial, as proper citation is necessary for academic integrity and for others to locate the datasets.

For example, if the authors mention using the **Set11 dataset** for their experiments, I will look for the corresponding citation in the references. The citation might look something like this:
> K. Kulkarni, S. Lohit, P. Turaga, R. Kerviche, and A. Ashok. *ReconNet: Non-iterative reconstruction of images from compressively sensed measurements*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), Jun. 2016, pp. 449â€“458.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference.

Finally, I will ensure that I have accurately captured all relevant details and citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper, ready for any further processing or review.
