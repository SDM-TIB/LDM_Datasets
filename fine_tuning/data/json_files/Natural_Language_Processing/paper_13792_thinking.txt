To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Gromov-Hausdorff Distances for Comparing Product Manifolds of Model Spaces" by Haitz SÃ¡ez de Ocariz Borde et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly referenced. The abstract provides a high-level overview, but I will need to look deeper into the sections that discuss experiments or methodologies to find specific datasets.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the use of various geometrical concepts in machine learning but do not mention specific datasets. I will then move to the **methodology** section, where they describe their approach to estimating Gromov-Hausdorff distances. Here, they mention the need to discretize model spaces and generate points within these spaces, but again, no specific datasets are cited.

Next, I will check the **results section** where they present estimated Gromov-Hausdorff distances. They refer to various model spaces (Euclidean, hyperbolic, and spherical) but do not provide any datasets used for training or testing.

After thoroughly reviewing the paper, it appears that the authors do not explicitly mention any datasets used in their experiments. Instead, they focus on theoretical constructs and computational methods without referencing specific empirical datasets.

Since no datasets are identified in the paper, I will not be able to provide full citations for datasets as there are none to extract. However, I will ensure to document this finding clearly in my output.

In conclusion, I will summarize that the paper does not contain any datasets, and therefore, there are no citations to provide. This will be noted in my final output.
