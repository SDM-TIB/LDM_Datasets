To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Efficient Computation of Predictive Probabilities in Probit Models via Expectation Propagation" by Augusto Fasano et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract discusses binary regression models and Bayesian inference but does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine the **simulation study section** (Section 4) closely, as this is often where datasets used for experiments are described. In this section, the authors mention conducting a simulation study with synthetic data, but they do not specify any real-world datasets. This indicates that the authors may not have used any publicly available datasets for their experiments.

Since the paper does not reference any specific datasets, I will check the **References section** to see if any datasets are cited indirectly through the works of others. The references include several papers, but they primarily focus on methodologies and theoretical frameworks rather than datasets.

After reviewing the entire paper, it appears that there are no datasets explicitly mentioned or utilized in the research. The authors conducted their experiments using synthetic data, which does not require a citation as it is not a publicly available dataset.

In conclusion, since there are no datasets to extract from this paper, I will note that the authors did not utilize any specific datasets for their experiments, and therefore, there are no citations to provide. This is an important finding as it highlights the reliance on synthetic data in their study.

Overall, I will summarize my findings, noting the absence of datasets and the focus on synthetic data in the research.
