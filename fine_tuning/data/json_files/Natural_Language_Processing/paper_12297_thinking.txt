To extract datasets from the research paper titled "3Deformer: A Common Framework for Image-Guided Mesh Deformation" by Hao Su et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and method sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the framework's capabilities but does not explicitly mention any datasets. However, the introduction provides context about the limitations of existing methods that rely on high-cost 3D training datasets, suggesting that datasets may be discussed later.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** to see if any datasets are explicitly referenced. The authors mention that their method is applicable to editing various object categories and can produce high-quality 3D shapes without relying on specific training datasets. This indicates that they may not use traditional datasets but rather rely on readily available semantic images.

I will also check the **related work section** for any references to datasets used in previous studies. The authors cite several works that involve 3D shape deformation and reconstruction, which may include datasets relevant to their research.

In the **conclusion**, the authors summarize their contributions and reiterate the non-training nature of their framework, emphasizing that it does not depend on specific datasets. This reinforces the idea that they may not provide traditional datasets but rather a methodology that can work with various inputs.

Finally, I will look at the **references section** to identify any datasets that may have been cited indirectly through the works referenced. For instance, they mention ShapeNet, which is a well-known dataset in the field of 3D modeling.

The full citation for ShapeNet is:
> Angel X. Chang, Thomas Funkhouser, Leonidas Guibas, Pat Hanrahan, Qixing Huang, Zimo Li, Silvio Savarese, Manolis Savva, Shuran Song, Hao Su, et al. *ShapeNet: An Information-Rich 3D Model Repository*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1512.03012, 2015.

Since the paper does not provide specific datasets used for experiments, I will note that the authors emphasize the flexibility of their framework to work with various semantic images rather than fixed datasets.

In summary, I will compile the findings and citations into a structured format, ensuring that I include the relevant citations for any datasets mentioned or implied in the paper.
