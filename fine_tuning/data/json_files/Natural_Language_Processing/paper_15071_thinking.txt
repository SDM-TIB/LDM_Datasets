To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Effective and Efficient Federated Tree Learning on Hybrid Data" by Qinbin Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to gather initial insights about the datasets used. The abstract mentions experiments conducted on **simulated and natural hybrid federated datasets**, which indicates that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Evaluation)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention four datasets:

1. **PETs Prize Challenge Datasets**: These datasets contain synthetic transaction data provided by a payment network system (the host) and account data provided by multiple banks (the guests). The authors specify that these datasets are used for anomalous transaction detection.

2. **Adult Dataset**: This is a well-known dataset used for classification tasks, which has been partitioned into subsets for the federated learning scenario.

3. **Cod-rna Dataset**: Another commonly used dataset for classification tasks, which has also been partitioned similarly to the Adult dataset.

4. **DEV-AD Dataset**: This dataset is a variant of the Adult dataset, specifically designed for the experiments in this paper.

In the **appendices**, the authors provide additional details about the datasets, including their statistics and how they were created. This information is crucial for accurately documenting the datasets.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **PETs Prize Challenge Datasets**, the citation is:
  > DrivenData. *U.S. Pets Prize Challenge: Phase 1*. URL: https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/98/nist-federated-learning-1/page/524/.

- For the **Adult Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Dua, D. and Graff, C. *UCI Machine Learning Repository: Adult Dataset*. URL: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/adult.

- For the **Cod-rna Dataset**, the citation is:
  > D. H. Wolpert. *The Cod-rna Dataset*. URL: https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvmtools/datasets/.

- For the **DEV-AD Dataset**, the citation is:
  > The authors did not provide a specific citation for this dataset, but it is a variant of the Adult dataset used in their experiments.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will facilitate further analysis or integration into other systems.
