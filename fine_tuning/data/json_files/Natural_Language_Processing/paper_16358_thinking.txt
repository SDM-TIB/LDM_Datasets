To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Work In Progress: Towards Adaptive RF Fingerprint-based Authentication of IIoT devices" by Emmanuel Lomba et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and design and implementation sections** to look for any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the development of an automated RF feature extraction framework, which suggests that datasets may be involved in the process of feature extraction.

Next, I will focus on the **design and implementation section**, where the authors describe a "Dataset Building System." This section outlines the components involved in creating datasets, specifically mentioning the receiving part (RX block) responsible for digitizing radio signals and storing samples. This indicates that a dataset is being generated as part of their research.

I will also look for any specific names or descriptions of datasets within the text. The authors mention that the resulting dataset will be publicly released in the future, but they do not provide a specific name or citation for it in the current paper. However, they do refer to the use of various SDR hardware and the GNU Radio ecosystem for dataset creation, which implies that the dataset will be related to RF signals collected from these devices.

Since the paper does not provide a full citation for the dataset, I will note that the dataset is still in progress and will be released in the future. I will also mention the tools and technologies used to create the dataset, such as the GNU Radio framework and the specific SDR hardware mentioned (e.g., RTL-SDR, ADALM-Pluto, HackRF One).

Finally, I will summarize my findings regarding the dataset, including the context in which it is being developed and the technologies involved, while noting the lack of a formal citation at this time.

In conclusion, I will prepare a structured output that captures the details of the dataset as described in the paper, while acknowledging that the full citation will be available upon the dataset's release.
