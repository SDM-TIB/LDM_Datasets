To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Physics-Informed Nonlinear Vector Autoregressive Models for the Prediction of Dynamical Systems" by James H. Adler et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and numerical experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and while it may not list datasets directly, it can hint at their existence.

Next, I will focus on the **numerical experiments section (Section 4)**, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for testing their models. In this section, the authors mention three ordinary differential equations (ODEs) that they use for their experiments:

1. **Undamped Spring**: The authors describe the undamped spring equation and provide its exact solution. They also mention generating numerical solutions using the RK4 scheme.

2. **Lotka-Volterra**: This is a nonlinear first-order system used to describe population dynamics. The authors specify the parameters and the initial conditions for the model.

3. **Lorenz System**: The authors describe the chaotic Lorenz system and provide the initial conditions and the method used to generate approximate numerical solutions.

I will then check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets or models referenced in the paper. However, in this case, the datasets are derived from well-known mathematical models rather than external datasets, so I will focus on citing the original sources of these models.

For the **Undamped Spring**, the original equation can be cited as:
> Blanchard, P., Devaney, R. L., & Hall, G. R. (2006). *Differential Equations*. Thomson Brooks/Cole.

For the **Lotka-Volterra equations**, I can reference:
> Lotka, A. J. (1925). *Elements of Physical Biology*. Williams & Wilkins.

For the **Lorenz system**, the citation is:
> Lorenz, E. N. (1963). Deterministic nonperiodic flow. *Journal of the Atmospheric Sciences*, 20(2), 130-141. https://doi.org/10.1175/1520-0469(1963)020<0130:DNF>2.0.CO;2.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, along with their full citations for reference.
