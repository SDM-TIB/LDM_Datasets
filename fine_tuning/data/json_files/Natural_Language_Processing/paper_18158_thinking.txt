To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An Effective Index for Truss-based Community Search on Large Directed Graphs" by Wei Ai et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, but I will need to delve deeper into the body of the paper for specific dataset details.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss community search in directed graphs and mention the need for efficient methods. However, they do not explicitly name any datasets here. I will continue to the **experiments section**, which is likely to contain the dataset information.

In **section IV (Experiment)**, the authors state that they utilized four real-world datasets consisting of directed networks: **EAT, Slashdot, Twitter, and Pokec**. They provide statistical information about these datasets in **Table II**, which includes the number of vertices and edges, maximum degrees, and other relevant metrics.

Next, I will extract the details of each dataset:

1. **EAT**: A word association network with 23.1K vertices and 685K edges.
2. **Slashdot**: A social relationship network with 77.4K vertices and 905.5K edges.
3. **Twitter**: Another social relationship network with 81.3K vertices and 1.8M edges.
4. **Pokec**: A social network with 1.6M vertices and 30.6M edges.

Now, I will look for the full citations for these datasets in the **References section**. However, the paper does not provide explicit citations for these datasets, so I will need to rely on existing knowledge or common sources for these datasets:

- **EAT**: The dataset is often referenced in the context of word association tasks, but a specific citation may not be readily available.
- **Slashdot**: This dataset is commonly cited in social network analysis literature. A typical citation might be:
  > Leskovec, J., Adamic, L. A., & Huberman, B. A. (2007). The dynamics of viral marketing. *ACM Transactions on the Web (TWEB)*, 1(1), 5.
  
- **Twitter**: The Twitter dataset is widely used in various studies, and a common reference is:
  > Kwak, H., Lee, C., Park, H., & Moon, S. (2010). What is Twitter, a social network or a news media? *Proceedings of the 19th International Conference on World Wide Web*, 591-600.
  
- **Pokec**: This dataset is often cited in social network research, and a reference could be:
  > Leskovec, J., & Krevl, A. (2014). SNAP Datasets: Stanford Large Network Dataset Collection. *http://snap.stanford.edu/data*.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
