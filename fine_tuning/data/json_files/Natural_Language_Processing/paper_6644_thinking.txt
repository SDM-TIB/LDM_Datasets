To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Pragmatic Clinical Trials in the Rubric of Structural Causal Models" by Riddhiman Adib et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract and introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors leverage an experimental dataset from a pragmatic clinical trial, which suggests that there is at least one dataset to extract.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **methods and results sections**. In the methods section, the authors describe their approach and mention using a hypothetical pragmatic clinical trial dataset discussed in a reference (McCoy, 2017). This indicates that I need to look for details about this dataset.

In the **example section**, the authors provide a detailed description of the hypothetical pragmatic clinical trial dataset. They mention that the dataset includes 200 patients, with specific treatment protocols and outcomes related to cardiovascular disease. This is crucial information that I need to capture.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the dataset mentioned. The reference for the dataset is:

- For the dataset from the hypothetical pragmatic clinical trial, the citation is:
  > Eric McCoy. *Understanding the intention-to-treat principle in randomized controlled trials*. Western Journal of Emergency Medicine, 18(6):1075, 2017.

Since this is the only dataset explicitly mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the dataset.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for review, ensuring that it is clear and complete, ready for any further processing or analysis.
