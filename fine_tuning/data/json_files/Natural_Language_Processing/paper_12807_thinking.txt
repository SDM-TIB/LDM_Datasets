To extract datasets from the research paper titled "mSigSDK - private, at scale, computation of mutation signatures" by Aaron Ge et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the development of the mSigSDK and its connection to the mSig Portal, which suggests that there may be datasets associated with these resources.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors discuss mutational signatures and their relevance to cancer research. They mention the mSigPortal, which is a web-based platform that provides access to curated mutational signature databases. This indicates that there are datasets available through this portal.

In the **methods section**, the authors describe how the mSigSDK interacts with the mSigPortal APIs. They mention that users can explore curated mutational signature databases and perform analyses, which implies that there are specific datasets being utilized, although they may not be explicitly named yet.

I will then look for any specific datasets mentioned in the **results section** or any figures that might reference datasets. The paper discusses various visualizations and analyses related to mutational signatures, but I need to confirm if any datasets are explicitly named.

Upon reviewing the **citations**, I notice that the authors reference several studies and databases that may contain relevant datasets. For example, they mention the COSMIC database, which is known for its comprehensive collection of cancer mutation data.

Now, I will compile the information I have gathered about the datasets:

1. **mSigPortal**: This is a platform developed by the National Cancer Institute that provides access to curated mutational signature databases. While the paper does not provide a specific dataset name, it indicates that the portal contains multiple datasets related to mutational signatures.

2. **COSMIC Database**: The authors mention the COSMIC v3 Signatures, which are used for reference in their analyses. This database is a well-known resource for cancer mutation data.

Next, I will retrieve the full citations for these datasets from the references section:

- For **mSigPortal**, the citation is:
  > Zhang, T., et al. (2023). mSigPortal: A web-based platform for mutational signature analysis. National Cancer Institute. Available at: https://analysistools.cancer.gov/mutational-signatures/#/

- For **COSMIC Database**, the citation is:
  > Tate, J. G., et al. (2019). COSMIC: The Catalogue Of Somatic Mutations In Cancer. *Nucleic Acids Research*, 47(D1), D941-D947. https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gky1015

Finally, I will summarize the datasets and their citations in a structured format for further processing. This will ensure that all relevant information is captured accurately and can be utilized effectively.
