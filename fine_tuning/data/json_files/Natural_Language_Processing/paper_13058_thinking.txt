To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Expressivity of Graph Neural Networks Through the Lens of Adversarial Robustness" by Francesco Campi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract discusses the study of adversarial robustness in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and mentions the use of synthetic datasets for experiments. This indicates that there are datasets involved, but I need to find specific names and details.

Next, I will look into **section 6 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention generating a synthetic dataset of **5,000 Stochastic-Block-Model graphs** with specific characteristics. This is a clear indication of a dataset that has been created for the purpose of their study.

In the same section, they also refer to **Erdos-Renyi graphs** as another dataset used for out-of-distribution (OOD) experiments. This is important as it highlights the diversity of datasets utilized in their research.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. However, since the synthetic dataset is generated by the authors, it may not have a formal citation. For the **Erdos-Renyi graphs**, I will look for any relevant papers that describe this type of graph, but it is a well-known model in graph theory and may not have a specific citation in this context.

The citation for the Stochastic-Block-Model graphs is not explicitly provided, as it is a dataset created for the study. However, I can note that it is based on the methodology described in the paper.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the names, descriptions, and any relevant citations, even if they are not formal references.

The datasets I will document are:

1. **Stochastic-Block-Model graphs**: A synthetic dataset consisting of 5,000 graphs with 30 nodes divided into 3 communities, used for evaluating the expressivity of GNNs.
   
2. **Erdos-Renyi graphs**: A dataset used for out-of-distribution experiments, generated with specific edge probabilities.

Now, I will prepare to format this information into the required structure for further processing or review.
