To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-SimLex: A Large-Scale Evaluation of Multilingual and Cross-Lingual Lexical Semantic Similarity" by Ivan Vulic et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the creation of **Multi-SimLex**, which is a large-scale lexical resource covering datasets for 12 languages. This indicates that there are multiple datasets involved, and I should look for their specific names and details.

Next, I will examine the **methodology sections**, particularly where the authors describe the dataset creation process. In the introduction, they mention that each language dataset contains 1,888 semantically aligned concept pairs. This suggests that there is a primary dataset for each language, which I need to identify.

I will then look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **results or experiments sections**. The paper outlines that they provide datasets for 12 languages, including major languages like Mandarin Chinese and Spanish, as well as less-resourced languages like Welsh and Kiswahili. I will note down the names of these datasets.

In the **contributions section**, the authors summarize their main contributions, which include the release of manually annotated evaluation sets across 12 languages and 66 cross-lingual evaluation sets. This indicates that there are both monolingual and cross-lingual datasets to consider.

Next, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper references various sources for the datasets, including prior works that may have established the datasets or provided methodologies for their creation.

Based on the information gathered, I will compile the datasets as follows:

1. **Multi-SimLex English Dataset**: Contains 1,888 concept pairs for English.
   - Citation: Vulic, I., Ponti, E. M., et al. (2020). Multi-SimLex: A Large-Scale Evaluation of Multilingual and Cross-Lingual Lexical Semantic Similarity. *Journal Name*, Volume 1, Number 1.

2. **Multi-SimLex Mandarin Dataset**: Contains 1,888 concept pairs for Mandarin Chinese.
   - Citation: Vulic, I., Ponti, E. M., et al. (2020). Multi-SimLex: A Large-Scale Evaluation of Multilingual and Cross-Lingual Lexical Semantic Similarity. *Journal Name*, Volume 1, Number 1.

3. **Multi-SimLex Spanish Dataset**: Contains 1,888 concept pairs for Spanish.
   - Citation: Vulic, I., Ponti, E. M., et al. (2020). Multi-SimLex: A Large-Scale Evaluation of Multilingual and Cross-Lingual Lexical Semantic Similarity. *Journal Name*, Volume 1, Number 1.

4. **Multi-SimLex Welsh Dataset**: Contains 1,888 concept pairs for Welsh.
   - Citation: Vulic, I., Ponti, E. M., et al. (2020). Multi-SimLex: A Large-Scale Evaluation of Multilingual and Cross-Lingual Lexical Semantic Similarity. *Journal Name*, Volume 1, Number 1.

5. **Multi-SimLex Kiswahili Dataset**: Contains 1,888 concept pairs for Kiswahili.
   - Citation: Vulic, I., Ponti, E. M., et al. (2020). Multi-SimLex: A Large-Scale Evaluation of Multilingual and Cross-Lingual Lexical Semantic Similarity. *Journal Name*, Volume 1, Number 1.

6. **Cross-Lingual Multi-SimLex Datasets**: 66 datasets created from the monolingual datasets.
   - Citation: Vulic, I., Ponti, E. M., et al. (2020). Multi-SimLex: A Large-Scale Evaluation of Multilingual and Cross-Lingual Lexical Semantic Similarity. *Journal Name*, Volume 1, Number 1.

After gathering all this information, I will ensure that I have the correct citations formatted properly for each dataset. This structured approach will help me accurately extract and document the datasets from the paper.
