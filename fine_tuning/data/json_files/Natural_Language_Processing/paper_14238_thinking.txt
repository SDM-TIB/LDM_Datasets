To extract datasets from the research paper titled "PLMM: Personal Large Language Models on Mobile Devices" by Yuanhao Gong, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly referenced. The abstract discusses the development of personal large models but does not mention specific datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine the **sections that discuss experiments or methodologies**. In this paper, there is no dedicated section labeled "Datasets," but I will look for any mentions of datasets in the context of training or evaluating the models. I will pay close attention to any tables or figures that might summarize data sources or datasets used.

As I read through the paper, I will note any references to datasets, including their names, descriptions, and the context in which they are used. If the paper mentions any datasets indirectly, I will ensure to capture that information as well.

After identifying potential datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets.

If the paper refers to well-known datasets (like those used in natural language processing or machine learning), I will ensure to include their standard citations. If the datasets are novel or specific to the study, I will document the citation provided by the authors.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each entry is clear and accurately reflects the content of the paper.

By following these steps, I will ensure a thorough extraction of datasets from the paper while maintaining the integrity of the citations.
