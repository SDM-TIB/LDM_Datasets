To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Initial Decoding with Minimally Augmented Language Model for Improved Lattice Rescoring in Low Resource ASR" by Savitha Murthy and Dinkar Sitaram, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and datasets section** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, and the introduction elaborates on the context and significance of the study. I will pay special attention to any references to datasets used for experiments.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Datasets and Experimental Setup)**, which is likely to contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the experiments. Here, the authors mention two specific datasets:

1. **Telugu Speech Corpus**: Released by Microsoft as part of the "Speech Recognition for Indian Languages Challenge" by Srivastava et al. at Interspeech, 2018. This dataset consists of 40 hours of read and conversational speech, with a vocabulary of 43,260 words and an OOV rate of 12.04%.

2. **Kannada Speech Corpus**: Recorded using transcripts from a speech synthesis dataset from IIIT Hyderabad. This dataset contains 4 hours of speech, with a baseline vocabulary of 1,754 words and an OOV rate of 25.22%.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. The citations I need to extract are:

- For the **Telugu Speech Corpus**:
  > Srivastava, B. M. L., Sitaram, S., Mehta, R. K., Mohan, K. D., Matani, P., Satpal, S. K., Bali, K., Srikanth, R., & Nayak, N. (2018). Interspeech 2018 low resource automatic speech recognition challenge for Indian languages. In SLTU, pages 11â€“14.

- For the **Kannada Speech Corpus**:
  > IIIT Hyderabad. (2017). Speech synthesis dataset. Retrieved from http://festvox.org/databases/iiit-voices.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research, along with their respective references for further validation and exploration.
