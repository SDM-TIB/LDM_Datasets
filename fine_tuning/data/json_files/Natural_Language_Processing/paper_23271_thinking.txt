To extract datasets from the research paper titled "S4Fusion: Saliency-aware Selective State Space Model for Infrared Visible Image Fusion" by Haolong Ma et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the integration of information from different modalities, which suggests that datasets related to infrared and visible images might be involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for validation and testing. In this paper, the authors mention that they amalgamated the training sets of **MSRS**, **M3FD**, and **RoadScene** datasets to create a diversified dataset for training. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for their experiments.

I will then look for specific details about each dataset in the **experiments section** and **appendix**. The authors provide quantitative comparisons on the **MSRS** and **RoadScene** datasets, which confirms their use in the experiments. They also mention the **M3FD** dataset in the context of multi-modality object detection tasks.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset from the **References section**:

1. **MSRS Dataset**: The citation is:
   > J. Liu, X. Fan, Z. Huang, G. Wu, R. Liu, W. Zhong, and Z. Luo. *Target-aware dual adversarial learning and a multi-scenario multi-modality benchmark to fuse infrared and visible for object detection*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 5802–5811, 2022.

2. **M3FD Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Z. Zhao, H. Bai, Y. Zhu, J. Zhang, S. Xu, Y. Zhang, K. Zhang, D. Meng, R. Timofte, and L. Van Gool. *DDFM: Denoising diffusion model for multi-modality image fusion*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision, pages 8082–8093, 2023.

3. **RoadScene Dataset**: The citation is:
   > H. Xu, J. Ma, J. Jiang, Z. Le, and X. Guo. *FusionDN: A unified densely connected network for image fusion*. In Proceedings of the Thirty-Fourth AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI), pages 12484–12491, 2020.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented and properly cited.
