To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Breaking the Trilemma of Privacy, Utility, and Efficiency via Controllable Machine Unlearning" by Zheyuan Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions "comprehensive experiments on various benchmark datasets," which indicates that datasets are used, but I need to find their specific names.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any explicit mentions of datasets. The authors discuss the importance of machine learning models trained on real-world datasets, but I need to look for specific dataset names.

In the **experiments section**, the authors detail their experimental setup, including the datasets used. They mention using **CIFAR-10**, **CIFAR-100**, and **SVHN** datasets for their experiments. This is a crucial finding as it identifies the datasets utilized in their research.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **CIFAR-10**:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton, et al. 2009. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. (2009).

- For **CIFAR-100**:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton, et al. 2009. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. (2009).

- For **SVHN**:
  > Yuval Netzer, Tao Wang, Adam Coates, Alessandro Bissacco, Bo Wu, and A Ng. 2018. *The street view house numbers (SVHN) dataset*. Technical Report. Technical report, Accessed 2016-08-01.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use. Each dataset will be documented with its name, description, and full citation to ensure clarity and completeness.
