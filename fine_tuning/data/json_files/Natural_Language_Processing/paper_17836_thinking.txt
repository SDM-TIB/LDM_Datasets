To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "HALTINGVT: ADAPTIVE TOKEN HALTING TRANSFORMER FOR EFFICIENT VIDEO RECOGNITION" by Qian Wu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant details, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors achieved results on the **Mini-Kinetics dataset**, which indicates that this dataset is likely used in their experiments.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for evaluation. They mention two datasets:

1. **Mini-Kinetics**: This dataset is described as a subset of the larger Kinetics dataset, containing 200 action categories with 121K training videos and 10K testing videos. Each video lasts between 6 to 10 seconds.

2. **ActivityNet-v1.3**: This dataset is noted for multi-label action recognition tasks, comprising 200 human activity categories, with 10,024 training videos and 4,926 validation videos. The average video duration is significantly longer, at 117 seconds, making it a more challenging dataset.

To confirm the details and obtain the full citations, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **Mini-Kinetics**, the citation is:
  > Will Kay, Joao Carreira, Karen Simonyan, Brian Zhang, Chloe Hillier, Sudheendra Vijayanarasimhan, Fabio Viola, Tim Green, Trevor Back, Paul Natsev, et al. *The kinetics human action video dataset*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1705.06950, 2017.

- For **ActivityNet-v1.3**, the citation is:
  > Fabian Caba Heilbron, Victor Escorcia, Bernard Ghanem, and Juan Carlos Niebles. *Activitynet: A large-scale video benchmark for human activity understanding*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 961â€“970, 2015.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their full citations, I will prepare to compile this information into the required format for further processing or review.
