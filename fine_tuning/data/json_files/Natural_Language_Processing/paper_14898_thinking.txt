To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Advancing Perception in Artificial Intelligence through Principles of Cognitive Science" by Palaash Agrawal, Cheston Tan, and Heena Rathore, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections that discuss methodologies and experiments** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a general overview, but I will need to look for specific mentions of datasets in the body of the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **background and contributions sections** to see if the authors reference any datasets used in their analysis or comparisons. If they mention any datasets, I will take note of their names and descriptions.

I will also check the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. This is crucial, as proper citation is essential for academic integrity and allows others to locate the datasets.

If the paper discusses any specific datasets used for experiments or comparisons, I will summarize the key details about each dataset, including:

1. **Name of the dataset**: The exact title as mentioned in the paper.
2. **Description**: A brief overview of what the dataset contains, its purpose, and any relevant statistics (e.g., number of samples, types of data).
3. **Full citation**: The complete reference for the dataset, including authors, title, publication venue, and year.

After gathering this information, I will ensure that I have accurately captured all relevant datasets and their citations. This will involve cross-referencing with the references section to ensure that I have the correct details.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format for easy access and review, ensuring that each dataset is clearly identified and properly cited.
