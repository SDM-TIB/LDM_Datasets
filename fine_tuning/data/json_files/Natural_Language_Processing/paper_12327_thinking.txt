To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards an architectural framework for intelligent virtual agents using probabilistic programming" by Anton Andreev and Gr√©goire Cattan, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the framework, but it may not contain specific dataset information. The introduction may reference existing datasets used in the context of embodied conversational agents (ECAs) or related research.

Next, I will look for a **dedicated section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments or evaluation sections**. If the authors describe experiments involving specific datasets, I will note their names and any relevant details about their content, size, and purpose.

I will also check the **references section** for any citations related to datasets. This is crucial as it will provide the full citation needed for each dataset mentioned in the paper.

If the paper discusses specific datasets, I will summarize the key details for each dataset, including:

1. **Dataset Name**: The official name of the dataset.
2. **Description**: A brief description of what the dataset contains and its purpose.
3. **Citation**: The full citation for the dataset as it appears in the references.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like "KANOPEE" used for managing sleep disorders, I would extract the following information:

- **Dataset Name**: KANOPEE
- **Description**: A smartphone-based virtual agent used to manage sleep disorders.
- **Citation**: Philip P, Dupuy L, Morin CM, et al. *Smartphone-Based Virtual Agents to Help Individuals With Sleep Concerns During COVID-19 Confinement: Feasibility Study*. J Med Internet Res. 2020;22(12):e24268.

After gathering all relevant datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference.

Finally, I will ensure that all extracted datasets are accurately represented and that their citations are complete and correctly formatted according to the style used in the paper.
