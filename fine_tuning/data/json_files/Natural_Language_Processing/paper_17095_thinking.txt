To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Optimal Information Acquisition Under Intervention" by Augusto Nieto-Barthaburu, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract, introduction, and sections that discuss methodology and experiments**. The abstract provides a concise overview of the research, but it may not explicitly mention datasets. Therefore, I will pay close attention to the introduction and subsequent sections where the authors might describe their methodology or empirical analysis.

In the **introduction**, I will look for any references to datasets used in the analysis or examples that might indicate the use of specific datasets. The introduction often sets the stage for the research and may mention relevant datasets or studies that utilize them.

Next, I will examine the **methodology or analysis sections** of the paper. These sections typically provide detailed descriptions of the data used for the analysis. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and any relevant characteristics. If the authors refer to specific datasets or studies, I will note these down carefully.

I will also check the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. This is crucial, as proper citation is necessary for academic integrity and for readers who may wish to access the datasets themselves.

If the paper discusses any empirical results or case studies, I will look for mentions of datasets used in those analyses. For example, if the authors refer to a survey or a specific dataset used to illustrate their points, I will document that information.

Once I have identified the datasets, I will compile the necessary details, including the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations. If the paper does not explicitly mention datasets, I will note that as well.

Finally, I will ensure that I have accurately captured all relevant information regarding the datasets, including their context within the research, to provide a comprehensive overview.

By following these steps, I will be able to extract and document the datasets from the paper effectively, ensuring that I include full citations for each dataset mentioned.
