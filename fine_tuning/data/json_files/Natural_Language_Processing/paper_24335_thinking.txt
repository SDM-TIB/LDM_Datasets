To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MoA: Mixture of Sparse Attention for Automatic Large Language Model Compression" by Tianyu Fu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets used for experiments or calibration.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this paper, the authors mention using a **calibration dataset** and refer to specific datasets that are crucial for their methodology.

In **section 5 (Dataset and Supervision)**, the authors discuss the importance of the calibration dataset design. They mention using the **MultiNews dataset** for calibration, which includes long-range dependencies and is generated by the original dense model. This dataset is essential for profiling the attention influence.

Additionally, they reference the **RedPajama dataset**, which is a general language modeling dataset, but they highlight its limitations in capturing long-range dependencies.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the **References section** of the paper:

1. **MultiNews Dataset**: 
   > Alexander R. Fabbri, Irene Li, Tianwei She, Suyi Li, and Dragomir R. Radev. *Multi-news: A large-scale multi-document summarization dataset and abstractive hierarchical model*. In Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, 2019.

2. **RedPajama Dataset**: 
   > Together Computer. *Redpajama: An open source recipe to reproduce llama training dataset*, April 2023.

After identifying the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset's name, description, and citation.

This systematic approach ensures that I accurately capture the datasets used in the research and provide proper citations for each, which is crucial for academic integrity and future reference.
