To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Modeling motor control in continuous-time: Active Inference: a survey" by Matteo Priorelli et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and the introduction often highlights key datasets used in the research.

Next, I will look for specific sections that typically contain dataset information, such as **"Methods," "Experiments," or "Results."** These sections often detail the datasets used for analysis or experimentation. I will pay close attention to any figures or tables that might summarize dataset characteristics.

As I read through these sections, I will note any datasets explicitly mentioned, including their names, descriptions, and any relevant details such as the number of samples, types of data collected, and the context in which they were used.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets themselves.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like the "Penn Action Dataset," I will look for its citation in the references. The citation might look something like this:
> Wenzheng Zhang, Menglong Zhu, and Konstantinos G. Derpanis. *From Actemes to Action: A Strongly-Supervised Representation for Detailed Action Understanding*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 2248â€“2255, 2013.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented.

Finally, I will organize this information in a clear and structured manner, ready for presentation or further analysis. This systematic approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important datasets or citations in the paper.
