To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On Characterizing and Mitigating Imbalances in Multi-Instance Partial Label Learning" by Kaifu Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of Multi-Instance Partial Label Learning (MI-PLL) and mention that they will demonstrate the effectiveness of their techniques using specific datasets. This indicates that datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors describe their experimental setup, which typically includes the datasets used for evaluation. 

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention two datasets:

1. **MAX-M Dataset**: This dataset is used for evaluating the proposed methods in the context of MI-PLL. It consists of samples formed by pairs of MNIST digits, where the goal is to learn the maximum label from the pair.

2. **Smallest Parent Dataset**: This dataset is introduced as a new benchmark for MI-PLL, where training samples consist of CIFAR-10 images and their hierarchical relationships.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

- For the **MAX-M Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Wang, K., Tsamoura, E., & Roth, D. (2023). On Characterizing and Mitigating Imbalances in Multi-Instance Partial Label Learning. In Proceedings of the Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS).

- For the **Smallest Parent Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Wang, K., Tsamoura, E., & Roth, D. (2023). On Characterizing and Mitigating Imbalances in Multi-Instance Partial Label Learning. In Proceedings of the Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS).

Both datasets are referenced in the context of the experiments conducted in the paper, confirming their relevance and importance to the research.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation, ready for further processing or review.
