To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Rectify the Regression Bias in Long-Tailed Object Detection" by Ke Zhu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract highlights that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the **large vocabulary LVIS dataset**, which indicates that this dataset is likely to be one of the primary datasets used in the research.

Next, I will examine the **introduction section** for any additional context or mentions of datasets. The authors discuss long-tailed object detection and reference various methods and datasets, but I need to pinpoint the specific datasets they utilized.

In the **experiments section**, particularly **section 4.1**, the authors explicitly mention using the **LVIS1.0 dataset** as their main dataset, which contains 100k training and 20k validation images. They also mention using **COCO-LT** and **COCO2017** datasets to verify the generalization ability of their approach. 

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the **References section**:

1. **LVIS Dataset**:
   > Agrim Gupta, Piotr Dollar, and Ross Girshick. *LVIS: A Dataset for Large Vocabulary Instance Segmentation*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 5356–5364, 2019.

2. **COCO Dataset**:
   > Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, Serge Belongie, James Hays, Pietro Perona, Deva Ramanan, Piotr Dollar, and C Lawrence Zitnick. *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. In European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), pages 740–755, 2014.

3. **COCO-LT Dataset**:
   > Tao Wang, Yu Li, Bingyi Kang, Junnan Li, Jun Hao Liew, Sheng Tang, Steven C. H. Hoi, and Jiashi Feng. *The Devil is in Classification: A Simple Framework for Long-Tail Instance Segmentation*. In Proceedings of the European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), pages 728–744, 2020.

After identifying the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research along with their proper citations.
