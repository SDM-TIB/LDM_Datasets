To extract datasets from the research paper titled "History, Development, and Principles of Large Language Models—An Introductory Survey" by Zhibo Chu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections that discuss applications and experiments** to find any references to datasets. The abstract provides a general overview, but I will focus on the introduction and subsequent sections for specific mentions of datasets.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the evolution of language models but do not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will proceed to the **applications section** where datasets are likely to be referenced in the context of various fields such as drug discovery, finance, medical, and legal applications.

Upon reviewing the **applications section**, I find the following datasets mentioned:

1. **MedQA Dataset**: This dataset is used for biomedical question-answering and consists of USMLE-style questions. The authors mention that ChatGPT performs well on this dataset, achieving human-level passing scores.

2. **CommonCrawl**: This dataset is referenced as part of the training data for Meta AI’s LLaMA model, which is trained on publicly accessible datasets.

3. **C4 Dataset**: Another dataset mentioned in the context of training large language models, specifically for the LLaMA model.

4. **The Pile**: This dataset is described as an 800GB dataset of diverse text for language modeling, which is relevant for understanding the training of large language models.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. 

- For the **MedQA Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Jin, D., Pan, E., Oufattole, N., Weng, W. H., Fang, H., & Szolovits, P. (2021). What disease does this patient have? A large-scale open domain question answering dataset from medical exams. *Applied Sciences*, 11(14), 6421.

- For **CommonCrawl**, the citation is:
  > Common Crawl. (n.d.). Retrieved from https://commoncrawl.org/get-started

- For the **C4 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Raffel, C., Shazeer, N., Roberts, A., Lee, K., Narang, S., Matena, M., ... & Liu, P. J. (2020). Exploring the limits of transfer learning with a unified text-to-text transformer. *The Journal of Machine Learning Research*, 21(1), 5485-5551.

- For **The Pile**, the citation is:
  > Gao, L., Biderman, S., Black, S., Golding, L., Hoppe, T., Foster, C., ... & Leahy, C. (2020). The pile: An 800GB dataset of diverse text for language modeling. *arXiv preprint arXiv:2101.00027*.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their full citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
