To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Machine Learning Clifford invariants of ADE Coxeter elements" by Siqi Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the datasets discussed. The abstract mentions that the authors generated a dataset from exhaustive calculations of Coxeter transformations for A8, D8, and E8. This indicates that there are datasets related to these transformations.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets they generated. Here, they mention that they selected the three root systems A8, D8, and E8, and that the input vectors are permutations of 8 elements, which encode the order of simple roots for computing the Coxeter versor. The outputs are the invariants, referred to as the set of characteristic multivectors (SOCM).

In this section, the authors also detail the data generation process, indicating that they used Python with the galgebra package for computations and that the data was generated on high-performance computing clusters. This section provides crucial information about the datasets, including their structure and the methods used to generate them.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper does not provide specific citations for the datasets themselves, as they are generated by the authors. However, I will note that the datasets are derived from the following sources:

1. **Coxeter transformations for A8, D8, and E8**: The authors performed exhaustive calculations of these transformations, which are foundational to the datasets they generated.

2. **The galgebra package**: This is a computational tool used for the calculations in the paper, which indirectly relates to the datasets generated.

Since the datasets are original to this research and do not have external citations, I will document them as follows:

- **Dataset 1**: A8 Coxeter transformations dataset, generated from permutations of simple roots.
- **Dataset 2**: D8 Coxeter transformations dataset, generated similarly.
- **Dataset 3**: E8 Coxeter transformations dataset, generated similarly.

Finally, I will compile the information about these datasets, ensuring to include the context of their generation and the methods used, as this is essential for understanding their significance in the research.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare a structured output that summarizes the datasets, their generation methods, and their relevance to the study.
