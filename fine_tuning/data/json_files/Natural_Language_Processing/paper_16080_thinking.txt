To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Comparative Analysis of Machine Learning Models for Early Detection of Hospital-Acquired Infections" by Ethan Harvey et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study focuses on two models for predicting hospital-acquired infections (HAIs), which suggests that datasets related to these models may be discussed.

In the **introduction**, the authors describe the two models: the Infection Risk Index (IRI) and the Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP) model. They mention that the IRI model predicts all HAIs, while the VAP model specifically targets ventilator-associated pneumonia. This sets the stage for understanding the datasets used for these models.

Next, I will examine the **materials and methods section**, where the authors explicitly state that they use electronic health record (EHR) data from the **eICU Collaborative Research Database** for their comparative analysis. This is a key dataset that I need to document.

In the **results section**, the authors discuss the performance of the models using this dataset, confirming its relevance and importance in their analysis.

Now, I will look at the **references section** to find the full citation for the eICU Collaborative Research Database. The citation provided in the paper is:

- **eICU Collaborative Research Database**:
  > Tom J Pollard, Alistair EW Johnson, Jesse D Raffa, Leo A Celi, Roger G Mark, and Omar Badawi. *The eICU Collaborative Research Database, a freely available multi-center database for critical care research*. Scientific Data, 5(1):1â€“13, 2018.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets, I will focus solely on this one.

Finally, I will compile the information about the dataset, including its name, description, and citation, ensuring that I adhere to the required format for clarity and completeness. This will prepare the dataset entry for any further processing or review.
