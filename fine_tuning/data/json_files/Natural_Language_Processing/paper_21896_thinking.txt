To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Mamba-360: Survey of State Space Models as Transformer Alternative for Long Sequence Modelling: Methods, Applications, and Challenges" by Badri Narayana Patro and Vijay Srinivas Agneeswaran, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's focus, and the introduction often outlines the key datasets used in the research.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology or experiments sections**. In this paper, the authors discuss various state space models and their applications across different domains, which may include specific datasets.

In the **results section**, I will pay attention to any performance comparisons that reference specific datasets. The authors mention benchmark datasets like **Long Range Arena (LRA)**, **WikiText**, **GLUE**, **ImageNet**, **Kinetics-400**, and others, which are crucial for evaluating the performance of the models discussed.

I will also check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. For example, the Long Range Arena (LRA) benchmark is cited as:
> Yi Tay, Mostafa Dehghani, Samira Abnar, Yikang Shen, Dara Bahri, Philip Pham, Jinfeng Rao, Liu Yang, Sebastian Ruder, and Donald Metzler. *Long Range Arena: A Benchmark for Efficient Transformers*. In International Conference on Learning Representations, 2020.

Similarly, I will find citations for other datasets mentioned, such as:
- **WikiText**: 
> Stephen Merity, Caiming Xiong, James Bradbury, and Richard Socher. *Pointer Sentinel Mixture Models*. In International Conference on Learning Representations, 2016.
  
- **ImageNet**: 
> Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, and Li Fei-Fei. *ImageNet: A Large-Scale Hierarchical Image Database*. In 2009 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 248â€“255, 2009.

- **Kinetics-400**: 
> Will Kay, Joao Carreira, Karen Simonyan, Brian Zhang, Chloe Hillier, Sudheendra Vijayanarasimhan, Fabio Viola, Tim Green, Trevor Back, Paul Natsev, et al. *The Kinetics Human Action Video Dataset*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1705.06950, 2017.

After gathering the dataset names and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation.

Finally, I will ensure that all extracted datasets are accurately represented, and I will prepare the information for any further processing or review.
