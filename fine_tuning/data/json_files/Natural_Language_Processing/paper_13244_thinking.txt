To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Digital Twin-Oriented Complex Networked Systems based on Heterogeneous Node Features and Interaction Rules" by Jiaqi Wen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, results, and conclusion sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study and may mention any datasets used. The introduction often outlines the context and significance of the research, which might include references to specific datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly any subsections that discuss the experimental setup or data collection. This section is likely to contain explicit mentions of datasets, including their names and descriptions. I will look for phrases like "we used the following datasets" or "the data was sourced from."

In the **results section**, the authors may refer to the datasets again when discussing their findings. This could provide additional context or validation for the datasets mentioned earlier.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial, as proper citation is necessary for academic integrity and for others to locate the datasets.

For this paper, I will look for datasets related to the simulation-based Digital Twin-Oriented Complex Networked Systems (DT-CNSs) mentioned in the results. The authors might have used specific datasets for their simulations or case studies, particularly in the context of epidemic spread and social networks.

Once I have identified the datasets, I will compile the following information for each dataset:

1. **Name of the dataset**: The official name as mentioned in the paper.
2. **Description**: A brief overview of what the dataset contains and its relevance to the study.
3. **Full citation**: The complete reference for the dataset as found in the references section of the paper.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like "Social Network Dataset," I would note its description and then find the citation, which might look something like this:

- **Social Network Dataset**: A dataset containing interactions among individuals in a social network, used to model epidemic spread.
  > Author(s). *Title of the Dataset*. Year. Publisher/Source.

After gathering all this information, I will ensure that it is organized clearly and accurately, ready for any further processing or review.
