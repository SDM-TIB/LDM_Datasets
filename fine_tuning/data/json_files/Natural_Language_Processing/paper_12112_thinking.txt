To extract datasets from the research paper titled "EgoAdapt: A multi-stream evaluation study of adaptation to real-world egocentric user video" by Matthias De Lange et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract introduces **EgoAdapt** as a benchmark for egocentric action recognition and mentions the use of **Ego4d** video streams. This indicates that there are datasets involved, and I need to find their details.

Next, I will look into the **related work** and **methodology** sections to see if the authors discuss any specific datasets used in their experiments. In the introduction, they mention that **EgoAdapt** is based on the **Ego4d** dataset, which is a significant clue.

In the **experiments** section, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets used for training and evaluation. The paper states that **EgoAdapt** utilizes video from **Ego4d**, which is described as containing 110 hours of video across 53 different scenarios and 2740 unique actions. This is a clear indication of a dataset.

I will also check the **references** section to find the full citation for the **Ego4d** dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:
> Kristen Grauman, Andrew Westbury, Eugene Byrne, Zachary Chavis, Antonino Furnari, Rohit Girdhar, Jackson Hamburger, Hao Jiang, Miao Liu, Xingyu Liu, et al. *Ego4d: Around the world in 3,000 hours of egocentric video*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 18995–19012, 2022.

Now, I will summarize the datasets I have identified:

1. **EgoAdapt**: A benchmark for real-world egocentric action recognition that utilizes video streams from the **Ego4d** dataset.
   - Citation: Kristen Grauman, Andrew Westbury, Eugene Byrne, Zachary Chavis, Antonino Furnari, Rohit Girdhar, Jackson Hamburger, Hao Jiang, Miao Liu, Xingyu Liu, et al. *Ego4d: Around the world in 3,000 hours of egocentric video*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 18995–19012, 2022.

With this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
