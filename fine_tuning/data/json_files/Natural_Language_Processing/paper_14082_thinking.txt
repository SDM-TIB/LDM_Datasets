To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Social interactions for a sustainable lifestyle: The design of an experimental case study" by A. Fontan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** to identify any mentions of datasets or data collection methods. The abstract indicates that the study involves observing behaviors related to sustainability in the context of smart residential homes, which suggests that there may be datasets related to participant behaviors and sustainability indicators.

Next, I will examine **section 2 (Experimental Setup)**, particularly **subsection 2.1 (KTH Live-In Lab)**, where the authors describe the KTH Live-In Lab as a platform for conducting experiments. This section likely contains details about the data collected from the sensors and the participants involved in the study.

In **subsection 3.2 (Sustainability Indicators)**, the authors outline the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) used to measure sustainability practices. They mention a 17-item questionnaire distributed to participants, which serves as a dataset for measuring behaviors related to sustainability. I will note the specific dimensions and items included in this questionnaire, as they represent a structured dataset.

Additionally, I will look for any references to external datasets or previous studies that may have been used as benchmarks or comparisons in the research. This could be found in the **References section** or within the text where the authors discuss related work.

After identifying the datasets, I will compile the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. For example, the KTH Live-In Lab is referenced in the context of data collection, and I will ensure to cite the relevant paper that describes this lab:

- For the KTH Live-In Lab, the citation is:
  > Molinari, M., Vogel, J.A., Rolando, D., Lundqvist, P.L. (2023). Using living labs to tackle innovation bottlenecks: the KTH Live-In Lab case study. *Applied Energy*, 338, 120877.

Next, I will summarize the datasets identified, including the sustainability indicators and the questionnaire items, ensuring to provide context for how they were used in the study.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for each identified dataset, ensuring that I include the full citations as required. This structured approach will help ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.
