To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On the Relevance of Phoneme Duration Variability of Synthesized Training Data for Automatic Speech Recognition" by Nick Rossenbach et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of synthetic data generated by text-to-speech (TTS) systems to improve automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems, which suggests that datasets related to TTS and ASR might be involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors reference the use of synthetic data from TTS systems and mention the LibriSpeech dataset as a standard task for many publications on synthetic data generation. This indicates that the LibriSpeech dataset is likely one of the datasets used in their experiments.

In the **experiments section**, specifically section 5.1, the authors explicitly state that they are using the **train-clean-100 part of LibriSpeech** as annotated training data and the **train-clean-360 part of LibriSpeech** as text-only data. This confirms the datasets used in their study.

Now, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citation for the LibriSpeech dataset is:

- For **LibriSpeech**:
  > Vassil Panayotov, Guoguo Chen, Daniel Povey, and Sanjeev Khudanpur. *Librispeech: An ASR corpus based on public domain audio books*. In ICASSP, 2015, pp. 5206â€“5210, IEEE.

Having identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. Each dataset will be described with its name, description, and citation, ensuring that the full citation is included for each dataset.
