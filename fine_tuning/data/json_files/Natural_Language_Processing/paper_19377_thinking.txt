To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Analysis of Multi-Source Language Training in Cross-Lingual Transfer" by Seong Hoon Lim et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the research focus and any datasets that may be referenced. The abstract mentions the use of multilingual language models and cross-lingual transfer, which suggests that datasets related to these topics will be discussed.

Next, I will examine **section 4 (Verifying the Effectiveness of MSLT)**, particularly **subsection 4.1 (Experimental Settings)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention three specific datasets:

1. **WikiAnn**: A named entity recognition dataset sourced from Wikipedia, comprising 282 language data segments. The authors specify that they utilize 7 languages as source languages and 8 languages as target languages for cross-lingual transfer.

2. **XNLI**: An evaluation corpus for language transfer and cross-lingual sentence classification in 15 languages. The authors indicate that this dataset is used for evaluating the performance of their models.

3. **XCOPA**: A benchmark designed to evaluate commonsense reasoning across different languages, which includes translations and reannotations of the English COPA dataset.

In addition to these, I will also look for any other datasets mentioned in the **appendices** or **related work** sections. The appendix provides further details about the datasets, confirming the languages involved and their specific roles in the experiments.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset from the **References section** of the paper:

- For **WikiAnn**, the citation is:
  > Pan, B., Zhang, B., May, J., Nothman, J., Knight, K., & Ji, H. (2017). Cross-lingual name tagging and linking for 282 languages. In Proceedings of the 55th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers), pages 1946–1958, Vancouver, Canada.

- For **XNLI**, the citation is:
  > Conneau, A., Rinott, R., Lample, G., Williams, A., Bowman, S., Schwenk, H., & Stoyanov, V. (2018). XNLI: Evaluating cross-lingual sentence representations. In Proceedings of the 2018 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 2475–2485, Brussels, Belgium.

- For **XCOPA**, the citation is:
  > Ponti, E., Glavaš, G., Majewska, O., Liu, Q., Vulić, I., & Korhonen, A. (2020). XCOPA: A multilingual dataset for causal common-sense reasoning. In Proceedings of the 2020 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), pages 2362–2376, Online.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited, ready for further processing or review.
