To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Language Model Cascades: Token-level uncertainty and beyond" by Neha Gupta et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental setup and results sections** where datasets are typically detailed. In this paper, the authors mention several datasets in the context of evaluating their proposed methods. Specifically, I will look for sections that discuss the datasets used for experiments, which are often labeled clearly.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find the following datasets mentioned:

1. **MNLI (Multi-Genre Natural Language Inference)**: This dataset is used for evaluating the performance of the proposed methods in a multi-class classification setting. The citation for MNLI is:
   > Williams, A., Nangia, N., & Bowman, S. R. (2018). A broad-coverage challenge corpus for sentence understanding through inference. *Proceedings of the 2018 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, Volume 1 (Long Papers)*, 1112-1122.

2. **TriviaQA**: This dataset is utilized for closed-book question answering tasks. The citation for TriviaQA is:
   > Joshi, M., Choi, E., Weld, D. S., & Zettlemoyer, L. (2017). TriviaQA: A large scale distantly supervised challenge dataset for reading comprehension. *Proceedings of the 55th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers)*, 1601-1611.

3. **WMT DE → FR (Translation from German to French)**: This dataset is used for translation tasks. The citation for WMT is:
   > Bojar, O., Buck, C., Federmann, C., Haddow, B., Koehn, P., Leveling, J., Monz, C., Pecina, P., Post, M., Saint-Amand, H., Soricut, R., & Specia, L. (2014). Findings of the 2014 workshop on statistical machine translation. *Proceedings of the Ninth Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation*, 12-58.

4. **WMT EN → FR (Translation from English to French)**: Another translation dataset mentioned in the paper. The citation for this dataset is the same as above.

5. **WMT FR → EN (Translation from French to English)**: This dataset is also used for translation tasks. The citation remains consistent with the previous WMT citations.

6. **SQuAD (Stanford Question Answering Dataset)**: This dataset is used for reading comprehension tasks. The citation for SQuAD is:
   > Rajpurkar, P., Zhang, J., Lopyrev, K., & Liang, P. (2016). SQuAD: 100,000+ questions for machine comprehension of text. *Proceedings of the 2016 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing*, 2383-2392.

7. **Lambada**: This dataset is used for evaluating the ability of models to predict the last word of sentences given a broad context. The citation for Lambada is:
   > Paperno, D., Kruszewski, G., Lazaridou, A., Pham, N. Q., Bernardi, R., Pezzelle, S., Boleda, G., & Fernández, R. (2016). The LAMBADA dataset: Word prediction requiring a broad discourse context. *Proceedings of the 54th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers)*, 1525-1534.

After identifying these datasets, I will ensure to compile the information into a structured format for further processing or review. This systematic approach ensures that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.
