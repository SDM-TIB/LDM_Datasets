To extract datasets from the research paper titled "FENICE: Factuality Evaluation of Summarization Based on Natural Language Inference and Claim Extraction" by Alessandro Scirè et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract highlights the introduction of FENICE and its evaluation on AGGREFACT, which suggests that AGGREFACT is a dataset used in their experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors discuss their methodology and the datasets used for evaluation. In section 4.1, they mention the use of **XSum** and **CNN/DailyMail** datasets for training their claim extraction model. This is a crucial finding as it indicates the datasets utilized in their experiments.

In section 4.2, they refer to **AGGREFACT** as the benchmark for evaluating summarization factuality metrics. This dataset is central to their evaluation process and is mentioned multiple times throughout the paper.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. **XSum Dataset**: The citation is:

2. **CNN/DailyMail Dataset**: The citation is:

3. **AGGREFACT Dataset**: The citation is:

In Proceedings of the 61st Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers), pages 11626–11644, Toronto, Canada. Association for Computational Linguistics.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their respective citations.
