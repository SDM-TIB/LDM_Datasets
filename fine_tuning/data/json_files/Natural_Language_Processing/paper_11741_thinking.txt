To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Simple Estimation of Semiparametric Models with Measurement Errors" by Kirill S. Evdokimov and Andrei Zeleneev, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract typically provides a concise overview, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or data sources.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any context regarding the datasets used in the research. This section often outlines the problem being addressed and may mention specific datasets that are relevant to the study.

I will then focus on the **methodology section**, where the authors describe their approach. This section is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets, including their names, characteristics, and how they were utilized in the analysis.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **results section** to see if the authors discuss the datasets in the context of their findings. This may provide additional insights into the datasets' relevance and application.

Finally, I will consult the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. It is crucial to document the complete citation for each dataset to ensure proper attribution and facilitate further research.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is clearly documented for future reference.
