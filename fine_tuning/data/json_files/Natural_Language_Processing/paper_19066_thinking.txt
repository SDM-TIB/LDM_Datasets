To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-Query Focused Disaster Summarization via Instruction-Based Prompting" by Philipp Seeberger and Korbinian Riedhammer, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the "CrisisFACTS" challenge, which suggests that there may be a dataset associated with this challenge.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe the dataset used for their experiments. Here, they mention that the CrisisFACTS 2023 challenge includes a total of 10 disaster events along with additional metadata such as search keywords, queries, and source types. This indicates that the dataset is specifically designed for disaster summarization tasks.

In this section, the authors also refer to the official CrisisFACTS website for further details about the dataset. This is a crucial step, as it allows me to find the official citation for the dataset.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the CrisisFACTS dataset. The authors do not provide a specific citation for the dataset in the paper, but they reference the CrisisFACTS website. Therefore, I will use the following citation for the dataset:

- **CrisisFACTS Dataset**: 
  > McCreadie, R., & Buntain, C. L. (2023). CrisisFACTS: Building and Evaluating Crisis Timelines. In Proceedings of the 20th International ISCRAM Conference, pages 320â€“339.

After identifying the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the key details of the dataset:

1. **CrisisFACTS Dataset**: This dataset includes a total of 10 disaster events and additional metadata such as search keywords, queries, and source types. It is specifically designed for the CrisisFACTS challenge, which focuses on disaster summarization.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that highlights the dataset and its citation, ensuring that all necessary details are included for future reference or processing.
