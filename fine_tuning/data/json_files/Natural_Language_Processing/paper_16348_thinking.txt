To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SNN Architecture for Differential Time Encoding Using Decoupled Processing Time" by Daniel Windhager et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the architecture's performance on the MNIST dataset, which is a strong indication that this dataset is used in the research.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (specifically section III) where the authors describe their testing methodology. Here, they explicitly mention using the **MNIST dataset** for evaluating their spiking neural network architecture. The paper provides details about the network structure and the results obtained, confirming that MNIST is indeed the dataset utilized for their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the MNIST dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:

- **MNIST Dataset**:
  > Y. LeCun, C. Cortes, and C. Burges, “MNIST Handwritten Digit Database,” 2010. [Online]. Available: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist

Since the MNIST dataset is the only dataset mentioned in the paper, I will compile this information into a structured format, ensuring that the full citation is included.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for the MNIST dataset, ensuring that all relevant details are captured accurately for future reference or processing.
