To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Distilling Large Language Models for Text-Attributed Graph Learning" by Bo Pan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, but I will need to look deeper into the paper for specific dataset names.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, the authors mention evaluating their proposed framework on four text-attributed graph datasets: **Cora**, **Pubmed**, **ogbn-products**, and **arxiv-2023**. This is a clear indication that these datasets are central to their research.

I will then look for detailed descriptions of each dataset, which are often provided in a table or a dedicated subsection. In this case, the paper includes a **Table 5** that summarizes the statistics of the datasets, including the number of nodes, edges, and classes for each dataset. This information is crucial for understanding the datasets' characteristics.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset from the references section of the paper. The citations for the datasets mentioned are as follows:

1. **Cora Dataset**: 
   > McCallum, A. K., Nigam, K., Rennie, J., & Seymore, K. (2000). Automating the construction of internet portals with machine learning. *Information Retrieval*, 3, 127–163.

2. **Pubmed Dataset**: 
   > Sen, P., Namata, G., Bilgic, M., Getoor, L., Galligher, J., & Eliassi-Rad, T. (2008). Collective classification in network data. *AI Magazine*, 29(3), 93–93.

3. **ogbn-products Dataset**: 
   > Hu, W., Fey, M., Zitnik, M., Dong, Y., Ren, H., Liu, B., Catasta, M., & Leskovec, J. (2020). Open graph benchmark: Datasets for machine learning on graphs. *Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems*, 33, 22118–22133.

4. **arxiv-2023 Dataset**: 
   > He, X., Bresson, X., Laurent, T., & Hooi, B. (2023). Explanations as features: LLM-based features for text-attributed graphs. *arXiv preprint arXiv:2305.19523*.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, which is essential for reproducibility and further studies in the field.
