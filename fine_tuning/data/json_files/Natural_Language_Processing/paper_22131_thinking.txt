To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Adaptive Bidirectional Displacement for Semi-Supervised Medical Image Segmentation" by Hanyang Chi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study and may mention datasets used for evaluation. The introduction often elaborates on the challenges in the field and may reference specific datasets that are commonly used.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used in their experiments. In this section, I will look for detailed descriptions of each dataset, including the number of samples, types of data, and any specific characteristics that are relevant to the study.

In this paper, I find the following datasets mentioned:

1. **ACDC Dataset**: The ACDC dataset consists of 200 annotated short-axis cardiac cine-MR images from 100 patients, divided into four classes. The data split includes 70 patients for training, 10 for validation, and 20 for testing.

2. **PROMISE12 Dataset**: The PROMISE12 dataset was created for the MICCAI 2012 prostate segmentation challenge and includes MRI scans of 50 patients with various diseases. The 3D scans are converted into 2D slices for analysis.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations I find are:

- For the **ACDC Dataset**:
  > Bernard, O., Lalande, A., Zotti, C., Cervenansky, F., Yang, X., Heng, P.-A., Cetin, I., Lekadir, K., Camara, O., Gonzalez Ballester, M. A., et al. (2018). Deep learning techniques for automatic MRI cardiac multi-structures segmentation and diagnosis: is the problem solved? *IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging*, 37(11), 2514-2525.

- For the **PROMISE12 Dataset**:
  > Litjens, G., Toth, R., Van De Ven, W., Hoeks, C., Kerkstra, S., Van Ginneken, G., Guillard, G., Birbeck, N., Zhang, J., et al. (2014). Evaluation of prostate segmentation algorithms for MRI: the PROMISE12 challenge. *Medical Image Analysis*, 18(2), 359-373.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured all necessary details for each dataset mentioned in the paper.
