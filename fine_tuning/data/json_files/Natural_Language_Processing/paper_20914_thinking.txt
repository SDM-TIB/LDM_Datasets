To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Measuring Political Bias in Large Language Models: What Is Said and How It Is Said" by Yejin Bang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions measuring political bias in LLMs and hints at the use of various political topics, which suggests that datasets related to these topics may be present.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to identify any specific datasets mentioned. The authors discuss the evaluation of eleven open-sourced LLMs and their political biases, but I need to look for explicit mentions of datasets.

In the **methodology section**, particularly in **section 3 (Framework Implementation)**, the authors describe the political topics they selected for analysis. They mention using a set of natural language instructions covering 14 politically divisive topics, which indicates that they have created or utilized datasets for these topics. However, I need to check if they provide specific dataset names or references.

The paper lists the political topics in **section 3.1** as follows:
- Reproductive Rights
- Immigration
- Gun Control
- Same Sex Marriage
- Death Penalty
- Climate Change
- Drug Price Regulation
- Public Education
- Healthcare Reform
- Social Media Regulation
- Black Lives Matter
- Hong Kong Protest
- Liancourt Rocks dispute
- Russia Ukraine war

While these topics are important, they do not constitute datasets by themselves. I will need to look for any references to existing datasets or any datasets created by the authors for their experiments.

In the **results section**, the authors discuss their findings based on the analysis of the LLMs, but they do not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will check the **references section** to see if any datasets are cited there.

Upon reviewing the references, I find that the authors cite several studies and datasets related to political bias and framing analysis. However, they do not provide specific datasets that they created or used in their experiments. Instead, they reference existing literature that may contain datasets relevant to their analysis.

To summarize, I will compile the following datasets based on the topics discussed in the paper, along with their citations:

1. **Political Topics Dataset**: This dataset is not explicitly named in the paper, but it is implied that the authors created a dataset based on the 14 politically divisive topics they selected for analysis. Since no specific citation is provided, I will note that this dataset is based on the authors' framework.

2. **Existing Datasets**: The authors reference various studies that may contain datasets relevant to political bias analysis. I will include citations for these studies, as they may provide useful datasets for future research.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations. Since the paper does not provide explicit dataset names or citations for datasets they created, I will focus on the references that may contain relevant datasets.

After gathering this information, I will ensure that each dataset entry is clearly documented with full citations for any referenced studies, while also noting the absence of specific dataset names created by the authors.
