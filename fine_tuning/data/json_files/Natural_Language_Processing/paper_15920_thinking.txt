To extract datasets from the research paper titled "WHAT LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS BRING TO TEXT-RICH VQA?" by Xuejing Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information and provide full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on four text-rich VQA datasets, which suggests that these datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention four datasets:

1. **StVQA**: This dataset is derived from a challenge on scene text visual question answering, emphasizing the importance of understanding textual details within a scene.

2. **TextVQA**: This dataset also requires models to read and reason about texts in images to answer questions.

3. **OCRVQA**: This dataset consists of 207,572 images featuring book covers and includes over 1 million question-answer pairs related to these images.

4. **DocVQA**: This dataset focuses on Document Visual Question Answering, where a comprehensive understanding of a document image is crucial for accurate responses.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **StVQA**, the citation is:
  > Biten, A. F., Tito, R., Mafla, A., Gomez, L., Rusinol, M., & Karatzas, C. (2019). Scene text visual question answering. In ICCV (pp. 4291–4301).

- For **TextVQA**, the citation is:
  > Singh, A., Natarajan, V., Shah, M., Jiang, Y., Chen, X., Parikh, D., & Rohrbach, M. (2019). Towards VQA models that can read. In CVPR (pp. 8317–8326).

- For **OCRVQA**, the citation is:
  > Mishra, A., Shekhar, S., Singh, A. K., & Chakraborty, A. (2019). OCR-VQA: Visual question answering by reading text in images. In ICDAR.

- For **DocVQA**, the citation is:
  > Mathew, M., Karatzas, C., & Jawahar, C. V. (2021). DocVQA: A dataset for VQA on document images. In WACV (pp. 2200–2209).

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly presents each dataset along with its citation. This will ensure that the datasets are accurately represented and easily accessible for further reference or analysis.
