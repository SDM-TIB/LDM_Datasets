To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Forecasting Bitcoin Volatility: A Comparative Analysis of Volatility Approaches" by Cristina Chinazzo and Vahidin Jeleskovic, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the analysis of Bitcoin return series and mentions three volatility metrics, but it does not specify datasets. The introduction provides context about Bitcoin's volatility but does not explicitly mention datasets either.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Data description)**, which is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets used in the study. Here, the authors state that they acquired bid-ask daily prices of options traded on the LedgerX platform from January 1, 2019, to July 31, 2019, and historical series of the underlying BTC/USD from April 28, 2013, to July 31, 2019. This section clearly identifies the datasets used for the analysis.

The two datasets I will extract are:

1. **LedgerX Options Dataset**: This dataset includes bid-ask daily prices of Bitcoin options traded on the LedgerX platform from January 1, 2019, to July 31, 2019.

2. **BTC/USD Historical Price Dataset**: This dataset consists of historical prices of Bitcoin against the US dollar, covering the period from April 28, 2013, to July 31, 2019.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. However, since the datasets are derived from the LedgerX platform and the BTC/USD historical prices, they may not have formal citations like traditional datasets. Instead, I will note the source as follows:

- For the **LedgerX Options Dataset**, I will reference the platform itself:
  > LedgerX. (2019). Daily bid-ask prices of Bitcoin options. Retrieved from [LedgerX website].

- For the **BTC/USD Historical Price Dataset**, I will also reference the source:
  > LedgerX. (2019). Historical BTC/USD price series. Retrieved from [LedgerX website].

Now that I have identified the datasets and their sources, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets along with their citations for future reference or analysis.
