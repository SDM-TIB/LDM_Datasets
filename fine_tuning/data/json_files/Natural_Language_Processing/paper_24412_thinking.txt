To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Detecting Abnormal Operations in Concentrated Solar Power Plants from Irregular Sequences of Thermal Images" by Sukanya Patra et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are referenced. The abstract mentions a dataset collected over a year from an operational CSP plant, which indicates that there is a primary dataset involved.

Next, I will look for specific sections that discuss the datasets in detail. In this case, the **Data Description** section (3.1) provides a comprehensive overview of the dataset used in the study. Here, the authors describe the dataset as consisting of thermal images captured at irregular intervals from an operational CSP plant, detailing the characteristics of the images and the context in which they were collected.

The paper also mentions that the dataset is confidential but that a simulated dataset is released. I will need to note both the original dataset and the simulated dataset.

1. **Original Dataset**: The dataset consists of thermal images captured from infrared cameras mounted on solar receivers in a CSP plant. The images are taken at irregular intervals (1 to 5 minutes) over a year, totaling 16,917 triplets of images, timestamps, and labels (normal or abnormal).

2. **Simulated Dataset**: The authors mention that they have released a simulated dataset for reproducibility. This dataset is generated using a variational autoencoder, and while specific details about its structure are not provided, it is important to note its existence.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. However, since the original dataset is confidential and not publicly cited, I will focus on the simulated dataset.

For the simulated dataset, the authors do not provide a specific citation in the references, but they mention that it is generated using a variational autoencoder. I will summarize this information accordingly.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries:

- **Original Dataset**: 
  - Description: Thermal images collected from an operational CSP plant, captured at irregular intervals over a year.
  - Citation: Not publicly available due to confidentiality.

- **Simulated Dataset**: 
  - Description: A dataset generated using a variational autoencoder to mirror the properties of the original dataset.
  - Citation: Not specifically cited in the paper.

Finally, I will ensure that I have accurately captured the essence of the datasets and their relevance to the research conducted in the paper. This structured approach will help in presenting the datasets clearly and effectively.
