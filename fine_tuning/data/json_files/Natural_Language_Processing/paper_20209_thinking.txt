To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Price Gouging or Market Forces? Fairness Perceptions of Price Hikes in the Pandemic" by Avichai Snir et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that surveys were conducted in the U.S. and Israel, which suggests that the data collected from these surveys is a primary dataset.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Methodology and Data)**, where the authors describe the survey methodology in detail. They mention that they conducted surveys with **904 respondents in the U.S.** and **1,043 respondents in Israel**. This information is crucial as it outlines the sample size and the geographical context of the dataset.

In this section, the authors also specify the goods that were included in the survey: **facemasks, hand sanitizers, toilet paper, chicken, and Dijon mustard**. This indicates that the dataset includes responses related to these specific products and their perceived price fairness during the pandemic.

I will also check the **Appendix** for any additional details about the survey questionnaire, which may provide insights into the structure of the dataset, including the types of questions asked and the response options.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets or methodologies referenced. However, since the dataset is based on the authors' original survey, I will cite the paper itself as the source of the dataset.

The citation for the dataset derived from this research paper is:
> Snir, A., Levy, D., Levy, D., & Chen, H. A. (2024). Price Gouging or Market Forces? Fairness Perceptions of Price Hikes in the Pandemic. *Department of Economics, Bar-Ilan University*.

In summary, I have identified the dataset as the survey data collected from respondents in the U.S. and Israel regarding their perceptions of price increases for specific goods during the pandemic. I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing.
