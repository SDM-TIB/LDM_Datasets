To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CAN PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES BOOST EACH OTHER VIA INSTRUCTION TUNING?" by Daoguang Zan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on **8 popular programming languages** and released their training data, which suggests that there are datasets involved.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **methodology** section, particularly in **section 2.1 (Crafting Training Corpus of Eight Programming Languages)**. Here, the authors describe constructing training data for each of the eight programming languages: Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, C, C++, Java, Go, and HTML. Each language has about **9K programming exercises**, which indicates that these are the datasets used for their experiments.

In the **experiments section**, I will check for any additional details or confirmations regarding the datasets used. The authors mention using **HumanEval-X** to evaluate the models, which is another dataset relevant to their experiments.

Now, I will compile the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. **HumanEval-X**: The citation for this dataset is:
   > Qinkai Zheng, Xiao Xia, Xu Zou, Yuxiao Dong, Shanshan Wang, Yufei Xue, Zi-Yuan Wang, Lei Shen, Andi Wang, Yang Li, Teng Su, Zhilin Yang, and Jie Tang. *CodeGeeX: A pre-trained model for code generation with multilingual evaluations on humaneval-x*. ArXiv, abs/2303.17568, 2023.

2. **CodeAlpaca 20K**: The citation for this dataset is:
   > N/A (The paper does not provide a specific citation for CodeAlpaca 20K, but it is mentioned as a source for constructing the training data).

3. **Training datasets for each programming language**: While the authors describe the datasets for each programming language, they do not provide specific citations for these datasets as they are constructed from existing resources.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets and their citations in a structured format for clarity and future reference. This will ensure that I have accurately captured all relevant datasets and their sources from the paper.
