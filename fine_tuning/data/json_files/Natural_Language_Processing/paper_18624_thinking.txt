To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Physics-Inspired Degradation Models for Hyperspectral Image Fusion" by Jie Lian et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a general overview of the research focus, while the introduction often highlights the datasets used for experiments.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of modeling degradation processes in hyperspectral imaging and mention the need for datasets that reflect real-world scenarios. This suggests that datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, specifically **subsection 4.1 (Datasets Description)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention:

1. **HypSen Dataset**: This dataset is referenced as being used for real data experiments.
2. **World View-2 (WV) Dataset**: Another dataset used for real data experiments.
3. **Ziyuan 1-02D (ZY) Dataset**: Also used in the experiments.
4. **Gaofen5-Gaofen1 (GF5-GF1) Dataset**: Mentioned as part of the real datasets.
5. **Pavia University Dataset**: Used as an auxiliary dataset for synthesizing training samples.
6. **Washington DC Dataset**: Another auxiliary dataset for training sample synthesis.
7. **Chikusei Dataset**: Included as an auxiliary dataset.
8. **Xiongan Dataset**: Also mentioned as an auxiliary dataset.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. The citations will provide the necessary details for proper attribution.

For the datasets mentioned, I will compile the following citations:

- **HypSen Dataset**:

After gathering all this information, I will summarize the datasets and their citations in a structured format for easy reference. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations for future use.
