To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Assessing Step-by-Step Reasoning against Lexical Negation: A Case Study on Syllogism" by Mengyu Ye et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on evaluating large language models (LLMs) and may hint at the datasets used for this evaluation.

Next, I will examine the **methodology section**, particularly the parts that discuss the experimental settings and tasks. This section is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets used in the experiments. For instance, the authors mention collecting instances from the **BIG-Bench dataset** for the SPORTS TASK, which is a clear indication of a dataset being utilized.

I will also look for any references to datasets in the **results and discussion sections**, as these may provide additional context or confirm the datasets used in the experiments.

Once I have identified the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

From my reading, I have identified the following datasets:

1. **BIG-Bench dataset**: This dataset was used for the SPORTS TASK, which involved evaluating the reasoning abilities of LLMs in the context of sports-related sentences.

2. **Custom datasets**: The authors also mention that they created custom datasets for the OCCUPATION TASK and WEIGHT TRANSITION TASK, which were designed to assess reasoning abilities in different contexts.

Now, I will compile the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **BIG-Bench dataset**, the citation is:
  > Aarohi Srivastava, Abhinav Rastogi, Abhishek Rao, Abu Awal Md Shoeb, Abubakar Abid, Adam Fisch, Adam R. Brown, Adam Santoro, Aditya Gupta, Adri√† Garriga-Alonso, et al. *Beyond the Imitation Game: Quantifying and Extrapolating the Capabilities of Language Models*. arXiv preprint, cs.CL/2206.04615v2.

- For the **custom datasets** created for the study, since they are not standard datasets, I will note that they were developed specifically for the experiments described in the paper and may not have formal citations.

Finally, I will summarize the datasets and their citations in a structured format for clarity and future reference.
