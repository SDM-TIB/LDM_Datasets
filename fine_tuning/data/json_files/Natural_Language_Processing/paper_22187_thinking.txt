To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Exponentially Consistent Outlier Hypothesis Testing for Continuous Sequences" by Lina Zhu and Lin Zhou, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any references to datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** closely, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets they used for their analyses. I will look for specific names of datasets, their characteristics, and any relevant details such as the number of samples, types of data, and how they were utilized in the study.

If the paper includes a **results or discussion section**, I will check there as well for any additional mentions of datasets, especially if the authors discuss the performance of their methods on different datasets.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily. I will ensure that I capture all necessary details such as authors, title, publication venue, and year.

For example, if I find that the authors used a dataset called "Synthetic Outlier Dataset," I will look for its citation in the references. If it is not directly cited, I will note the details provided in the paper and search for the original source if necessary.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset entry includes:
- The name of the dataset
- A brief description of the dataset
- The full citation for the dataset

This structured approach will help ensure that I capture all relevant information about the datasets used in the research paper accurately and comprehensively.
