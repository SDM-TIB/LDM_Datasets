To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On training locally adaptive CP" by Nicolo Colombo, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview, and the introduction often highlights the datasets used for experiments or comparisons.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 3), where the author describes the datasets used for testing the proposed methods. In this section, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, descriptions, and any relevant details such as the number of observations and attributes.

Upon reviewing Section 3.2 (Real data), I find the following datasets mentioned:

1. **Energy Efficiency Data Set**: This dataset contains 768 observations with eight attributes. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Tsanas, A., & Xifara, A. (2012). *Energy efficiency*. UCI Machine Learning Repository. DOI: 10.24432/C51307.

2. **Concrete Compressive Strength Data Set**: This dataset consists of 1030 observations with nine attributes. The citation is:
   > Yeh, I.-C. (2007). *Concrete Compressive Strength*. UCI Machine Learning Repository. DOI: 10.24432/C5PK67.

3. **King County Home Price Data Set**: This dataset has 21,613 observations with 14 attributes. The citation is:
   > King County. (2015). *House Sales in King County, USA*. Kaggle. DOI: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harlfoxem/housesalesprediction.

4. **Physicochemical Properties of Protein Tertiary Structure Data Set**: This dataset includes 45,730 observations with nine attributes. The citation is:
   > Rana, P. (2013). *Physicochemical Properties of Protein Tertiary Structure*. UCI Machine Learning Repository. DOI: 10.24432/C5QW3H.

5. **Facebook Comment Volume Data Set**: This dataset contains 40,949 observations with 54 attributes. The citation is:
   > Singh, K. (2016). *Facebook Comment Volume Dataset*. UCI Machine Learning Repository. DOI: 10.24432/C5Q886.

After identifying these datasets, I will ensure that I have the correct citations for each one, as they are crucial for proper referencing and acknowledgment in any subsequent work.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ready for any further processing or review.
