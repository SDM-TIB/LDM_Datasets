To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Investigating the Indirect Object Identification circuit in Mamba" by Danielle Ensign and AdriÃ  Garriga-Alonso, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, but it may not contain detailed dataset information. The introduction often outlines the context and significance of the research, which might include references to datasets used in prior studies or the current research.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets or experiments**. In this paper, the authors discuss the Indirect Object Identification (IOI) task and mention using a dataset for this purpose. I will pay close attention to any specific datasets referenced, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

In the **experiments section**, I will look for any details about the dataset used for the IOI task. The authors may describe how the dataset was constructed, the types of data it includes, and any relevant statistics that help characterize it.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. I will ensure that I capture the complete citation format, including authors, title, publication venue, and year.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like "The Pile," I will find the corresponding citation:
- For "The Pile," the citation is:
  > Gao, L., Biderman, S., Black, S., Golding, L., Hoppe, T., Foster, C., Phang, J., He, H., Thite, A., Nabeshima, N., Presser, S., and Leahy, C. *The Pile: An 800gb dataset of diverse text for language modeling*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2101.00027, 2020.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, facilitating further exploration and validation of the findings presented in the paper.
