To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Enhancing Confidence Expression in Large Language Models Through Learning from Past Experience" by Haixia Han et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract indicates that experiments were conducted using "four datasets," which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **methods** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors mention using four datasets: **C-Eval**, **XieZhi**, **GSM8K**, and **CommonsenseQA**. I will note down the context in which these datasets are used, particularly focusing on how they relate to the experiments conducted.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide a brief description of each dataset. I will extract the relevant details about each dataset's purpose and characteristics. For instance, they mention that C-Eval is a multi-level multi-discipline Chinese evaluation suite, XieZhi is an ever-updating benchmark for holistic domain knowledge evaluation, GSM8K is a dataset for solving math word problems, and CommonsenseQA is a question-answering challenge targeting commonsense knowledge.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. Here are the citations I will extract:

1. **C-Eval**:
   > Huang, Y., Bai, Y., Zhu, Z., Zhang, J., Zhang, J., Su, T., Liu, J., Lv, C., Zhang, Y., et al. (2024). C-eval: A multi-level multi-discipline Chinese evaluation suite for foundation models. *Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems*, 36.

2. **XieZhi**:
   > Gu, Z., Zhu, X., Ye, H., Zhang, L., Wang, J., Zhu, Y., Jiang, S., Xiong, Z., Li, Z., Wu, W., et al. (2024). Xiezhi: An ever-updating benchmark for holistic domain knowledge evaluation. *Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence*, 38, 18099â€“18107.

3. **GSM8K**:
   > Cobbe, K., Kosaraju, V., Bavarian, M., Chen, M., Jun, H., Kaiser, L., Plappert, M., Tworek, J., Hilton, J., Nakano, R., et al. (2021). Training verifiers to solve math word problems. *arXiv preprint arXiv:2110.14168*.

4. **CommonsenseQA**:
   > Talmor, A., Herzig, J., Lourie, N., & Berant, J. (2018). Commonsenseqa: A question answering challenge targeting commonsense knowledge. *arXiv preprint arXiv:1811.00937*.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their respective references.
