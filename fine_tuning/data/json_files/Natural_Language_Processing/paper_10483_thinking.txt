To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Prompting with Pseudo-Code Instructions" by Mayank Mishra et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors created a dataset of pseudo-code prompts for 132 different tasks sourced from the Super-NaturalInstructions dataset. This indicates that there is at least one dataset involved.

Next, I will look for specific sections that discuss datasets in detail, particularly the **Datasets** section, which is likely to provide comprehensive information about the datasets used in the research. In this case, I will focus on the **section 3 (Dataset)**, where the authors describe the Super-NaturalInstructions dataset, which comprises 1,616 diverse NLP tasks.

In this section, the authors mention that they sampled a mix of 132 tasks from the Super-NaturalInstructions dataset and rewrote instructions using Python constructs. This confirms that the Super-NaturalInstructions dataset is a primary dataset used in their research.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Super-NaturalInstructions dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:
> Wang, Y., Kordi, Y., Mishra, S., Liu, A., Smith, N. A., Khashabi, D., & Hajishirzi, H. (2022). Super-NaturalInstructions: Generalization via declarative instructions on 1600+ NLP tasks. In Proceedings of the 2022 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 5085–5109, Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. Association for Computational Linguistics.

Additionally, I will look for any other datasets mentioned throughout the paper, especially in the **Evaluation** or **Experiments** sections. The authors reference various tasks and datasets used for evaluation, such as MultiRC, McTaco, and others. I will compile these datasets along with their citations.

For example, I will extract the following datasets mentioned in the paper:

1. **Super-NaturalInstructions Dataset**:
   - Citation: Wang, Y., Kordi, Y., Mishra, S., Liu, A., Smith, N. A., Khashabi, D., & Hajishirzi, H. (2022).

In Proceedings of the 2022 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 5085–5109, Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. Association for Computational Linguistics.

2. **MultiRC Dataset**:
   - Citation: Khashabi, D., Khot, T., & Roth, D. (2018). MultiRC: A large-scale dataset for reading comprehension with multi-sentence reasoning. In Proceedings of the 2018 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, Volume 1 (Long Papers), pages 193–203, New Orleans, Louisiana. Association for Computational Linguistics.

3. **McTaco Dataset**:
   - Citation: Zhou, B., & Roth, D. (2019). McTaco: A dataset for multi-choice question answering. In Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, pages 5020–5031, Florence, Italy. Association for Computational Linguistics.

After gathering all relevant datasets and their citations, I will ensure that I have accurately captured the information and formatted it correctly for any further processing or review.
