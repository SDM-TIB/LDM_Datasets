To extract datasets from the research paper titled "FABLE: Fabric Anomaly Detection Automation" by Simon Thomine et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and related works sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. In the abstract, the authors discuss fabric anomaly detection and mention a dataset called **MVTEC AD**, which is a significant clue that there are datasets involved.

Next, I will examine the **introduction section**, where the authors elaborate on the MVTEC AD dataset, stating that it includes various textures and objects. This section confirms the importance of this dataset for their research.

In the **related works section**, the authors reference the MVTEC AD dataset again, providing additional context about its use in unsupervised anomaly detection. This reinforces the significance of the dataset in their study.

I will then look for any other datasets mentioned in the **methodology or experiments sections**. The authors indicate that they created a **custom fabric dataset** based on various fabric types and qualities, which is crucial for their proposed method. This dataset is essential for understanding their approach to fabric anomaly detection.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to gather full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. For the **MVTEC AD dataset**, the citation is:
   > P. Bergmann, M. Fauser, D. Sattlegger, and C. Steger. “MVTec AD — A Comprehensive Real-World Dataset for Unsupervised Anomaly Detection”. In: 2019 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR). Long Beach, CA, USA: IEEE, June 2019, pp. 9584–9592.

2. For the **custom fabric dataset**, the authors reference it as being based on various fabric datasets, but they do not provide a specific citation for it. However, they mention that it is created for fabric anomaly detection, which is important to note.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

- **Dataset 1**: MVTEC AD
  - Description: A comprehensive dataset that includes various textures and objects used for unsupervised anomaly detection.
  - Citation: Bergmann et al. (2019).

- **Dataset 2**: Custom Fabric Dataset
  - Description: A dataset created specifically for fabric anomaly detection, encompassing different categories of textures with varying quality and homogeneity.
  - Citation: Not explicitly provided in the paper.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations.
