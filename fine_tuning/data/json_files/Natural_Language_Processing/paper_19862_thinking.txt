To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Policy Space Response Oracles: A Survey" by Ariyan Bighashdel et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract and introduction** sections. These sections often provide a high-level overview of the research and may mention key datasets used in the study. In this case, the abstract does not explicitly mention any datasets, so I will proceed to the introduction.

Next, I will examine the **main body of the paper**, particularly focusing on sections that discuss experiments, applications, or methodologies. I will look for any references to datasets used for empirical analysis or case studies. 

As I read through the paper, I will pay special attention to sections that discuss applications of the PSRO framework, as these often include datasets used in various domains. For instance, the authors mention applications in security games, bargaining games, and other real-world scenarios. I will note any specific datasets mentioned in these contexts.

After identifying potential datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like "Google Research Football environments," I will look for the corresponding citation in the references. If the dataset is not directly cited, I will note the context in which it was used and any relevant details provided in the text.

Once I have compiled a list of datasets along with their descriptions and citations, I will ensure that each entry is clear and concise, providing enough detail for someone unfamiliar with the paper to understand the significance of each dataset.

Finally, I will organize the extracted information into a structured format, ready for further processing or review, ensuring that all citations are complete and accurate.
