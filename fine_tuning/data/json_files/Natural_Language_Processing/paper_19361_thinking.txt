To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning to Retrieve for Job Matching" by Jianqiang Shen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the application of learning-to-retrieve technology but does not specify any datasets. The introduction provides context about LinkedIn's job search and recommendation systems but also does not mention specific datasets.

Next, I will examine the **methodology and experiments sections**. These sections often contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used for training and evaluation. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

In the **experiments section**, the authors describe their evaluation methods and metrics. They mention using "confirmed hire data" to construct a graph for evaluating seeker qualifications for jobs. This indicates that they are using a specific dataset related to job applications and hires, but they do not provide a formal name for this dataset.

I will also check the **references section** for any datasets that might have been cited in previous works. The references include various papers that may have used datasets relevant to job matching or recommendation systems. However, I will need to ensure that I identify which of these references correspond to datasets used in this specific study.

After reviewing the entire paper, I will compile the information I have gathered about the datasets. Since the paper primarily discusses the use of confirmed hire data without naming specific datasets, I will note that the dataset used is derived from LinkedIn's internal data on job applications and hires.

Finally, I will write the full citation for the paper itself, as it is essential to provide proper attribution for the dataset information I have extracted.

The citation for the paper is:

Learning to Retrieve for Job Matching. In Proceedings of ACM KDD 2024 (KDD). ACM, New York, NY, USA, 11 pages. https://doi.org/XXXXXXX.XXXXXXX

In summary, the key dataset extracted is the "confirmed hire data" from LinkedIn, which is used for evaluating job seeker qualifications, but no specific dataset names are provided in the paper. I will ensure to document this appropriately in my final output.
