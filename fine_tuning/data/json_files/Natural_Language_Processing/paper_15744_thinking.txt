To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Transduce and Speak: Neural Transducer for Text-to-Speech with Semantic Token Prediction" by Minchan Kim et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental settings sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges faced by neural TTS systems and the proposed solution, but they do not mention specific datasets yet. I will need to look further into the **experimental settings** section.

In **section 3.1 (Dataset)**, the authors specify that they conducted their experiments on the **LibriTTS corpus**. They mention using the train subsets of LibriTTS (train-clean-100, train-clean-360, train-other-500), which collectively contain about 555 hours of labeled speech recorded by 2311 speakers. They also state that the evaluation was done on the test-clean subset, which consists of about 8 hours of speech with 39 speakers not overlapping with the training set.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the LibriTTS dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:

- For **LibriTTS**, the citation is:
  > Heiga Zen, Viet Dang, Rob Clark, Yu Zhang, Ron J. Weiss, Ye Jia, Zhifeng Chen, and Yonghui Wu. *LibriTTS: A Corpus Derived from LibriSpeech for Text-to-Speech*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP), pages 1526â€“1530, 2019.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the findings:

1. **LibriTTS**: The dataset used for training and evaluation in the experiments, which includes various subsets for training and testing.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format for further processing or review.
