To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Neural Approaches to Multilingual Information Retrieval" by Dawn Lawrie et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the datasets that might be referenced. The abstract mentions the use of **MS MARCO** for fine-tuning, which indicates that this dataset is likely important for the experiments.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments** section. In this paper, there is a **Table 1** that provides statistics for the **CLEF 2001, 2002, and 2003** datasets, which are used for evaluating multilingual information retrieval. This table lists the number of relevant documents and the total number of documents for different languages, confirming that these datasets are utilized in the research.

I will also check the **experiments section** where the authors discuss their methodology and the datasets used for training and evaluation. They mention using **MS MARCO** and its multilingual version, **mMARCO**, for fine-tuning their models. This indicates that both datasets are crucial for their experiments.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper from the **References section**:

1. **MS MARCO**:
   > Bajaj, P., Campos, D., Craswell, N., Deng, L., Gao, J., Liu, X., Majumder, R., McNamara, A., Mitra, B., Nguyen, T., et al. *MS MARCO: A human generated machine reading comprehension dataset*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1611.09268, 2016.

2. **mMARCO**:
   > Bonifacio, L.H., Jeronymo, V., Abonizio, H.Q., Campiotti, I., Fadaee, M., Lotufo, R., Nogueira, R. *mMARCO: A multilingual version of MS MARCO passage ranking dataset*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2108.13897, 2021.

3. **CLEF 2001, 2002, and 2003**:
   > Braschler, M. *CLEF 2001—overview of results*. In: Workshop of the Cross-Language Evaluation Forum for European Languages, pp. 9–26, Springer, 2001.
   > Braschler, M. *CLEF 2002—overview of results*. In: Workshop of the Cross-Language Evaluation Forum for European Languages, pp. 9–27, Springer, 2002.
   > Braschler, M. *CLEF 2003–overview of results*. In: Workshop of the Cross-Language Evaluation Forum for European Languages, pp. 44–63, Springer, 2003.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
