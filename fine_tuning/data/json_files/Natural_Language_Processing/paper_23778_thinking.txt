To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Improving the realism of robotic surgery simulation through injection of learning-based estimated errors" by Juan Antonio Barragan et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the development of algorithms for robotic surgery simulation and mentions data collected from a physical robot, which suggests that there may be datasets involved.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, where the authors describe how they collected data for training their neural networks. They mention collecting a dataset consisting of setpoint poses (S1), measured poses (M1), and actual poses (A1) from the da Vinci Research Kit (dVRK). This indicates that there is a specific dataset related to the robotic surgery simulation.

In the **experimental results section**, the authors detail how they tested their framework on the dVRK and collected data for training the neural networks. They mention that the dataset was generated by moving the robot through multiple joint configurations and recording the poses. This reinforces the existence of a dataset used in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. The paper references the da Vinci Research Kit (dVRK) as the platform used for data collection. The relevant citation for the dVRK is:

- For the da Vinci Research Kit (dVRK):
  > P. Kazanzides, Z. Chen, A. Deguet, G. S. Fischer, R. H. Taylor, and S. P. DiMaio. *An open-source research kit for the da Vinci® Surgical System*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA), pages 6434–6439, 2014.

Additionally, the authors mention using an optical tracker for pose estimation, which may also be relevant. The citation for the optical tracker is:

- For the optical tracker:
  > E. Ayvali. *Pose estimation for sensor calibration*. GitHub repository, 2024. Available: https://github.com/eayvali/Pose-Estimation-for-Sensor-Calibration.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
