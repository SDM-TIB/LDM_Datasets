To extract datasets from the research paper titled "EchoMamba4Rec: Harmonizing Bidirectional State Space Models with Spectral Filtering for Advanced Sequential Recommendation" by Yuda Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research but may not specify datasets. The introduction often discusses the context and significance of the research, which might include references to datasets.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, as this section typically contains detailed information about the datasets used in the study. Here, the authors mention three datasets: 

1. **Amazon-Beauty**: This dataset contains product reviews and ratings specifically for beauty products on Amazon.
2. **Amazon-Video-Games**: Similar to the previous dataset, this one focuses on product reviews and ratings for video games on Amazon.
3. **MovieLens-1M**: This dataset consists of movie ratings from the MovieLens platform.

The paper provides a summary of the statistics for each dataset, including the number of users, items, interactions, and average interaction length per user. This information is crucial for understanding the datasets' scope and relevance.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are essential for proper attribution and further exploration of the datasets.

The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **Amazon-Beauty** and **Amazon-Video-Games**, the citation is:
  > Ni, J., Li, J., McAuley, J. (2019). Justifying recommendations using distantly-labeled reviews and fine-grained aspects. In Proceedings of the 2019 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing and the 9th International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing (EMNLP-IJCNLP), pp. 188–197.

- For **MovieLens-1M**, the citation is:
  > Umemoto, K. (2022). ML-1M++: Movielens-compatible additional preferences for more robust offline evaluation of sequential recommenders. In Proceedings of the 31st ACM International Conference on Information & Knowledge Management, pp. 4540–4544.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or analysis.
