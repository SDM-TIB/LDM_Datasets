To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DRSI-Net: Dual-Residual Spatial Interaction Network for Multi-Person Pose Estimation" by Shang Wu and Bin Wang, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the proposed method was evaluated on the **COCO dataset**, which is a well-known benchmark for keypoint detection. This suggests that the dataset is significant for the experiments conducted.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (specifically section 4.1) where the authors describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they explicitly mention the **MS COCO dataset** as the dataset used for their experiments. They provide details about the dataset, including its size and the types of annotations available.

The paper states that the COCO dataset contains over 200K images with 250K human instances, and each instance is labeled with bounding box coordinates and 17 keypoints. This information is crucial for understanding the dataset's relevance to multi-person pose estimation.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citation for the COCO dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:

> T. Y. Lin, M. Maire, S. Belongie, J. Hays, P. Perona, D. Ramanan, P. Dollar, and C. L. Zitnick. *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. Computer Vision - ECCV 2014, Pt V, vol. 8693, pp. 740-755, 2014.

Having identified the dataset and its citation, I will compile the information into a structured format that highlights the dataset's name, description, and citation.

In summary, the steps I took to extract the dataset information are as follows:
1. Read the abstract and introduction to identify mentions of datasets.
2. Review the experiments section for explicit details about the datasets used.
3. Note the description and significance of the **MS COCO dataset**.
4. Retrieve the full citation for the dataset from the references section.

Now, I will prepare the dataset entry based on the information gathered.
