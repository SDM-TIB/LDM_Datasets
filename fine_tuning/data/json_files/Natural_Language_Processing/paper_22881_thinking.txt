To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CoLay: Controllable Layout Generation through Multi-conditional Latent Diffusion" by Chin-Yi Cheng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the use of the **CLAY** and **C4** datasets, which indicates that these are the primary datasets of interest.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors discuss the datasets in detail. In section 3.1, they explicitly state that they conduct experiments using two publicly available datasets: **CLAY** and **C4**. I will take note of the specifications provided for each dataset, including their types, sizes, and attributes.

1. **CLAY Dataset**: The paper describes it as a UI dataset with 50,000 layouts, containing 5 attributes and an average of 19.62 elements per layout. The resolution is specified as 36x64 pixels.

2. **C4 Dataset**: This dataset is characterized as a web dataset with 5 million layouts, containing 16 attributes and an average of 37.71 elements per layout. The resolution is specified as 1024x1024 pixels.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The paper cites the datasets as follows:

- For **CLAY**, the citation is:
  > Gang Li, Gilles Baechler, Manuel Tragut, and Yang Li. *Learning to denoise raw mobile UI layouts for improving datasets at scale*. In CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, pages 1–13, 2022.

- For **C4**, the citation is:
  > Colin Raffel, Noam Shazeer, Adam Roberts, Katherine Lee, Sharan Narang, Michael Matena, Yanqi Zhou, Wei Li, and Peter J. Liu. *Exploring the limits of transfer learning with a unified text-to-text transformer*. Journal of Machine Learning Research, 21(140):1–67, 2020.

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, type, size, attributes, and the full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately represent the datasets used in the research paper.
