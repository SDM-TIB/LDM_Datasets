To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Lib-SibGMU - A University Library Circulation Dataset for Recommender Systems Development" by Mikhail Arhipkin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the datasets discussed. The abstract mentions that the authors have open-sourced a university library circulation dataset called **Lib-SibGMU**, which is a strong indication that this is the primary dataset of interest.

Next, I will examine **section 3 (The Dataset)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the **Lib-SibGMU dataset**. They describe how the dataset was obtained from the circulation history database of a medical school library, including the structure of the data, the number of entries, and the types of information included (e.g., user IDs, book IDs, circulation dates). This section confirms that **Lib-SibGMU** is the main dataset being introduced.

I will also check the **References section** to find any citations related to the dataset. However, since the dataset is newly introduced and open-sourced by the authors themselves, it may not have an external citation. Instead, I will note the authors' own description and the link provided for accessing the dataset.

The dataset is available at the following URL:

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring to include the full citation for the dataset as follows:

- **Dataset Name**: Lib-SibGMU
- **Description**: An anonymized university library circulation dataset containing records of users' interactions with the library, including details such as user IDs, book IDs, and circulation dates.
- **Citation**: Mikhail Arhipkin, Dmitry Menshikov, Eduard Zubchuk, Aleksandr Karaush, Nikolay Mikhaylovskiy. *Lib-SibGMU - A University Library Circulation Dataset for Recommender Systems Development*. Available at: https://github.com/NTRLab/Lib-SibGMU-recommendation-dataset

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entry for further processing or review.
