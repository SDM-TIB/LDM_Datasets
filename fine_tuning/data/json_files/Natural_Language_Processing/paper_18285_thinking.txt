To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Consistency Guided Knowledge Retrieval and Denoising in LLMs for Zero-shot Document-level Relation Triplet Extraction" by Qi Sun et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors perform experiments on **two public datasets**, which indicates that datasets are indeed involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets and Settings)**, where the authors explicitly state the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention:

1. **DocRED**: This is described as a large-scale human-annotated document-level relation extraction dataset with 96 pre-defined relation types, constructed from Wikipedia and Wikidata.

2. **Re-DocRED**: This is a revised version of the DocRED dataset, which supplements positive instances that were ignored in the original DocRED dataset.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **DocRED**, the citation is:
  > Yuan Yao, Deming Ye, Peng Li, Xu Han, Yankai Lin, Zhenghao Liu, Zhiyuan Liu, Lixin Huang, Jie Zhou, and Maosong Sun. *DocRED: A Large-Scale Document-Level Relation Extraction Dataset*. In Proceedings of ACL, pages 764–777, 2019. https://aclanthology.org/P19-1074

- For **Re-DocRED**, the citation is:
  > Qingyu Tan, Lu Xu, Lidong Bing, Hwee Tou Ng, and Sharifah Mahani Aljunied. *Revisiting DocRED – Addressing the False Negative Problem in Relation Extraction*. In Proceedings of EMNLP, 2022. https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.12696

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use.

In summary, the datasets extracted from the paper are:
1. **DocRED**
2. **Re-DocRED**

I will ensure that the full citations for each dataset are accurately recorded for reference.
