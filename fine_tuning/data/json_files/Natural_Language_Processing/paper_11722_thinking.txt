To extract datasets from the research paper titled "H2O: Heavy-Hitter Oracle for Efficient Generative Inference of Large Language Models" by Zhenyu Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for validation or experimentation.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. This section often contains detailed information about the datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics. I will look for any tables or figures that summarize the datasets as well.

In this paper, the authors mention several datasets in the context of their experiments. I will note down the names of these datasets and any relevant details provided in the text. For instance, they might mention datasets like **COPA**, **OpenBookQA**, **MathQA**, **PiQA**, **RTE**, and **Winogrande**.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily. I will look for the original papers or sources where these datasets were introduced or described.

For example, if the paper cites the **COPA dataset**, I will find the original citation, which might look something like:
> Melissa Roemmele, Cosmin Adrian Bejan, and Andrew S Gordon. *Choice of Plausible Alternatives: An Evaluation of Commonsense Causal Reasoning*. In AAAI Spring Symposium: Logical Formalizations of Commonsense Reasoning, pages 90â€“95, 2011.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset names along with their full citations into a structured format for clarity and ease of use.

Finally, I will ensure that I have accurately captured all relevant details about each dataset, including its purpose, size, and any specific characteristics mentioned in the paper. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.
