To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An Interpretable and Attention-based Method for Gaze Estimation Using Electroencephalography" by Nina Weng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections for any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors leverage a large dataset of simultaneously measured EEG and eye tracking data, which suggests that a specific dataset is being utilized.

Next, I will look closely at **section 3 (Experiments and Results)**, where the authors describe their experimental setup. Here, they explicitly mention the **EEGEyeNet dataset** as the dataset used for their experiments. I will gather details about this dataset, including its structure and the types of data it contains.

In the description of the **EEGEyeNet dataset**, the authors provide information about the data collection process, including the number of subjects, the types of tasks (Position Task and Direction Task), and the nature of the data (EEG and eye-tracking). This section is crucial as it provides insights into how the dataset is organized and what kind of information it holds.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the EEGEyeNet dataset. The relevant citation provided in the paper is:

> Kastrati, A., PÅ‚omecka, M.M.B., Pascual, D., Wolf, L., Gillioz, V., Wattenhofer, R., Langer, N. (2021). *EEGEyeNet: A simultaneous electroencephalography and eye-tracking dataset and benchmark for eye movement prediction*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2111.05100.

This citation will be essential for accurately documenting the dataset.

After gathering all this information, I will summarize the findings about the dataset, ensuring to include the dataset name, description, and the full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the dataset used in the research paper.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format for easy reference and further processing.
