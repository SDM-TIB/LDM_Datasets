To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Morphological Skip-Gram: Using Morphological Knowledge to Improve Word Representation" by Flávio A. Oliveira Santos et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss various applications of word embeddings and mention the need for intrinsic evaluations across different tasks. This suggests that datasets will be referenced later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Evaluation and Discussion)**, where the authors detail their experiments. Here, they mention using **15 different datasets** for intrinsic evaluations, categorized into three types: Similarity, Analogy, and Categorization. This section is crucial as it lists the datasets used for evaluation.

The paper provides a summary table (Table 2) that outlines the datasets along with their categories and metrics used for evaluation. The datasets mentioned are:

1. **SimLex999**: A dataset for measuring semantic similarity.
2. **MEN**: Another dataset for semantic similarity evaluation.
3. **WordSimilarity353**: A dataset for assessing word similarity.
4. **Rare Words**: A dataset focused on rare word evaluation.
5. **RG65**: A dataset for semantic similarity.
6. **Turk**: A dataset for word similarity.
7. **Google**: A dataset for analogy tasks.
8. **MSR**: A dataset for analogy tasks.
9. **SemEval 2012.2**: A dataset for analogy tasks.
10. **AP**: A dataset for categorization tasks.
11. **BLESS**: A dataset for categorization tasks.
12. **BATTING**: A dataset for categorization tasks.

Next, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The paper may not provide explicit citations for all datasets, but I will look for any references that might lead to the original sources of these datasets.

For example, the citations for some datasets might be:

- **SimLex999**: 
  > Felix Hill, Roi Reichart, and Anna Korhonen. "Simlex-999: Evaluating semantic models with (genuine) similarity estimation." *Computational Linguistics*, 41(4):665–695, 2015.

- **MEN**: 
  > Elia Bruni, Nam-Khanh Tran, and Marco Baroni. "Multimodal distributional semantics." *Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research*, 49:1–47, 2014.

- **Google**: 
  > Tomas Mikolov, Kai Chen, Greg Corrado, and Jeffrey Dean. "Efficient estimation of word representations in vector space." arXiv preprint arXiv:1301.3781, 2013.

I will continue this process for each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring that I gather accurate and complete citations.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, including their names, categories, and full citations, into a structured format that can be easily reviewed or processed further. This will ensure that all relevant information is captured and documented appropriately.
