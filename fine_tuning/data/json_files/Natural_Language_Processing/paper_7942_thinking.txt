To extract datasets from the research paper titled "E-BRANCHFORMER: BRANCHFORMER WITH ENHANCED MERGING FOR SPEECH RECOGNITION" by Kwangyoun Kim et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that the authors achieved state-of-the-art word error rates (WERs) on the **LibriSpeech test-clean and test-other sets**, indicating that the LibriSpeech dataset is used.

Next, I will check the **experiments section** for more details about the datasets. In section 5.1, the authors explicitly state that they conduct experiments mainly on the **LibriSpeech dataset**, which contains approximately 1000 hours of transcribed speech. This confirms that LibriSpeech is the primary dataset used for their experiments.

I will also look into the **References section** to find the full citation for the LibriSpeech dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Vassil Panayotov, Guoguo Chen, Daniel Povey, and Sanjeev Khudanpur. *Librispeech: an ASR corpus based on public domain audio books*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP), 2015.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets, I will compile the information regarding the LibriSpeech dataset into the required format.

Finally, I will ensure that the dataset entry is complete and ready for review or further processing.
