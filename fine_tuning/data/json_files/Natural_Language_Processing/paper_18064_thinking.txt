To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Cross-lingual Offensive Language Detection: A Systematic Review of Datasets, Transfer Approaches and Challenges" by Aiqi Jiang and Arkaitz Zubiaga, I will follow a structured approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the paper reviews various datasets used in cross-lingual offensive language detection, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Multilingual Hate Speech Datasets)**, as it is explicitly dedicated to summarizing the datasets utilized in the surveyed studies. This section provides a table that lists 82 datasets, including their characteristics such as the year of release, topic, source, language, size, and availability.

I will extract the relevant details for each dataset mentioned in the table. For instance, I will note the following datasets:

1. **KOLD (Korean Offensive Language Dataset)**: Released in 2022, it focuses on offensive language detection in Korean and contains 40,429 instances sourced from social media.

2. **COLD (Chinese Offensive Language Detection)**: Also released in 2022, this dataset includes 62,600 instances and is aimed at detecting offensive language in Chinese.

3. **Dravidiancodemix**: This dataset is designed for sentiment analysis and offensive language identification in Dravidian languages, released in 2022, with a size of 8,541 instances.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for the datasets used in the research.

For example, the citation for the **KOLD dataset** is:
> Younghoon Jeong, Juhyun Oh, Jongwon Lee, Jaimeen Ahn, Jihyung Moon, Sungjoon Park, and Alice Oh. *KOLD: Korean Offensive Language Dataset*. In Proceedings of the EMNLP, 2022.

Similarly, I will find the citations for **COLD** and **Dravidiancodemix**.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation, ready for structured output or further processing.
