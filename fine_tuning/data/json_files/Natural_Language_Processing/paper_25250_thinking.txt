To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Dual-Attention Aware Deep Convolutional Neural Network for Early Alzheimerâ€™s Detection," I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention the use of neuroimaging data for classifying Alzheimer's disease, which suggests that datasets related to neuroimaging are involved. I will look for specific dataset names in this section.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly the subsection titled "Dataset Exploration." Here, the authors explicitly mention the use of the **OASIS-1 dataset**, which contains cross-sectional MRI data from various age groups, including both demented and non-demented individuals. They describe the dataset's composition, including the number of subjects and the types of scans available.

Additionally, the authors refer to the **Augmented Alzheimer MRI Dataset** to address class imbalance issues in the OASIS dataset. This dataset is crucial for understanding how the authors improved their model's performance.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **OASIS-1 dataset**, the citation is:
   > Marcus, D. S., Wang, T. H., Parker, J., Csernansky, J. G., Morris, J. C., & Buckner, R. L. (2007). Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS): Cross-sectional MRI data in young, middle-aged, nondemented, and demented older adults. *Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience*, 19(9), 1498-1507. doi:10.1162/jocn.2007.19.9.1498

2. For the **Augmented Alzheimer MRI Dataset**, the citation is:
   > Uraninjo. (2024). Augmented Alzheimer MRI Dataset. Retrieved from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uraninjo/augmented-alzheimer-mri-dataset/data

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This structured approach will help in organizing the datasets for further analysis or processing.
