To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An Attention-Based Denoising Framework for Personality Detection in Social Media Texts" by Qirui Tang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors achieved state-of-the-art performance on two commonly used datasets, which suggests that these datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **related studies** and **method** sections, as these are likely to contain explicit mentions of the datasets used for personality detection. In the related studies section, the authors mention two datasets: **Essays-Big Five Personality Traits (Essays-BigFive)** and **Twitter-MBTI**. 

In the **method** section, the authors provide a detailed description of these datasets:

1. **Essays-BigFive Dataset**: This dataset consists of 2,468 stream-of-consciousness essays written by students, annotated with self-reports of a 5-factor measure. It is noted that this dataset is not directly collected from social media but matches the characteristics of social media texts. The dataset is available on Kaggle.

2. **Twitter-MBTI Dataset**: This dataset includes 8,675 groups of tweets along with MBTI labels, where each group comprises the last 50 tweets posted by a user. This dataset is also available on Kaggle and has permission for academic use.

To ensure I have the correct citations, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **Essays-BigFive Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Majumder, N., Poria, S., Gelbukh, A., & Cambria, E. (2017). Deep learning-based document modeling for personality detection from text. *IEEE Intelligent Systems*, 32(2), 74-79.

- For the **Twitter-MBTI Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Keh, S. S., Cheng, I., et al. (2019). Myers-Briggs personality classification and personality-specific language generation using pre-trained language models. *arXiv:1907.06333*.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations.
