To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Holistic Review on Advanced Bi-directional EV Charging Control Algorithms" by Xiaoying Tang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections of the paper. These sections often provide a summary of the research focus and may mention any datasets used for analysis or case studies. In this case, the abstract discusses the evolution of electric vehicles and their integration with smart grid technologies, but does not explicitly mention any datasets.

Next, I will examine the **methodology and case study sections**. These sections typically detail the experiments conducted and may reference specific datasets used for simulations or analyses. In the provided text, there is a mention of a case study that utilizes data from "All CHM Plotted Routes, District of Columbia," which records geographic coordinates and connections between waypoints. This indicates that a dataset is indeed referenced.

I will then look for any **figures or tables** that might summarize data or datasets used in the research. The paper includes figures that illustrate the transportation network and charging stations, but I need to ensure that any datasets mentioned are explicitly cited.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper references the dataset used in the case study as follows:

- For the dataset "All CHM Plotted Routes, District of Columbia," the citation is:
  > "All CHM Plotted Routes, District of Columbia." Available at: http://courses.teresco.org/chm/viewer/?load=../graphs/dc-all-nomerge.gra

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets explicitly, I will compile the identified dataset into a structured format, ensuring that the citation is included.

Finally, I will summarize the findings and prepare the dataset entry for review or further processing, ensuring that all necessary details are captured accurately.
