To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Planning to Learn: A Novel Algorithm for Active Learning during Model-Based Planning" by Rowan Hodson et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the work, which may include references to datasets used for evaluation or comparison.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **experiments**. In many research papers, authors will explicitly describe the datasets they used in a specific section, often labeled as "Datasets," "Data Collection," or "Experimental Setup." This section typically contains detailed information about the datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

If the paper includes a **methods section**, I will examine it closely, as it may provide additional context about how the datasets were utilized in the experiments. This section might also reference previous works or datasets that are foundational to the current research.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** of the paper to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. I will ensure that I capture the complete citation format, including authors, title, publication venue, and year.

For this specific paper, I will look for any datasets mentioned in the context of the novel algorithm being tested. If the authors refer to any established datasets or benchmarks, I will note those as well.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented and properly cited.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for easy reference, ensuring that all information is clear and accessible for future use.
