To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Auditable Algorithms for Approximate Model Counting" by Kuldeep S. Meel, Supratik Chakraborty, and S. Akshay, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, but it may not explicitly mention datasets. The introduction often discusses related work and may reference datasets used in prior studies.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **experiments**. In this paper, I will specifically check sections that describe the algorithms and their evaluations, as these sections typically detail the datasets used for testing the proposed methods.

Upon reviewing the paper, I will note any datasets mentioned, including their names, descriptions, and any relevant details such as the number of instances, types of data, and specific characteristics that are highlighted by the authors.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets themselves.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like "SATLIB," I would look for its citation in the references, which might be formatted as follows:
> "SATLIB: A Library for the Evaluation of SAT Solvers." Available at: [URL or DOI].

If the paper discusses multiple datasets, I will repeat this process for each one, ensuring that I capture all relevant information.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including their full citations, into a structured format that can be easily reviewed or processed further.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets referenced in the paper, maintaining a focus on clarity and completeness in the citations.
