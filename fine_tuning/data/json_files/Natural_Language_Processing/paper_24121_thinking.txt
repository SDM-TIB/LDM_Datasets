To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Bridging Local Details and Global Context in Text-Attributed Graphs" by Yaoke Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the paper's focus and any datasets mentioned. In the introduction, the authors mention evaluating their method on several widely used textual graphs, which indicates that datasets will be discussed in detail later.

Next, I will navigate to **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention seven datasets:

1. **Cora**: This dataset contains 2,708 scientific publications classified into seven classes, with a total of 5,429 edges.
2. **WikiCS**: A Wikipedia-based dataset with 10 computer science branches as classes, designed for benchmarking Graph Neural Networks.
3. **CiteSeer**: Comprising 3,186 scientific publications categorized into six areas, with the task of classifying each paper based on its title and abstract.
4. **ArXiv-2023**: A directed graph representing the citation network of computer science arXiv papers published in 2023 or later, with 40 subject areas for classification.
5. **Ele-Photo**: Derived from the AmazonElectronics dataset, consisting of electronics products with edges indicating frequent co-purchases or co-views, classified into 12 categories.
6. **OGBN-Products**: A subset of a larger dataset, representing Amazon products with edges denoting co-purchases, categorized into 47 top-level categories.
7. **OGBN-ArXiv**: A directed graph depicting the citation network among computer science arXiv papers, with 40 subject areas for classification.

After identifying these datasets, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their full citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
