To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CPT: Competence-progressive Training Strategy for Few-shot Node Classification" by Qilong Yan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on "four prevalent real-world graph datasets," which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they list four datasets:

1. **Amazon-E**: The authors reference this dataset and provide statistics about it, including the number of nodes, edges, and features.

2. **DBLP**: This dataset is also mentioned with its corresponding statistics, indicating its relevance to the experiments conducted.

3. **Cora-full**: The authors provide details about this dataset as well, including its structure and the number of classes used for training and testing.

4. **OGBN-arxiv**: This dataset is included in the list, and the authors provide similar statistics as for the other datasets.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **Amazon-E**, the citation is:
  > Julian McAuley, Rahul Pandey, and Jure Leskovec. *Inferring networks of substitutable and complementary products*. arXiv: Social and Information Networks, Jun 2015.

- For **DBLP**, the citation is:
  > Jie Tang, Jing Zhang, Limin Yao, Juanzi Li, Li Zhang, and Zhong Su. *Arnetminer*. In Proceedings of the 14th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, Aug 2008.

- For **Cora-full**, the citation is:
  > Aleksandar Bojchevski and Stephan GÂ¨unnemann. *Deep gaussian embedding of graphs: Unsupervised inductive learning via ranking*. Cornell University - arXiv, Jul 2017.

- For **OGBN-arxiv**, the citation is:
  > Weihua Hu, Matthias Fey, Marinka Zitnik, Yuxiao Dong, Hongyu Ren, Bowen Liu, Michele Catasta, and Jure Leskovec. *Open graph benchmark: Datasets for machine learning on graphs*. Cornell University - arXiv, May 2020.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their full citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the necessary details for each dataset mentioned in the paper.
