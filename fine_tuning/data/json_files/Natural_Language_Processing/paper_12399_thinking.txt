To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Zero-shot and Few-shot Study of Instruction-Finetuned Large Language Models Applied to Clinical and Biomedical Tasks" by Yanis Labrak et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental protocol sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides an overview of the study's focus on evaluating instruction-tuned LLMs on clinical and biomedical tasks, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

Next, I will examine **section 3 (Experimental Protocol)**, where the authors describe the models and datasets used for benchmarking. This section is crucial as it typically lists the datasets explicitly.

In **section 3.2 (Downstream evaluation tasks)**, the authors provide a table (Table 1) that lists the evaluation tasks along with their corresponding datasets. The datasets mentioned include:

1. **HoC**: Used for classification tasks.
2. **LitCovid**: Used for question-answering tasks.
3. **PubHealth**: Used for relation extraction tasks.
4. **N2C2 2006 Smokers**: Used for natural language inference tasks.
5. **BioASQ 7b**: Used for question-answering tasks.
6. **MedMCQA**: Used for question-answering tasks.
7. **SciQ**: Used for question-answering tasks.
8. **Evidence Inference 2.0**: Used for relation extraction tasks.
9. **GAD**: Used for relation extraction tasks.
10. **SciTail**: Used for natural language inference tasks.
11. **MedNLI**: Used for natural language inference tasks.
12. **BC5CDR**: Used for named-entity recognition tasks.
13. **NCBI-disease**: Used for named-entity recognition tasks.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are essential for proper attribution and to provide context for each dataset.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
