To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-layered tensor networks for image classification" by Raghavendra Selvan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, method, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and while it may not explicitly mention datasets, it sets the context for the experiments that follow. The introduction will likely provide insights into the datasets used for the experiments.

In the **experiments section**, I will focus on the subsection titled **3.1 Data**, where the authors describe the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention the **LIDC-IDRI dataset**, which consists of 1018 thoracic CT images with lesions annotated by four radiologists. This section also details how the dataset was processed, including the extraction of 128x128 pixel 2D slices, resulting in a total of 15,096 patches.

Next, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the LIDC-IDRI dataset. The citation provided in the references is:

- For the **LIDC-IDRI dataset**, the citation is:
  > Samuel G Armato III, Geoffrey McLennan, Michael F McNitt-Gray, Charles R Meyer, David Yankelevitz, Denise R Aberle, Claudia I Henschke, Eric A Hoffman, Ella A Kazerooni, Heber MacMahon, et al. *Lung image database consortium: developing a resource for the medical imaging research community*. Radiology, 232(3):739â€“748, 2004.

Since the paper primarily discusses the LIDC-IDRI dataset, I will ensure to document this dataset thoroughly, including its description and citation.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and citation, ready for further processing or review.
