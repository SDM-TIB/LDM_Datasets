To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Importance Sampling-Guided Meta-Training for Intelligent Agents in Highly Interactive Environments" by Mansur M. Arief et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments with both a synthetic dataset and the InD dataset, which suggests that these are the datasets I need to focus on.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. The authors state that they used a **synthetic dataset** for initial experiments and the **InD dataset** for real-world evaluations. I will need to gather more details about these datasets.

In the **experiments section**, the authors describe the use of the **InD dataset**, specifically mentioning that it includes T-intersection scenarios. They reference the dataset in the context of learning driving behaviors from real-world data. This confirms that the InD dataset is a key dataset used in their research.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The InD dataset is cited as follows:
- For the **InD dataset**, the citation is:
  > Bock, J., Krajewski, R., Moers, T., Runde, S., Vater, L., & Eckstein, L. (2019). *The inD dataset: A drone dataset of naturalistic road user trajectories at German intersections*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV), 1929â€“1934.

The synthetic dataset is not explicitly cited in the references, as it appears to be a constructed dataset for the purpose of the experiments. Therefore, I will note that it is a synthetic dataset used for illustrative purposes without a formal citation.

Now, I will summarize the datasets identified:
1. **Synthetic Dataset**: Used for initial experiments to illustrate the framework's capabilities. No formal citation is available.
2. **InD Dataset**: A real-world dataset used for evaluating the proposed method in naturalistic driving scenarios.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for review or further processing, ensuring that I include the full citation for the InD dataset and note the synthetic dataset's lack of citation.
