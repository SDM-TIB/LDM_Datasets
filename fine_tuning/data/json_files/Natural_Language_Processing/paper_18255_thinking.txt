To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Modular Control of Biological Networks" by David Murrugarra et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's focus, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets or experiments**. In this paper, it is likely that the authors describe the datasets they used for their analysis, particularly in the context of Boolean network models and their applications in biological systems.

I will pay close attention to any specific names of datasets mentioned, such as "Boolean network model of blood cancer large granular lymphocyte (T-LGL) leukemia," as this indicates a dataset that may be referenced later in the paper.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets themselves.

For example, if the paper references a dataset related to T-LGL leukemia, I will ensure to find the original source or publication that describes this dataset in detail.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for output, ensuring that they are clear and ready for any further processing or review.
