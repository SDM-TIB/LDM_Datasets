To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Expert Embedding using Dominating Set Theory with Deep Learning Approaches" by Narjes Nikzad-Khasmakhi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments on common datasets and their collected data from Scopus. This indicates that there are at least two datasets involved: one from Scopus and others that are common datasets used in the field.

Next, I will look into **section 4 (Data Description)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention that they gathered a collaborative network from Scopus, which includes various features of authors such as subject areas, affiliations, h-index, and co-author interactions. This section is likely to contain specific details about the Scopus dataset.

In addition, I will check **section 5 (Experimental Evaluation)**, where the authors summarize the datasets used for their experiments. They mention several datasets, including:

1. **BlogCatalog**: A social blog directory where nodes represent bloggers and edges represent friendships. Each blogger is labeled by at least one category representing their interests.
   
2. **Protein-Protein Interactions (PPI)**: A biological network where nodes are proteins and edges indicate physical interactions between proteins in humans.

3. **Wikipedia**: A network of co-occurrence words related to Wikipedia articles, with node labels indicating Part-of-Speech (POS) tags.

4. **arXiv (Astro-PH)**: A collaborative network constructed from collaborations between authors' papers submitted to the arXiv in the Astro Physics category.

5. **Scopus**: The dataset collected from Scopus, which includes a co-author network formed by crawling author profiles.

After identifying these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For the **BlogCatalog dataset**, the citation is:
> Zafarani, R., & Liu, H. (2009). Social computing data repository at ASU.

For the **PPI dataset**, the citation is:
> Chatr-Aryamontri, A., et al. (2017). The BioGRID interaction database: 2017 update. Nucleic Acids Research.

For the **Wikipedia dataset**, the citation is:
> Mahoney, M. (2011). Large text compression benchmark. URL: http://www.mattmahoney.net/text/text.html.

For the **arXiv (Astro-PH) dataset**, the citation is:
> Leskovec, J., & Krevl, A. (2014). Snap datasets: Stanford large network dataset collection.

For the **Scopus dataset**, the citation is:
> Nikzad-Khasmakhi, N., Balafar, M., & Feizi-Derakhshi, M. R. (2021). Expert Embedding using Dominating Set Theory with Deep Learning Approaches. Journal of Expert Systems With Applications.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described clearly and includes its full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I capture all relevant information about the datasets used in the research paper.
