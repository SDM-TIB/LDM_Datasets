To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Survey on Multimodal Wearable Sensor-based Human Action Recognition" by Jianyuan Ni et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract provides a general overview, but the introduction often contains specific references to datasets used in the research.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Multimodal Human Activity Recognition)**, as it is likely to contain detailed descriptions of the datasets utilized in the study. In this section, the authors mention several datasets, including:

1. **MMAct**: A large-scale dataset for multimodal human action recognition, which includes various sensor modalities.
2. **EPIC-KITCHENS-100**: A dataset that contains videos of kitchen activities, annotated for action recognition.
3. **Berkeley MHAD**: A comprehensive multimodal human action database that includes depth and wearable sensor data.
4. **UTD-MHAD**: A dataset that combines depth camera and wearable inertial sensor data for human action recognition.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access these datasets.

The full citations I will extract are:

- For **MMAct**:
  > Kong, Q., Wu, Z., Deng, Z., Klinkigt, M., Tong, B., & Murakami, T. (2019). *MMAct: A large-scale dataset for cross-modal human action understanding*. In ICCV (pp. 8658–8667).

- For **EPIC-KITCHENS-100**:
  > Damen, D., Doughty, H., Farinella, G. M., Furnari, A., Kazakos, E., Ma, J., Moltisanti, D., Munro, J., Perrett, W., & Price, T. (2022). *Rescaling egocentric vision: Collection, pipeline and challenges for EPIC-KITCHENS-100*. IJCV, 1-23.

- For **Berkeley MHAD**:
  > Ofli, F., Chaudhry, R., Kurillo, G., Vidal, R., & Bajcsy, R. (2013). *Berkeley MHAD: A comprehensive multimodal human action database*. In WACV (pp. 53–60).

- For **UTD-MHAD**:
  > Liu, K., Chen, C., Jafari, R., & Kehtarnavaz, N. (2015). *UTD-MHAD: A multi-modal dataset for human action recognition utilizing a depth camera and a wearable inertial sensor*. In ICIP (pp. 168–172).

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This systematic approach ensures that I accurately capture all relevant datasets and their citations from the research paper.
