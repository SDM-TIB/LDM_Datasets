To extract datasets from the research paper titled "VM-UNet: Vision Mamba UNet for Medical Image Segmentation" by Jiacheng Ruan and Suncheng Xiang, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that experiments were conducted on the **ISIC17**, **ISIC18**, and **Synapse** datasets, which suggests that these datasets are crucial for the research.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section**, specifically **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used:

1. **ISIC17 Dataset**: This dataset is part of the International Skin Imaging Collaboration challenge from 2017, containing 2,150 dermoscopy images with segmentation mask labels. The authors mention a specific split of 1,500 training images and 650 test images.

2. **ISIC18 Dataset**: Similar to ISIC17, this dataset is from the 2018 challenge and includes 2,694 dermoscopy images with segmentation mask labels. The training set consists of 1,886 images, while the test set contains 808 images.

3. **Synapse Dataset**: This dataset is a multi-organ segmentation dataset comprising 30 abdominal CT cases with 3,779 axial abdominal clinical CT images, including 8 types of abdominal organs. The authors specify that 18 cases are used for training and 12 for testing.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **ISIC17 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Codella, N., Rotemberg, V., Tschandl, P., Celebi, M.E., Dusza, S., Gutman, D., Helba, B., Kalloo, A., Liopyris, K., Marchetti, M., et al. *Skin lesion analysis toward melanoma detection 2018: A challenge hosted by the international skin imaging collaboration (ISIC)*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1902.03368, 2019.

- For the **ISIC18 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Codella, N., Rotemberg, V., Tschandl, P., Celebi, M.E., Dusza, S., Gutman, D., Helba, B., Kalloo, A., Liopyris, K., Marchetti, M., et al. *ISIC 2017-skin lesion analysis towards melanoma detection*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1703.00523, 2017.

- For the **Synapse Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Landman, B., Xu, Z., Igelsias, J., Styner, M., Langerak, T., Klein, A. *MICCAI multi-atlas labeling beyond the cranial vault–workshop and challenge*. In: Proc. MICCAI Multi-Atlas Labeling Beyond Cranial Vault—Workshop Challenge, vol. 5, p. 12, 2015.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will prepare to compile this information into a structured format for further use or analysis.
