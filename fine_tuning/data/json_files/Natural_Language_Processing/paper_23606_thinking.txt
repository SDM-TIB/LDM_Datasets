To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The Missing Curve Detectors of InceptionV1: Applying Sparse Autoencoders to InceptionV1 Early Vision" by Liv Gorton, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, results, and conclusion sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on sparse autoencoders (SAEs) and their application to InceptionV1, but it does not mention specific datasets.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any references to datasets. The introduction discusses the challenges of polysemantic neurons and the application of SAEs but does not specify any datasets at this point.

Moving on to the **methods section**, I will look for any mention of datasets used for training or evaluation. In this section, the author mentions using the **ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC)** dataset for training the SAEs on image activations sampled from InceptionV1. This is a key dataset that I need to document.

In the **results section**, the author discusses findings related to the features learned by the SAEs but does not introduce any new datasets. However, the analysis methods mention collecting dataset examples from the ILSVRC dataset, reinforcing its importance in the study.

Finally, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the ILSVRC dataset. The reference provided is:

- **ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC)**:
  > Addison Howard, Eunbyung Park, W. K. *ImageNet Object Localization Challenge*. 2018. URL: https://kaggle.com/competitions/imagenet-object-localization-challenge.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will prepare to create an entry for the dataset, ensuring that I include the full citation as required.

In summary, the key dataset extracted from the paper is the ILSVRC dataset, and I will document it accordingly with its full citation.
