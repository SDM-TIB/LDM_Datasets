To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Document-level Entity-based Extraction as Template Generation" by Kung-Hsiang Huang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to find any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that experiments were conducted on the **MUC-4** and **SCIREX** datasets, indicating that these are the datasets used in the study.

Next, I will look into **section 4 (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used for their experiments. Here, I will find specific information about each dataset, including their characteristics and how they were utilized in the experiments.

1. **MUC-4 Dataset**: This dataset is described as containing 1,700 documents, with an average of about 400 tokens per document. It is used for the role-filler entity extraction task, and the documents are annotated with event templates.

2. **SCIREX Dataset**: The SCIREX dataset consists of scientific articles with entity, coreference, and relation annotations. It contains 306 documents for training, 66 for validation, and 66 for testing. This dataset is used for binary and 4-ary relation extraction tasks.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

- For the **MUC-4 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > 1992. Fourth Message Understanding Conference (MUC-4): Proceedings of a Conference Held in McLean, Virginia, June 16-18, 1992.

- For the **SCIREX Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Sarthak Jain, Madeleine van Zuylen, Hannaneh Hajishirzi, and Iz Beltagy. *SciREX: A challenge dataset for document-level information extraction*. In Proceedings of the 58th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, pages 7506â€“7516, Online, 2020.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that all relevant details are captured and properly attributed.
