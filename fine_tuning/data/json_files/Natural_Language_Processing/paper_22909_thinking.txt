To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Can formal argumentative reasoning enhance LLMs performances?" by Federico Castagna et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and evaluation sections** to look for any references to datasets. The abstract mentions a preliminary study and an experiment, which suggests that datasets may be involved, but I need to find specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section** where the authors describe the pipeline (MQArgEng) and its components. Here, I will look for any datasets used for training, testing, or evaluation purposes. The authors mention using **MT-Bench** as a benchmark for evaluation, which is a strong indicator that it may be a dataset or a collection of tasks used to assess the performance of the models.

In the **evaluation section**, the authors discuss the performance of their pipeline against MT-Bench, which is described as a multi-turn benchmark with 80 challenging queries across various categories. This indicates that MT-Bench is indeed a dataset used for evaluating the performance of LLMs.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for MT-Bench. The reference provided is:
> Zheng, L., Chiang, W.-L., Sheng, Y., Zhuang, S., Wu, Z., Zhuang, Y., Lin, Z., Li, D., Li, E. P., Xing, H., Zhang, H., Gonzalez, J. E., & Stoica, I. (2023). Judging LLM-as-a-Judge with MT-Bench and Chatbot Arena.

This citation provides the necessary details about the MT-Bench dataset.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and that full citations are included for reference. In this case, the only dataset identified is MT-Bench, which I will document accordingly.
