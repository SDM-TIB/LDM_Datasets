To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Continual Mixed-Language Pre-Training for Extremely Low-Resource Neural Machine Translation" by Zihan Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the challenges of data scarcity in low-resource languages, which suggests that datasets are crucial to the research. The introduction further emphasizes the use of multilingual pre-trained models and the need for datasets in low-resource settings.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology** and **experimental settings** sections, particularly section 3, which is explicitly labeled as "Datasets." Here, the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. They mention conducting experiments on 12 low-resource language pairs from OpenSubtitles, resulting in 24 directed translation pairs. This indicates that the datasets are derived from OpenSubtitles, which is a significant source for parallel corpora.

In section 3.1, the authors detail the specific language pairs involved in their experiments, including pairs like English-Indonesian (En-Id), English-Ukrainian (En-Uk), and others. They also mention the use of bilingual dictionaries from MUSE for generating mixed-language sentences, which is relevant for understanding the dataset's construction.

I will also check the **references** section to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The authors reference OpenSubtitles as the source of their parallel corpora, and I will need to provide the full citation for this dataset.

The citation for the OpenSubtitles dataset is:
> Pierre Lison and Jörg Tiedemann. *Opensubtitles2016: Extracting large parallel corpora from movie and TV subtitles*. In Proceedings of the Tenth International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC’16), pages 923–929, 2016.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the OpenSubtitles dataset as it is crucial for proper attribution.

In summary, the key steps I will take are:
1. Review the abstract and introduction for initial mentions of datasets.
2. Focus on the methodology and experimental settings sections for detailed descriptions of datasets.
3. Document the specific language pairs and their sources.
4. Retrieve and include full citations for the datasets from the references section.

After completing these steps, I will have a comprehensive understanding of the datasets used in the research paper, along with their proper citations.
