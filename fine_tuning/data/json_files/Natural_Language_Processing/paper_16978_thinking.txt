To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Human capital in the sustainable economic development of the energy sector" by Evgeny Kuzmin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions a dataset of **1933 documents** indexed in the Web of Science (WoS) database, which indicates that this is a significant dataset used for bibliometric analysis.

Next, I will focus on the **Materials and Methods section**, where the authors describe their methodology in detail. They specify that they utilized a dataset of **1933 documents** (research papers, conference proceedings, and book chapters) indexed in the WoS database from **1991 to 2023**. This is a clear identification of the dataset used in their analysis.

I will also check the **References section** to ensure that I can provide a full citation for the dataset. However, since the dataset is derived from the Web of Science, I will note that the citation for the dataset itself is not a traditional reference but rather a description of the source.

The relevant dataset extracted from the paper is:

1. **Dataset of 1933 documents**: This dataset consists of research papers, conference proceedings, and book chapters indexed in the Web of Science database, covering the period from 1991 to 2023.

Since the dataset is based on the Web of Science, I will provide a citation for the database itself, which is a widely recognized source for academic publications:

- **Web of Science**: Clarivate Analytics. *Web of Science: A Comprehensive Research Database*. Available at: https://www.webofscience.com/

Now, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly identifies the dataset and its citation, ensuring that I have accurately captured the necessary details for future reference or processing.
