To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Table-To-Text generation and pre-training with TABT5" by Ewa Andrejczuk et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract mentions that TABT5 achieves state-of-the-art results on several domains, which suggests that datasets are involved, but I need to find specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 6), as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, the authors explicitly list four datasets:

1. **WIKISQL**: This dataset is described as containing 80,654 instances for Table-QA tasks. The authors mention that it was created by crowd workers who paraphrased template-based questions.

2. **ENRON**: This dataset is used for formula prediction tasks and contains over 17,000 spreadsheets with 218,798 instances. It focuses on formulas with referenced cells in a rectangular neighborhood.

3. **TOTTO**: This dataset consists of 120,761 instances and is used for Table-to-Text generation. It pairs tables with natural language descriptions, created through a combination of heuristics and crowd worker annotations.

4. **FINQA**: This dataset contains 8,281 financial Table-QA pairs, along with their numerical reasoning processes.

After identifying these datasets, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

- **WIKISQL**:

- **FINQA**:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or processing. This ensures that I have accurately captured all necessary details for each dataset mentioned in the paper.
