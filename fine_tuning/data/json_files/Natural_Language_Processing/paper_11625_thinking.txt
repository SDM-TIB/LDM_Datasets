To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Overview of Robust and Multilingual Automatic Evaluation Metrics for Open-Domain Dialogue Systems at DSTC 11 Track 4" by Mario Rodríguez-Cantelar et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections detailing the datasets** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a general overview of the challenges in automatic evaluation metrics for dialogue systems, but I need to look for specific datasets in the subsequent sections.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the need for robust evaluation metrics and mention the importance of datasets for training and evaluation. However, I will need to look deeper into the sections that specifically outline the datasets used.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Task 1: Multilingual Automatic Metrics)** and **section 3 (Task 2: Robust Evaluation Metrics)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for each task. Here, they mention three clusters of datasets:

1. **CHANEL**: This dataset cluster consists of 18 well-known human-human dialogue datasets, totaling approximately 393,000 dialogues and 3 million turns. It was used as the training set.

2. **DSTC10**: This dataset includes over 35,000 turn-level human annotations collected during the DSTC10 Track 5, which were automatically translated into Spanish and Chinese, and then back-translated into English. This dataset was used for development and testing.

3. **CDIAL**: This dataset contains open-domain human-human dialogues originally in Chinese, with 3,470 dialogues and approximately 130,000 turns. It was used for development and testing as well.

Additionally, the authors describe test datasets, including:

- **HCEnglish**: A new human-chatbot English dataset with approximately 2,000 turns and 60 dialogues, manually annotated and translated into Chinese and Spanish.

- **HCChinese**: A human-chatbot Chinese dataset with approximately 5,000 turns and 500 dialogues, also manually annotated and translated into English.

- **DSTC10**: Used again for testing, with hidden data for Spanish.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets mentioned are as follows:

- For **CHANEL**, the citation is:

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations for further processing or review.
