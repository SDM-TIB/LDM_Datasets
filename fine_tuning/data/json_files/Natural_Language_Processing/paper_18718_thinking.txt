To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Convincing Rationales for Visual Question Answering Reasoning" by Kun Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. In the abstract, the authors mention that their method is trained and evaluated using samples converted from existing VQA datasets. This indicates that there are datasets involved, but I need to find their specific names.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Method)**, particularly **subsection 3.1 (VQA-R Dataset Synthesis)**, where the authors describe the process of synthesizing the VQA-R dataset. They mention that they review existing explanatory VQA datasets and specifically highlight **VQA-E** as the base version for their synthesis. This section provides crucial information about the datasets used.

The authors state that they synthesized the **VQA-R dataset**, which contains 33,726 image/question pairs annotated with answers, textual rationales, and visual rationales. This dataset is a key contribution of the paper and is essential for understanding their proposed method.

In addition, the authors mention that they evaluate their proposed method on three datasets: **VQA-R**, **VQA-X**, and **VQAv2**. I will need to gather full citations for these datasets from the **References section** of the paper.

Now, I will compile the full citations for each dataset:

1. **VQA-R Dataset**: This dataset is synthesized from VQA-E and is a novel contribution of this paper. The citation is:
   > Kun Li, George Vosselman, Michael Ying Yang. *Convincing Rationales for Visual Question Answering Reasoning*. University of Twente, 2024. (This citation is for the paper itself, as VQA-R is a new dataset introduced in this work.)

2. **VQA-E Dataset**: The citation for the VQA-E dataset is:
   > Qing Li, Qingyi Tao, Shafiq Joty, Jianfei Cai, and Jiebo Luo. *VQA-E: Explaining, Elaborating, and Enhancing Your Answers for Visual Questions*. In Proceedings of the European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), pages 552–567, 2018.

3. **VQA-X Dataset**: The citation for the VQA-X dataset is:
   > Dong Huk Park, Lisa Anne Hendricks, Zeynep Akata, Anna Rohrbach, Bernt Schiele, Trevor Darrell, and Marcus Rohrbach. *Multimodal Explanations: Justifying Decisions and Pointing to the Evidence*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 8779–8788, 2018.

4. **VQAv2 Dataset**: The citation for the VQAv2 dataset is:
   > Abhishek Das, Harsh Agrawal, Larry Zitnick, Devi Parikh, and Dhruv Batra. *VQA: Visual Question Answering*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision, pages 2425–2433, 2015.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets and their citations in a structured format for clarity and future reference. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their respective citations.
