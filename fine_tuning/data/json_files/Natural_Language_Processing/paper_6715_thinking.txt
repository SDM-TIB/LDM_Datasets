To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Controlling Extra-Textual Attributes about Dialogue Participants: A Case Study of English-to-Polish Neural Machine Translation" by Sebastian T. Vincent et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors contribute a "novel attribute-annotated dataset of Polish TV dialogue," which suggests that a dataset is indeed present.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Data Collection)**, where the authors describe the creation of the English-Polish parallel corpus of TV dialogue. They mention that they collected pre-training data from two corpora: **OpenSubtitles** and **Europarl**. This section will provide specific details about the datasets used.

1. **OpenSubtitles Dataset**: The authors reference the English-to-Polish part of OpenSubtitles, which is a large corpus of movie and TV subtitles. This dataset is crucial for their machine translation model.

2. **Europarl Dataset**: The authors also mention the Europarl corpus, which is a parallel corpus of European Parliament proceedings. This dataset is commonly used in machine translation research.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **OpenSubtitles Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Lison, Pierre, and Jörg Tiedemann. "OpenSubtitles2016: Extracting large parallel corpora from movie and TV subtitles." In Proceedings of the Tenth International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC’16), pages 923–929, Portorož, Slovenia, May. European Language Resources Association (ELRA), 2016.

- For the **Europarl Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Koehn, Philipp. "Europarl: A Parallel Corpus for Statistical Machine Translation." In Conference Proceedings: the tenth Machine Translation Summit, pages 79–86, Phuket, Thailand, 2005. AAMT.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all necessary details are included for each dataset.
