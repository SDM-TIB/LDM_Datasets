To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CCNet: Extracting High Quality Monolingual Datasets from Web Crawl Data" by Guillaume Wenzek et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract indicates that the authors have developed a pipeline to extract monolingual datasets from Common Crawl, which suggests that datasets are involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of creating high-quality datasets for low-resource languages and mention the use of Common Crawl as a source. This hints at the existence of datasets derived from this source, but I need to find specific details.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, where the authors describe their pipeline for processing Common Crawl data. They mention that their pipeline can be applied to any number of Common Crawl snapshots and that they processed the February 2019 snapshot, resulting in a dataset composed of 1.5 billion documents in 174 languages. This indicates that the dataset is derived from the Common Crawl project.

In the **results section**, the authors provide statistics about the resulting dataset, including the number of documents, tokens, and languages. They mention that the processed dataset contains 3.2TB of compressed documents across 174 languages, with specific statistics for the largest languages like English, Russian, and Chinese.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The key dataset derived from this paper is the one created from the Common Crawl snapshots. The citation for the Common Crawl dataset is:

- **Common Crawl Dataset**: 
  > Common Crawl. *Common Crawl: A Non-Profit Organization that Crawls the Web and Freely Provides its Archives and Data to the Public*. Available at: https://commoncrawl.org/

Additionally, the authors reference their own work and the methodology they followed, which is based on previous research. However, the primary dataset of interest is the one derived from Common Crawl.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and full citation, ensuring that all relevant details are captured for future reference or processing.
