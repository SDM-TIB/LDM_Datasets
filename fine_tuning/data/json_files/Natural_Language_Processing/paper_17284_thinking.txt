To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CAManim: Animating end-to-end network activation maps" by Emily Kaczmarek et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a general overview, but I will focus on sections that typically contain detailed information about datasets.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of explainable AI in various fields, including healthcare, but do not mention specific datasets. I will move on to the **materials and methods section**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments.

In the **results section**, the authors mention using models pre-trained on the **2012 ImageNet-1K dataset**. This dataset is crucial for understanding the context of their experiments, as it serves as a benchmark for evaluating the performance of their proposed method.

Additionally, they refer to a **Kaggle breast ultrasound dataset** used for fine-tuning a ResNet50 model to classify malignant versus normal images. The paper specifies that this dataset comprises 133 normal images and 210 malignant images, split into an 80-10-10% train-validation-test split.

Next, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **2012 ImageNet-1K dataset**, the citation is:
   > Deng J, Dong W, Socher R, Li LJ, Li K, Fei-Fei L. *Imagenet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In: 2009 IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition. IEEE; 2009. p. 248â€“255.

2. For the **Kaggle breast ultrasound dataset**, the citation is:
   > Al-Dhabyani W, Gomaa M, Khaled H, Fahmy A. *Dataset of breast ultrasound images*. Data in Brief. 2020;28:104863. doi:https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dib.2019.104863.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets referenced in the paper along with their proper citations.
