To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Self-Interpretable Graph-Level Anomaly Detection" by Yixin Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that "extensive experiments on 16 datasets demonstrate the anomaly detection capability and self-interpretability of SIGNET." This indicates that multiple datasets are involved, prompting me to look for specific names and details.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors provide a list of datasets used for the explainable GLAD task. They mention six datasets with ground-truth explanations, including three synthetic datasets and three real-world datasets. The datasets are:

1. **BM-MT**: A synthetic dataset where each normal graph has a house motif, and each anomaly has a 5-cycle motif.
2. **BM-MN**: A synthetic dataset where each normal graph has 1 or 2 house motifs, and each anomaly has 3 or 4 house motifs.
3. **BM-MS**: A synthetic dataset where each normal graph has a cycle motif with 3-5 nodes, and each anomaly has a cycle motif with 6-9 nodes.
4. **MNIST-0**: A dataset derived from the MNIST-75sp superpixel dataset, where digit 0 is considered normal, and other digits are anomalies.
5. **MNIST-1**: Similar to MNIST-0, but digit 1 is the normal class.
6. **MUTAG**: A molecular property prediction dataset where nonmutagenic molecules are normal samples, and mutagenic molecules are anomalies.

In addition, the authors mention that they verify the anomaly detection performance of SIGNET on 10 TU datasets, which are referenced in the paper.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. However, the paper does not provide specific citations for the synthetic datasets (BM-MT, BM-MN, BM-MS) as they are created by the authors. For the real-world datasets, I will look for the original sources:

- For **MNIST-0** and **MNIST-1**, the citation is:
  > Lukas Ruff, Robert Vandermeulen, Nico Goernitz, Lucas Deecke, Shoaib Ahmed Siddiqui, Alexander Binder, Emmanuel Müller, and Marius Kloft. *Deep One-Class Classification*. In International Conference on Machine Learning, pages 4393–4402, 2018.

- For **MUTAG**, the citation is:
  > Asim Kumar Debnath, Rosa L Lopez de Compadre, Gargi Debnath, Alan J Shusterman, and Corwin Hansch. *Structure-Activity Relationship of Mutagenic Aromatic and Heteroaromatic Nitro Compounds*. Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, 34(2):786–797, 1991.

Since the synthetic datasets do not have formal citations, I will note that they were created following specific methodologies referenced in the paper.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the necessary details and citations for each dataset, ready for structured output.
