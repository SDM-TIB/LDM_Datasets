To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MM-KWS: Multi-modal Prompts for Multilingual User-defined Keyword Spotting" by Zhiqi Ai et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors validated their method on the **LibriPhrase** and **WenetPhrase** datasets, which suggests these are key datasets for the research.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (specifically section 3) where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used. Here, they explicitly mention:

1. **LibriPhrase**: This dataset is constructed from the LibriSpeech corpus, with specific training and test splits. The authors describe how the dataset is divided into two parts: LibriPhrase Easy (LE) and LibriPhrase Hard (LH), and they mention the evaluation metrics used.

2. **WenetPhrase**: The authors introduce this dataset specifically for evaluating their method on Mandarin. They describe the dataset's construction process, including speech segmentation and text tokenization, and mention the number of samples and classes.

3. **Speech Commands dataset (SPC)**: This dataset is used to assess the zero-shot performance of their method. The authors provide a brief description of how they utilize this dataset for multi-classification tasks.

Now, I will look at the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

- For **LibriPhrase**, the citation is:
  > H.-K. Shin, H. Han, D. Kim, S.-W. Chung, and H.-G. Kang. *Learning audio-text agreement for open-vocabulary keyword spotting*. In Proceedings of Interspeech, 2022, pp. 1871–1875.

- For **WenetPhrase**, the citation is:
  > B. Zhang, H. Lv, P. Guo, Q. Shao, C. Yang, L. Xie, X. Xu, H. Bu, X. Chen, C. Zeng et al. *Wenetspeech: A 10000+ hours multi-domain mandarin corpus for speech recognition*. In Proceedings of ICASSP, 2022, pp. 6182–6186.

- For **Speech Commands dataset (SPC)**, the citation is:
  > P. Warden. *Speech commands: A dataset for limited-vocabulary speech recognition*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1804.03209, 2018.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
