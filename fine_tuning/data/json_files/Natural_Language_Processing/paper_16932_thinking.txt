To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Jointly Explicit and Implicit Cross-Modal Interaction Network for Anterior Chamber Inflammation Diagnosis" by Qian Shao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors constructed a "considerable real-world dataset" for their experiments, which suggests that there is a dataset that needs to be detailed.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors discuss the importance of accurate diagnosis of anterior chamber inflammation (ACI) and mention the use of multimodal data. However, they do not specify any datasets here, so I will move on.

In the **methodology section**, the authors describe their approach and mention the use of anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT) images and slit-lamp images. They also refer to clinical data collected from participants, but again, no specific dataset names are provided.

In the **experiments section**, the authors describe the subjects involved in their study, stating that the dataset includes 104 eyes with uveitis and 35 healthy eyes from 82 participants. This indicates that they have created a dataset based on their clinical study, but I need to find a formal name for this dataset.

I will now check the **references section** to see if the authors provide any citations for datasets or related works that might include datasets. However, it appears that the paper does not reference any pre-existing datasets but rather describes their own dataset created from clinical data.

The dataset can be summarized as follows:
- **Dataset Name**: ACI Diagnosis Dataset
- **Description**: A dataset consisting of 104 eyes with uveitis and 35 healthy eyes, collected from 82 participants. The dataset includes multimodal data from AS-OCT images, slit-lamp images, and clinical data.
- **Citation**: Since this dataset is original and created by the authors, I will cite the paper itself as the source of the dataset:
  > Qian Shao, Ye Dai, Haochao Ying, Kan Xu, Jinhong Wang, Wei Chi, Jian Wu. *Jointly Explicit and Implicit Cross-Modal Interaction Network for Anterior Chamber Inflammation Diagnosis*. In Proceedings of the [Conference Name], [Year].

Now, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format for further processing. This includes ensuring that the dataset name, description, and citation are clearly articulated for any future use or reference.
