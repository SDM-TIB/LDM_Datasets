To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A systematic review on expert systems for improving energy efficiency in the manufacturing industry" by Borys Ioshchikhes et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that may be mentioned. The abstract discusses a systematic review of expert systems (ESs) aimed at improving energy efficiency, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine **section 3 (Literature review)**, particularly focusing on the **literature analysis and synthesis** part. This section outlines the publications analyzed in the systematic review, and it is likely that datasets or data sources are referenced here. I will look for any tables or figures that summarize the publications, as they may include dataset names or descriptions.

In **Table 1**, the authors provide an overview of the analyzed publications, including their identifiers and applications. I will check if any of these publications mention specific datasets used in their studies. If a publication is relevant, I will note its identifier and the corresponding citation.

I will also look for any **specific mentions of datasets** in the context of the expert systems discussed in the paper. If the authors refer to datasets used in the development or evaluation of these systems, I will extract that information.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for the datasets used in the studies reviewed.

For example, if I find that a particular expert system utilized the **Penn Action Dataset**, I will ensure to include the full citation for that dataset as follows:

- **Penn Action Dataset**: 
  > Wenzheng Zhang, Menglong Zhu, and Konstantinos G. Derpanis. *From Actemes to Action: A Strongly-Supervised Representation for Detailed Action Understanding*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 2248â€“2255, 2013.

I will repeat this process for any other datasets identified in the paper, ensuring that I capture the necessary details and citations accurately.

Finally, I will compile all the extracted datasets and their citations into a structured format for easy reference and further analysis.
