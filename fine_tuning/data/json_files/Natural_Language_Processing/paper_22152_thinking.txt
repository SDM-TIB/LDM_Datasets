To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Low-resource speech recognition and dialect identification of Irish in a multi-task framework" by Liam Lonergan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and data sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of Hybrid CTC/Attention encoder-decoder models for Irish low-resource speech recognition and dialect identification, which suggests that datasets are involved. 

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Data)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used in their experiments. Here, I will identify the specific datasets mentioned:

1. **MíleGlór Corpus**: This dataset consists of 45.7 hours of recordings from 369 speakers, including both crowd-sourced and live recordings. It is specifically designed for speech recognition development in Irish.

2. **Synthesis Corpus**: This corpus contains 25.6 hours of recordings from 5 L1 speakers, used to create synthetic voices for the ABAIR project.

3. **Corpas na Cainte Beo**: A spontaneous speech corpus of broadcast material tagged with dialect information, provided by Foras na Gaeilge’s New English-Irish Dictionary project.

4. **Audiobooks**: The authors used recordings made by two Mu Irish speakers reading specific books, along with other collections of stories.

In addition, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. However, the paper does not provide formal citations for the datasets themselves, as they are primarily project-specific collections. Instead, I will note the relevant details provided in the text.

Now, I will compile the information about each dataset, ensuring to include the context and details provided in the paper:

- For **MíleGlór Corpus**, I will note that it is a dataset created for speech recognition development with specific metadata about the speakers.

- For **Synthesis Corpus**, I will mention that it consists of recordings used for creating synthetic voices.

- For **Corpas na Cainte Beo**, I will highlight its role as a spontaneous speech corpus with dialect tagging.

- For the **Audiobooks**, I will summarize the sources and the nature of the recordings used.

Finally, I will ensure that I have a clear and concise description of each dataset, including their purposes and any relevant details, ready for structured output. This will help in organizing the information for further processing or review.
