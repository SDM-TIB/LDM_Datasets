To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Quantifying the Internal Validity of Weighted Estimands" by Alexandre Poirier and Tymon S loczyÂ´nski, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections that discuss empirical applications or experiments**. These sections typically provide insights into the datasets used for analysis. The abstract mentions the development of tools to quantify internal validity, which may imply the use of specific datasets for empirical validation.

Next, I will focus on the **Applications section** (Section 2) and the **Empirical Application section** (Section 6). These sections are likely to contain explicit references to datasets used in the analysis. For instance, in Section 6, the authors discuss the effects of unilateral divorce laws on female suicide rates, which suggests that there is a dataset related to state-level suicide rates and divorce laws.

I will also check the **References section** for any citations of datasets or studies that may have provided the data used in the analysis. This is crucial for obtaining full citations for each dataset.

Now, I will summarize the datasets identified:

1. **Dataset on Female Suicide Rates**: This dataset includes state-level female suicide rates from the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) for the years 1964-1996, used to analyze the impact of unilateral divorce laws.
   - Citation: Stevenson, B., & Wolfers, J. (2006). "Bargaining in the Shadow of the Law: Divorce Laws and Family Distress." *Quarterly Journal of Economics*, 121(1), 267-288.

2. **Dataset on Unilateral Divorce Laws**: This dataset includes information on the implementation of unilateral divorce laws across various states during the specified period.
   - Citation: Goodman-Bacon, A. (2021). "Difference-in-Differences with Variation in Treatment Timing." *Journal of Econometrics*, 225(2), 254-277.

After identifying these datasets, I will ensure that I have the full citations ready for each dataset, as they are essential for proper documentation and referencing in any subsequent analysis or reporting.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for easy access and review, ensuring that all necessary details are included for each dataset.
