To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Pack and Measure: An Effective Approach for Influence Propagation in Social Networks" by Faisal N. Abu-Khzam, Ghinwa Bou Matar, and Sergio Thoumi, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, but I need to look for specific datasets used in the experiments.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the influence maximization problem and mention various heuristics and algorithms, but they do not specify any datasets yet. I will continue to the **experimental results section** where datasets are likely to be detailed.

In **section 4 (Experimental Results)**, the authors mention conducting experiments on two specific datasets: 

1. **ca-GrQc**: This dataset is a collaboration network with 5,242 vertices and 14,496 edges.
2. **ca-AstroPh**: This dataset is another collaboration network with 18,772 vertices and 198,110 edges.

The authors provide a table summarizing the properties of these networks, confirming their use in the experiments.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The authors reference the SNAP dataset collection, which is where these datasets originate. The citation for the SNAP dataset is:

- For **ca-GrQc** and **ca-AstroPh**, the citation is:
  > J. Leskovec and A. Krevl. *SNAP Datasets: Stanford large network dataset collection*. http://snap.stanford.edu/data, June 2014.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. Each dataset will be described with its name, properties, and full citation to ensure proper attribution.
