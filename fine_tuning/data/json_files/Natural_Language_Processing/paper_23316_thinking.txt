To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Mutual Information Analysis of Neuromorphic Coding for Distributed Wireless Spiking Neural Networks" by Pietro Savazzi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of neuromorphic coding techniques, but it does not specify any datasets. The introduction also focuses on the theoretical aspects of wireless spiking neural networks without naming specific datasets.

Next, I will examine **section II (Neural Coding Schemes)** and **section III (Mutual Information Analysis)**, where the authors describe various coding schemes and their performance metrics. However, these sections primarily discuss methodologies and do not reference any datasets.

I will then check the **results section** for any mention of datasets used for experiments or evaluations. The results focus on comparing the performance of different coding techniques but do not provide specific datasets.

Finally, I will review the **References section** to see if any datasets are cited indirectly through the works referenced. The references include various studies related to spiking neural networks and coding techniques, but they do not explicitly mention datasets used in the current study.

After thoroughly reviewing the paper, it appears that there are no specific datasets mentioned or utilized in this research. The authors focus on theoretical analysis and comparisons of coding techniques rather than empirical evaluations based on specific datasets.

Since no datasets are identified in the paper, I will not be able to provide full citations for any datasets. Instead, I will summarize my findings, noting that the paper does not include specific datasets for analysis or experimentation.
