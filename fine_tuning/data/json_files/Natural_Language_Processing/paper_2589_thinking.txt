To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Predicting Infectiousness for Proactive Contact Tracing" by Yoshua Bengio et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract discusses the use of a COVID-19 epidemiological simulator and mentions the development of methods for predicting infectiousness. This suggests that there may be datasets related to COVID-19 simulations or contact tracing.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **methodology** and **experiments** sections. In the methodology, the authors refer to a COVID-19 agent-based simulation testbed called **COVIsim** (Gupta et al., 2020), which is used to generate datasets for training their predictive models. This indicates that COVIsim is a key dataset for their research.

In the **experiments** section, I will check if the authors provide details about the datasets used for training and validation. They mention generating large datasets of approximately 10 million samples from 240 runs of the simulator, which includes various parameters related to contact tracing and infectiousness. However, they do not provide a specific name for this dataset beyond referring to it as generated data from COVIsim.

Now, I will compile the full citation for the **COVIsim** dataset as it is the primary dataset referenced in the paper. The citation is as follows:
> Prateek Gupta, Tegan Maharaj, Martin Weiss, Nasim Rahaman, Hannah Alsdurf, Abhinav Sharma, et al. *COVIsim: an agent-based model for evaluating methods of digital contact tracing*. 2020.

Finally, I will summarize the findings regarding the datasets in a clear format, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset identified. The main dataset extracted from this paper is the COVIsim dataset, which is crucial for the experiments conducted by the authors. 

After completing this process, I will be ready to present the dataset information in the required format for further analysis or processing.
