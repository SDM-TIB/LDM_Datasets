To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Error Dynamics in Affine Group Systems" by Xinghan Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's focus, but it may not explicitly mention datasets. Therefore, I will pay close attention to the introduction, where the authors often discuss previous work and may reference datasets used in their studies.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets or experiments**. In many research papers, authors will describe the datasets they used for their experiments in a specific section, often labeled as "Datasets" or "Experiments." This section typically includes details about the datasets, such as their names, sizes, and characteristics.

If the paper includes any **figures or tables**, I will examine them closely, as they may summarize dataset information or provide additional context that is not detailed in the text.

Once I identify the datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. This is crucial, as I need to provide complete and accurate citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. I will ensure that I capture all necessary details, including authors, titles, publication venues, and years.

For example, if the authors mention a dataset like "SE2(3) for inertial measurement units," I will look for its original source or any relevant papers that describe it. If the dataset is well-known, I will provide the citation for the foundational paper that introduced it.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation.

Finally, I will organize the extracted information in a clear and structured manner, ready for further processing or review.
