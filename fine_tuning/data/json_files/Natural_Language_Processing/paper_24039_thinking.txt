To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multimodal Learning With Intraoperative CBCT & Variably Aligned Preoperative CT Data To Improve Segmentation" by Maximilian E. Tschuchnig et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors use a synthetically generated dataset containing real CT and synthetic CBCT volumes, which suggests that there is at least one dataset to extract.

Next, I will examine the **methodology section**, particularly the **Dataset Generation** subsection, where the authors describe how they generated the datasets. They mention using the **LiTS dataset** for their experiments, which is crucial information.

In the **Dataset Generation** section, the authors detail the process of synthesizing CBCT data from the LiTS dataset. They specify that the LiTS dataset consists of 131 abdominal CT scans in the training set and 70 test volumes, which provides important context about the dataset's content.

I will also look for any references to other datasets in the **results** and **discussion sections** to ensure I capture all datasets used in the study. However, the primary dataset mentioned is the LiTS dataset, which is used for liver and liver tumor segmentation.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to retrieve the full citation for the LiTS dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:

- For the **LiTS dataset**:
  > Bilic, P., Christ, P., Li, H., Vorontsov, E., Ben-Cohen, A., Kaissis, G., others, Menze, B. (2023). *The liver tumor segmentation benchmark (lits)*. Medical Image Analysis, 84. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.media.2022.102680

Since the authors also mention generating synthetic datasets based on the LiTS dataset, I will note that these synthetic datasets are derived from the original LiTS dataset but do not require separate citations as they are not standalone datasets.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the LiTS dataset as it is the primary dataset referenced in the study. This will ensure that all necessary details are captured for future reference or analysis.
