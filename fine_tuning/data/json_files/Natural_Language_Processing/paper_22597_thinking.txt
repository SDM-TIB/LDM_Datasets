To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Revealed preference and revealed preference cycles: a survey" by Paweł Dziewulski, Joshua Lanier, and John K.-H. Quah, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections that discuss methodology and results** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's focus on Afriat's Theorem and its implications, but it does not explicitly mention datasets.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any references to specific datasets. The introduction discusses revealed preferences and utility maximization but does not provide specific dataset names.

I will then look for sections that explicitly mention datasets, such as **Section 2 (Rationalizable behavior in a market setting)** and **Section 4 (Related results and extensions)**. These sections may contain references to datasets used in the context of revealed preference analysis.

In **Section 2.1 (Afriat’s Theorem)**, the authors discuss the conditions under which datasets can be rationalized by utility functions. However, they do not provide specific datasets. I will continue to search through the paper for any examples or case studies that might include datasets.

I will also check the **References section** for any cited datasets or studies that may have used datasets relevant to the paper's analysis. This section may provide full citations for datasets that are referenced throughout the paper.

If I find any datasets mentioned, I will ensure to extract the full citation for each dataset. For example, if a dataset is mentioned in the context of Afriat's Theorem, I will look for the original source of that dataset and include it in my extraction.

Finally, I will compile the identified datasets along with their full citations into a structured format for easy reference. If no specific datasets are mentioned, I will note that as well.

By following this methodical approach, I will ensure that I accurately extract and cite any datasets referenced in the paper.
