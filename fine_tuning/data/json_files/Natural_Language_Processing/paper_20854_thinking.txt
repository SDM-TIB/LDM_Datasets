To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SCANet: Correcting LEGO Assembly Errors with Self-Correct Assembly Network" by Hao Dong et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the **LEGO Error Correction Assembly Dataset (LEGO-ECA)**, which is explicitly stated to support research in assembly error correction. This indicates that a dataset is indeed present.

Next, I will examine **section III (LEGO Error Correction Assembly Dataset)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the LEGO-ECA dataset. They describe it as comprising **1,429 LEGO assembly manuals**, each containing 2D illustrations of assembly steps and various assembly failure scenarios. This section will provide the necessary details for documenting the dataset.

In addition, I will look for any other datasets mentioned in the paper. The authors reference the **Synthetic LEGO Dataset** as the basis for constructing the LEGO-ECA dataset. This is important as it provides context and a foundational dataset for the LEGO-ECA.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset from the **References section** of the paper:

1. For the **LEGO Error Correction Assembly Dataset (LEGO-ECA)**, since it is a new dataset introduced in this paper, I will cite it as follows:
   > Dong, H., Wan, Y., Zhou, K., Chen, J. (2023). SCANet: Correcting LEGO Assembly Errors with Self-Correct Assembly Network. In Proceedings of the [Conference Name], [pages], [year]. [URL if available]

2. For the **Synthetic LEGO Dataset**, the citation is:
   > Wang, R., Zhang, Y., Mao, J., Cheng, C., Wu, J. (2022). Translating a visual LEGO manual to a machine-executable plan. In Proceedings of the European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), [pages], 2022.

After identifying the datasets and their citations, I will compile the information into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations. This will ensure that all relevant details are captured for future reference or analysis.
