To extract datasets from the research paper titled "GRAM: Global Reasoning for Multi-Page VQA" by Tsachi Blau et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors showcase their method's performance on benchmarks for multi-page DocVQA, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors state that two recently introduced datasets, **MP-DocVQA** and **DUDE**, have opened new avenues for research in multi-page DocVQA. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for their experiments.

In the **experiments section**, specifically section 4.1, the authors provide details about the datasets used. They describe:

1. **MP-DocVQA Dataset**: This dataset features 46,000 questions spanning over 48,000 images, including various layout elements and text types. It is primarily used for extractive question answering.

2. **DUDE Dataset**: This dataset is smaller, with 23,700 questions over 3,000 documents, and includes complex questions that require reasoning beyond the text content.

Both datasets are confirmed to be used in the experiments, as the authors report results based on them.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **MP-DocVQA**, the citation is:
  > Rubén Tito, Dimosthenis Karatzas, and Ernest Valveny. *Hierarchical multimodal transformers for multi-page docvqa*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2212.05935, 2022.

- For **DUDE**, the citation is:
  > Jordy Landeghem, Rubén Tito, Łukasz Borchmann, Michał Pietruszka, Paweł Józiak, Rafał Powalski, Dawid Jurkiewicz, Mickaël Coustaty, Bertrand Ackaert, Ernest Valveny, et al. *Document understanding dataset and evaluation (DUDE)*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2305.08455, 2023.

With these citations in hand, I will now compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
