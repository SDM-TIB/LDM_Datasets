To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Sensor Attacks and Resilient Defense on HVAC Systems for Energy Market Signal Tracking" by Guanyu Tian, Qun Zhou Sun, and Yiyuan Qiao, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or data sources.

Next, I will examine the **experiments and results sections** to see if the authors describe any datasets used for testing their models or validating their findings. This is often where datasets are detailed, including their characteristics and how they were utilized in the study.

In this paper, the authors discuss the use of a **digital twin model of a test building with a single-chiller HVAC system** for their simulations. I will look for any specific datasets related to this model, such as environmental input profiles or parameters used in the simulations.

I will also check the **appendices and references** for any additional datasets or sources that may not have been detailed in the main text. The references may provide citations for datasets or models that were used in the research.

After identifying the datasets, I will ensure to gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This is crucial for proper attribution and for others to locate the datasets.

For example, if the paper references a dataset related to HVAC systems or energy market signals, I will note the dataset name and its citation. If the authors refer to any existing datasets, I will extract the relevant citation information from the references section.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including their names and full citations, into a structured format for clarity and ease of use.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and cite the datasets used in the research paper.
