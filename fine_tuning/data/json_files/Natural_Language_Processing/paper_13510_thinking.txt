To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Denoising Attention for Query-aware User Modeling in Personalized Search" by Elias Bassani et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and it may mention datasets used for evaluation or experimentation.

Next, I will focus on the **section 6 (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, the authors mention two datasets:

1. **Web Search Dataset**: This dataset is derived from the AOL query log and is used to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed Denoising Attention mechanism in a web search context. The authors provide statistics about the dataset, including the number of documents, queries, users, and average query lengths.

2. **Academic Search Dataset**: This dataset is constructed using the ArnetMiner’s Citation Network Dataset and is used to evaluate the model in a domain-specific search scenario. The authors describe how the dataset was generated, including the process of creating user-query-document triplets.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For the **Web Search Dataset**, the citation is:

In Advances in Information Retrieval - 44th European Conference on IR Research, ECIR 2022, Stavanger, Norway, April 10-14, 2022, Proceedings, Part I (Lecture Notes in Computer Science, Vol. 13185), Springer, 627–640. https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-99736-6_42

For the **Academic Search Dataset**, the citation is:
> Tabrizi, S. A., Shakery, A., Zamani, H., & Tavallaei, M. A. (2018). PERSON: Personalized information retrieval evaluation based on citation networks. Inf. Process. Manag., 54(4), 630–656. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ipm.2018.04.004

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that highlights each dataset's name, description, and citation. This will ensure that the datasets are properly documented and can be referenced in future work.
