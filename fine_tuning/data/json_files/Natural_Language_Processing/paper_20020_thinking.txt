To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Rethinking Urban Flood Risk Assessment By Adapting Health Domain Perspective" by Zhewei Liu, Kai Yin, and Ali Mostafavi, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a general overview, but the introduction often contains specific references to datasets or studies that have utilized datasets.

Next, I will examine **section 1 (Introduction)** for any mentions of datasets used in previous studies or analyses related to flood risk assessment. The authors may refer to existing datasets that inform their perspective or methodology.

I will then look for a **dedicated section on datasets or methodology** where the authors might describe the datasets they used for their analysis or case studies. If such a section exists, it will likely provide detailed information about the datasets, including their names, sizes, and the context in which they were used.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, if the authors reference datasets like the **National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP)** or **FEMA flood maps**, I will ensure to find the appropriate citations for these datasets. 

If the paper discusses datasets from other studies, I will also look for the original papers that introduced those datasets to provide accurate citations.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation in the correct format.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset information for presentation or further processing, ensuring that all citations are complete and accurate.
