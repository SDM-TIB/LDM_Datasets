To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Large Language Model Watermark Stealing With Mixed Integer Programming" by Zhaoxi Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of the proposed attack on various LLMs, which suggests that datasets may be involved, but I need to find specific names.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments** section. In this paper, the authors mention using the **C4 dataset** for generating watermarked text. This is a clear indication of a dataset being utilized.

I will then check the **references section** to find the full citation for the C4 dataset. The citation for the C4 dataset is:
> Colin Raffel, Noam Shazeer, Adam Roberts, Katherine Lee, Sharan Narang, Michael Matena, Yanqi Zhou, Wei Li, and Peter J. Liu. *Exploring the Limits of Transfer Learning with a Unified Text-to-Text Transformer*. arXiv e-prints (2019). arXiv:1910.10683.

Additionally, I will look for any other datasets mentioned throughout the paper, especially in the **experiments** section. The authors may refer to datasets used for training or evaluation purposes, such as datasets for benchmarking the performance of their watermarking techniques.

After identifying the datasets, I will ensure to document each dataset's name, description, and full citation accurately. 

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format for easy reference, ensuring that each dataset is clearly labeled with its citation for future use.
