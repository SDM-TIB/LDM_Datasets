To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Simple and Effective Method to Improve Zero-Shot Cross-Lingual Transfer Learning" by Kunbo Ding et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of the proposed method on specific tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 3) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention using **XNLI** and **PAWS-X** for evaluation. I will note down these datasets and look for any specific details provided about them.

In the **subsection 3.1 (Dataset and setup)**, the authors explicitly state that they use **XNLI** for cross-lingual natural language inference and **PAWS-X** for paraphrase identification. They also mention that the augmentation datasets are obtained from Huang et al. (2021), which indicates that there are additional datasets involved in the augmentation process.

Now, I will check the **References section** to gather full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. For **XNLI**, the citation is:
   > Alexis Conneau, Ruty Rinott, Guillaume Lample, Adina Williams, Samuel Bowman, Holger Schwenk, and Veselin Stoyanov. *XNLI: Evaluating cross-lingual sentence representations*. In Proceedings of the 2018 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 2475–2485, 2018.

2. For **PAWS-X**, the citation is:
   > Yinfei Yang, Yuan Zhang, Chris Tar, and Jason Baldridge. *PAWS-X: A cross-lingual adversarial dataset for paraphrase identification*. In Proceedings of the 2019 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 3687–3692, 2019.

Additionally, I will note that the augmentation datasets are derived from Huang et al. (2021), which I will also cite:
   > Kuan-Hao Huang, Wasi Ahmad, Nanyun Peng, and Kai-Wei Chang. *Improving zero-shot cross-lingual transfer learning via robust training*. In Proceedings of the 2021 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 1684–1697, 2021.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
