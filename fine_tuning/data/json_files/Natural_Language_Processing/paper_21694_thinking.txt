To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Transformer tricks: Removing weights for skipless transformers" by Nils Graef, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly referenced. The abstract discusses transformer architectures and weight reduction techniques but does not mention specific datasets. Therefore, I will proceed to the introduction and experiments sections.

In the **introduction**, the focus is primarily on the theoretical aspects of transformer architectures and their modifications. There are no datasets mentioned here either.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section**. This section typically contains information about datasets used for evaluation. However, upon reviewing the text, it appears that the paper does not provide any specific datasets used in experiments. Instead, it discusses theoretical configurations and weight counts for models like Pythia-6.9B and Mistral-7B without referencing any datasets.

Since I have not found any datasets mentioned in the paper, I will also check the **references section** to see if any datasets are cited indirectly through the works referenced. However, the references primarily consist of papers discussing transformer architectures and techniques, rather than datasets themselves.

Given that no datasets are explicitly mentioned or referenced in the paper, I will conclude that there are no datasets to extract from this research paper.

In summary, I will document that the paper does not contain any datasets, and therefore, there are no citations to provide. This will be noted in my final output.
