To extract datasets from the research paper titled "xSemAD: Explainable Semantic Anomaly Detection in Event Logs Using Sequence-to-Sequence Models" by Kiran Busch et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental evaluation sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on a large dataset from industry, which indicates that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experimental Evaluation)**, specifically **subsection 4.1 (Dataset)**, where the authors describe the dataset used for training and evaluation. Here, they mention the creation of a new dataset from the SAP Signavio Academic Models (SAP-SAM) collection, which is the largest publicly accessible collection of business process models. They provide details about the filtering and cleaning operations applied to the raw dataset, resulting in a set of 38,312 process models.

The authors also mention that they generated event logs from these process models using the PM4Py library, which indicates that the dataset is derived from real-world process models.

Now, I will look for the full citation of the dataset mentioned in the references section. The relevant citation for the SAP Signavio Academic Models (SAP-SAM) collection is:

> Sola, D., Warmuth, C., Schäfer, B., Badakhshan, P., Rehse, J.R., Kampik, T. *SAP Signavio Academic Models: A Large Process Model Dataset*. In: International Conference on Process Mining. pp. 453–465. Springer, 2022.

Additionally, the authors refer to the international declarations log used in their real-world application, which is part of the BPI 2020 challenge. I will also retrieve the citation for this dataset:

> van Dongen, B. *BPI 2020: International declarations challenge*. https://doi.org/10.4121/uuid:2bbf8f6a-fc50-48eb-aa9e-c4ea5ef7e8c5, 2020.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets identified in the paper, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research.
