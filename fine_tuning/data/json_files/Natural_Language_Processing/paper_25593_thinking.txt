To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SLVideo: A Sign Language Video Moment Retrieval Framework" by Gonçalo Vinagre Martins et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the system uses a collection of **five hours of annotated Sign Language videos** for testing. This indicates that there is a dataset involved, but I need to find more specific details about it.

Next, I will examine the **Video and Annotations Formats section** (Section 2) where the authors describe the dataset in more detail. They mention that the dataset consists of **Portuguese Sign Language videos** and that it includes annotations in the EAF format. This section confirms the existence of a specific dataset but does not provide a formal name or citation yet.

I will also look into the **Experiments and Results section** (Section 5) to see if there are any additional details or references to the dataset used. However, it appears that the dataset is consistently referred to as a collection of annotated Portuguese Sign Language videos without a specific name.

Since the paper does not provide a formal citation for the dataset, I will need to reference the dataset as described in the paper itself. The authors do not cite an external source for the dataset, which means I will create a citation based on the information provided in the paper.

Now, I will compile the information I have gathered:

1. **Dataset Name**: Annotated Portuguese Sign Language Videos
   - **Description**: A collection of over five hours of video footage featuring people performing signs in Portuguese Sign Language, annotated with EAF format annotations.
   - **Citation**: Gonçalo Vinagre Martins, Afonso Quinaz, Carla Viegas, Sofia Cavaco, João Magalhães. 2018. SLVideo: A Sign Language Video Moment Retrieval Framework. In Proceedings of Make sure to enter the correct conference title from your rights confirmation email (Conference acronym ’XX). ACM, New York, NY, USA, 5 pages. https://doi.org/XXXXXXX.XXXXXXX

Since the dataset is not formally named or cited from an external source, I will use the paper itself as the citation for the dataset.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry in the required format, ensuring that all relevant details are included for clarity and proper referencing.
