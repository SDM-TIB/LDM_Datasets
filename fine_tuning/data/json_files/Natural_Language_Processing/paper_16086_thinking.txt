To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The Curious Decline of Linguistic Diversity: Training Language Models on Synthetic Text" by Yanzhu Guo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I identify and accurately cite each dataset mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to gather initial insights about the datasets used in the research. The abstract mentions the use of novel metrics and recursive finetuning experiments, which suggests that specific datasets are likely involved in these experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4) where the authors describe their experimental setup. Here, they detail the tasks they conducted, which include news summarization, scientific abstract generation, and story generation. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets associated with these tasks.

In **Section 4.1 (Experimental Setup)**, the authors specifically mention three datasets:

1. **XL-SUM**: This dataset is used for the news summarization task. It consists of 306,522 samples in the training set and 11,535 samples in the test set. The average length of the news articles is 386 tokens, while the average length of the summaries is 28 tokens.

2. **ACL Anthology**: This dataset is utilized for scientific abstract generation. The authors parsed a BibTeX file containing abstracts from the ACL Anthology, resulting in 40,512 samples for training and 2,132 samples for testing.

3. **WritingPrompts**: This dataset is employed for the story generation task. It contains 272,600 samples in the training set and 15,138 samples in the test set.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **XL-SUM**, the citation is:
  > Hasan, T., Bhattacharjee, A., Islam, M. S., Mubasshir, K., Li, Y.-F., Kang, Y.-B., & Shahriyar, R. (2021). XL-SUM: Large-scale multilingual abstractive summarization for 44 languages. In *Findings of the Association for Computational Linguistics: ACL-IJCNLP 2021*, pages 4693–4703.

- For **ACL Anthology**, the citation is:
  > ACL Anthology. (2023). *ACL Anthology*. Retrieved from https://aclanthology.org.

- For **WritingPrompts**, the citation is:
  > Fan, A., Lewis, M., & Dauphin, Y. (2018). Hierarchical neural story generation. In *Proceedings of the 56th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers)*, pages 889–898.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
