To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Improved Algorithms for Contextual Dynamic Pricing" by Matilde Tullii et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, but it may not contain specific dataset names. The introduction often outlines the context and significance of the research, which might include references to datasets used in prior studies.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments or results sections**. These sections typically provide detailed information about the datasets used for validation or testing of the proposed algorithms. If the paper includes tables or figures, I will examine them closely, as they may summarize dataset characteristics or provide references.

If the paper mentions any datasets, I will take note of their names, descriptions, and any relevant details such as the number of samples, features, or specific contexts in which they were used. 

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. I will ensure that I capture the authors, title, publication venue, and year for each dataset.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset called "XYZ Dataset" used for contextual dynamic pricing, I would look for its citation in the references. If the citation is not directly provided, I may need to search for it in related literature or online repositories.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset entry includes:
- The name of the dataset
- A brief description of the dataset
- The full citation for the dataset

This structured approach will help ensure that I accurately capture all relevant datasets and their citations from the paper.
