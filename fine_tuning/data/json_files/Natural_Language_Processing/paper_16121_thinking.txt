To extract datasets from the research paper titled "FIKIT: Priority-Based Real-time GPU Multi-tasking Scheduling with Kernel Identification" by Wenqing Wu, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research but may not detail specific datasets. The introduction often discusses the context and may reference datasets used in prior work, which could be relevant.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments and evaluation sections**. These sections typically contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used for testing the proposed methods. I will look for any specific names of datasets, their characteristics, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

In this paper, the author mentions using the **Google Street View dataset** for various machine learning models. I will note the specific applications of this dataset in the experiments, such as for image segmentation, classification, and object detection tasks.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Google Street View dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the source of the dataset.

The citation for the Google Street View dataset is:
> A.R. Zamir and M. Shah. *Image Geo-localization Based on Multiple Nearest Neighbor Feature Matching using Generalized Graphs*. IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 2014. https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2014.2299799

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset details, including the name, description, and citation, ensuring that I adhere to the required format for documentation.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for review, ensuring that each dataset is clearly defined and properly cited, ready for any further processing or integration into a larger dataset repository.
