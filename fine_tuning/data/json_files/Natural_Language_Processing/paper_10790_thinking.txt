To extract datasets from the research paper titled "AMPERE: AMR-Aware Prefix for Generation-Based Event Argument Extraction Model" by I-Hung Hsu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. In the abstract, the authors mention conducting experiments on the **ACE2005** and **ERE** datasets, which indicates that these datasets are crucial for their research.

Next, I will look for specific sections that discuss datasets in detail. The **experiments section** is likely to provide more context about how these datasets were used, including any specific configurations or splits. In this case, the authors explicitly mention using the ACE2005 dataset and the ERE dataset for their experiments.

I will then check the **methodology** section, where the authors describe their experimental setup. They mention using the ACE2005 dataset (Doddington et al., 2004) and the ERE dataset (Song et al., 2015). This confirms that these are the datasets utilized in their research.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the **references section** of the paper:

1. **ACE2005 Dataset**:
   - Citation: 
     > George Doddington, Alexis Mitchell, Mark Przybocki, Lance Ramshaw, Stephanie Strassel, and Ralph Weischedel. *The automatic content extraction (ACE) program – tasks, data, and evaluation*. In Proceedings of the Fourth International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC’04), Lisbon, Portugal. European Language Resources Association (ELRA), 2004.

2. **ERE Dataset**:
   - Citation:
     > Zhiyi Song, Ann Bies, Stephanie M. Strassel, Tom Riese, Justin Mott, Joe Ellis, Jonathan Wright, Seth Kulick, Neville Ryant, and Xiaoyi Ma. *From light to rich ERE: annotation of entities, relations, and events*. In Proceedings of the The 3rd Workshop on EVENTS: Definition, Detection, Coreference, and Representation, (EVENTS@HLP-NAACL), 2015.

After collecting this information, I will summarize the datasets in a structured manner, ensuring that I include the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations as required.

Finally, I will compile all the dataset entries into a structured output that is ready for further processing or review.
