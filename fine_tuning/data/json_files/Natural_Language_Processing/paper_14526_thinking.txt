To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Replicating Relevance-Ranked Synonym Discovery in a New Language and Domain" by Andrew Yates and Michael Unterkalmsteiner, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the use of data from the building construction domain, which suggests that there is a dataset involved. The introduction further elaborates on the replication of a method for synonym discovery, indicating that specific datasets are likely used for evaluation.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors describe their dataset in section 3.1, where they mention using synonyms defined in **CoClass** as the ground truth. They also discuss the corpus created for the study, which includes documents from various sources.

The key dataset identified is:

1. **CoClass**: This is a hierarchical classification system co-developed by the Swedish Transportation Agency and consultancy firms, intended for the life-cycle management of construction projects. The authors mention that they used the synonyms defined in CoClass as the ground truth for their synonym discovery task.

I will now check the **References section** to find the full citation for the CoClass dataset. The citation is as follows:

- CoClass (Sep 2018), https://coclass.byggtjanst.se/en/about

Additionally, the authors mention that they constructed a corpus from various sources, including the Swedish Wikipedia and documents from the Swedish Transportation Agency. However, they do not provide a specific name for this corpus, so I will not include it as a dataset entry.

Now that I have identified the relevant dataset and its citation, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. This includes ensuring that the citation is complete and accurately reflects the source of the dataset used in the research.
