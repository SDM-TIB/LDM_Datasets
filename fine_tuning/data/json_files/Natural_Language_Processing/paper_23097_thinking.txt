To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Arithmetic Reasoning with LLM: Prolog Generation & Permutation" by Xiaocheng Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and method sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the creation of the **GSM8K-Prolog dataset**, which is a strong indication that this is a key dataset in the research.

Next, I will examine **section 3 (Method)**, specifically **subsection 3.1 (GSM8K-Prolog Dataset)**, where the authors describe the dataset in detail. They explain that the GSM8K-Prolog dataset is curated from the GSM8K benchmark, which consists of diverse grade school math word problems. The authors also mention that they used OpenAIâ€™s Text Completion API to generate Prolog code solutions for these problems.

In this section, they provide the following details about the GSM8K-Prolog dataset:
- It contains arithmetic reasoning problems and their corresponding Prolog code solutions.
- The dataset was created in a semi-automatic manner, ensuring high quality and accuracy.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the GSM8K dataset, which is the source of the GSM8K-Prolog dataset. The citation for the GSM8K dataset is:
> Karl Cobbe, Vineet Kosaraju, Mohammad Bavarian, Mark Chen, Heewoo Jun, Lukasz Kaiser, Matthias Plappert, Jerry Tworek, Jacob Hilton, Reiichiro Nakano, Christopher Hesse, and John Schulman. *Training verifiers to solve math word problems*. In Proceedings of the 2021 Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS), 2021.

Now, I will compile the dataset information, ensuring to include the full citation for each dataset mentioned in the paper.

1. **GSM8K-Prolog Dataset**: This dataset is derived from the GSM8K benchmark and contains arithmetic reasoning problems along with their Prolog code solutions. It was created using OpenAI's Text Completion API and is open-sourced under the MIT license.

   Citation:
   > Karl Cobbe, Vineet Kosaraju, Mohammad Bavarian, Mark Chen, Heewoo Jun, Lukasz Kaiser, Matthias Plappert, Jerry Tworek, Jacob Hilton, Reiichiro Nakano, Christopher Hesse, and John Schulman. *Training verifiers to solve math word problems*. In Proceedings of the 2021 Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS), 2021.

After gathering this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for further processing or review.
