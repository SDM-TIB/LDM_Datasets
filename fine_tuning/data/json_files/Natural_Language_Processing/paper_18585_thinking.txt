To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Unified Hallucination Detection for Multimodal Large Language Models" by Xiang Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the introduction of a benchmark called **MHaluBench**, which suggests that this is a dataset relevant to the research.

Next, I will look for specific sections that detail datasets, such as a **Datasets** or **Methodology** section. In this paper, the authors describe **MHaluBench** in detail, indicating that it is a meta-evaluation benchmark designed for hallucination detection in multimodal large language models. 

In the **Construction of MHaluBench** section, the authors provide specifics about the dataset, including its composition and the tasks it covers. They mention that it includes 200 exemplars for image captioning (IC), 200 for visual question answering (VQA), and an additional 220 for text-to-image generation. This detailed breakdown confirms that **MHaluBench** is a significant dataset used in their experiments.

Additionally, the authors reference other datasets used in their work, such as:

1. **FactCC**: A dataset for evaluating factual consistency in text summarization.
2. **QAGS**: A dataset for assessing the quality of generated summaries.
3. **HaluEval**: A large-scale hallucination evaluation benchmark.
4. **POPE**: A dataset for evaluating object hallucination in large vision-language models.
5. **HaELM**: A dataset for evaluating hallucination detection methods.
6. **AMBER**: Another dataset related to hallucination detection.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the **References section** of the paper:

- **MHaluBench**: This is the authors' own dataset, so the citation will be:

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
