To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The ROOTS Search Tool: Data Transparency for LLMs" by Aleksandra Piktus et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the ROOTS corpus, which is described as a 1.6TB multilingual text corpus developed for training the BLOOM language model. This indicates that the ROOTS corpus is a significant dataset.

Next, I will look into **section 3 (The ROOTS corpus)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the ROOTS corpus. They mention that it consists of 1.6TB of data in 46 natural languages and 13 programming languages. This section confirms that the ROOTS corpus is the primary dataset discussed in the paper.

I will also check **section 3.1 (Data Governance)** and **section 3.2 (Data Pre-processing)** for any additional datasets or relevant details about the ROOTS corpus. However, it appears that the focus remains on the ROOTS corpus itself, with no other datasets explicitly mentioned.

Now, I will gather the full citation for the ROOTS corpus. The citation is found in the references section of the paper:

- For the ROOTS corpus, the citation is:

The bigscience ROOTS corpus: A 1.6TB composite multilingual dataset. In Thirty-Sixth Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems Datasets and Benchmarks Track.

Finally, I will compile the extracted dataset information, ensuring that I include the full citation for the ROOTS corpus as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the dataset discussed in the paper.
