To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Geometry Transfer for Stylizing Radiance Fields" by Hyunyoung Jung et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and while it may not explicitly mention datasets, it sets the context for the research. 

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as it typically contains detailed information about the datasets used for evaluation. In this paper, the authors mention two datasets:

1. **LLFF Dataset**: This dataset is described as comprising high-resolution captures of real-world, forward-facing scenes, which aligns with the context of 3D style transfer methods.

2. **ScanNet Dataset**: The authors state that this dataset includes multiple sequences of real-world indoor scenes characterized by varied trajectories and common furniture types, which is relevant for verifying the method's capability across different camera viewpoints.

To ensure accuracy, I will check the **References section** for full citations of these datasets:

- For the **LLFF Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Ben Mildenhall, Pratul P Srinivasan, Rodrigo Ortiz-Cayon, Nima Khademi Kalantari, Ravi Ramamoorthi, Ren Ng, and Abhishek Kar. *Local light field fusion: Practical view synthesis with prescriptive sampling guidelines*. ACM Transactions on Graphics (TOG), 38, 2019.

- For the **ScanNet Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Angela Dai, Angel X. Chang, Manolis Savva, Maciej Halber, Thomas Funkhouser, and Matthias Nie√üner. *ScanNet: Richly-annotated 3D reconstructions of indoor scenes*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2017.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets relevant to the research and their proper citations for reference.
