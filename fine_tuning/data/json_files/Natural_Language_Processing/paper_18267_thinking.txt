To extract datasets from the research paper titled "IndiText Boost: Text Augmentation for Low Resource India Languages" by Onkar Litake et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the work focuses on data augmentation for low-resource languages, specifically mentioning six Indian languages. This suggests that datasets related to these languages will be discussed.

Next, I will examine **section 3 (Dataset)**, which is likely to contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the research. Here, the authors list six datasets corresponding to the six Indian languages they focus on. I will carefully note the name of each dataset, its description, and any relevant details provided.

The datasets mentioned in the paper are:

1. **Sindhi Dataset**: This dataset consists of 3,364 articles categorized into sports, entertainment, and technology, sourced from awamiawaz.pk.

2. **Hostility Detection Dataset in Hindi**: This dataset contains 8,200 texts from social media, categorized into hostile and non-hostile classes, with further subdivisions for the hostile class.

3. **L3Cube-MahaHate - Marathi**: This dataset includes over 25,000 tweets labeled into four classes: hate, offensive, profane, and not-hate.

4. **Gujarati News Dataset**: This dataset comprises 6,500 news article headlines collected from Gujarati news websites, categorized into entertainment, business, and technology.

5. **Multi-domain Corpus for Sentiment Analysis - Telugu 2 Class**: This dataset contains 339 Telugu song lyrics, with 230 labeled as positive and 109 as negative.

6. **Telugu NLP - Telugu 5 Class**: This dataset is extracted from Telugu books and includes labels for business, editorial, entertainment, nation, and sport.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The citations for the datasets are as follows:

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
