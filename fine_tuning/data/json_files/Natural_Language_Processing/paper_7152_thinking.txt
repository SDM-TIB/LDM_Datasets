To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Estimation of Public Charging Demand using Cellphone Data and Points of Interest-based Segmentation" by Victor Radermecker and Prof. Lieselot Vanhaverbeke, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or data sources.

In the **introduction**, I will look for references to specific datasets or data collection methods that the authors used to estimate EV charging demand. The introduction often sets the stage for the research and may mention key datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly sections 3.1 and 3.2, where the authors describe their demand estimation and segmentation methods. Here, they mention the use of **cellular signaling data (CSD)** provided by Proximus S.A. This is a crucial dataset for the study, and I will extract its details.

The paper describes the CSD dataset as containing the total number of trips between specific origin and destination pairs, which is essential for estimating charging demand. I will note the specifics of this dataset, including the time frame of data collection and the methodology used for aggregation.

Additionally, I will look for any other datasets mentioned in the **results section** or throughout the paper, especially those related to the segmentation of charging demand based on points of interest (POIs). The authors mention using data from **OpenStreetMap (OSM)** to extract POIs, which is another important dataset.

Now, I will compile the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper:

1. **Cellular Signaling Data (CSD)**:
   - Dataset provided by Proximus S.A., one of Belgiumâ€™s largest telecommunication companies. The dataset includes the total number of trips between specific origins and destinations in Brussels, collected on workdays from January 20, 2020, to February 20, 2020.

2. **OpenStreetMap (OSM)**:
   - The data used for extracting points of interest (POIs) in Brussels, which includes various amenities such as educational institutions, shops, and healthcare facilities. The OSM data is community-driven and accessible for research purposes.

After identifying these datasets, I will ensure to document their details accurately, including the context in which they were used in the research. This will help in creating a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the study, which is crucial for reproducibility and further research.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for review, ensuring that I have captured all necessary information and citations accurately.
