To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Adversarial Alignment of Multilingual Models for Extracting Temporal Expressions from Text" by Lukas Lange et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the creation of a multilingual model, but I need to look for specific datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Evaluation Metrics and Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for training and evaluation. Here, they state that they used:

1. **Portuguese TimeBank**: This dataset is referenced as being used for training the multilingual models.
2. **TempEval3**: This dataset is mentioned for Spanish and English (specifically a subset of TimeBank).
3. **French TimeBank**: Used for evaluation purposes.
4. **Catalan TimeBank**: Also used for evaluation.
5. **Basque TimeBank**: Mentioned as part of the evaluation datasets.
6. **Zeit subset of the German KRAUTS corpus**: This is another dataset used for evaluation.

Now, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for each of these datasets:

- For **Portuguese TimeBank**, the citation is:
  > Costa, F., & Branco, A. (2012). TimeBankPT: A TimeML annotated corpus of Portuguese. In Proceedings of the Eighth International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC’12).

- For **TempEval3**, the citation is:
  > UzZaman, N., Llorens, H., Derczynski, L., Allen, J., Verhagen, M., & Pustejovsky, J. (2013). SemEval-2013 task 1: TempEval-3: Evaluating time expressions, events, and temporal relations. In Second Joint Conference on Lexical and Computational Semantics (*SEM), Volume 2: Proceedings of the Seventh International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval 2013).

- For **French TimeBank**, the citation is:
  > Bittar, A., Amsili, P., Denis, P., & Danlos, L. (2011). French TimeBank: An ISO-TimeML annotated reference corpus. In Proceedings of the 49th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies.

- For **Catalan TimeBank**, the citation is:
  > Saurı, R., & Badia, T. (2012). Catalan timebank 1.0 corpus documentation. Technical report.

- For **Basque TimeBank**, the citation is:
  > Altuna, B., Aranzabe, M. J., & Díaz de Ilarraza, A. (2016). Adapting TimeML to Basque: Event annotation. In International Conference on Intelligent Text Processing and Computational Linguistics.

- For **KRAUTS corpus**, the citation is:
  > Strötgen, J., Minard, A.-L., Lange, L., Speranza, M., & Magnini, B. (2018). KRAUTS: A German temporally annotated news corpus. In Proceedings of the Eleventh International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC 2018).

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their proper references.
