To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Mufﬁn: A Framework Toward Multi-Dimension AI Fairness" by Yi Sheng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions "case studies on dermatology datasets with two unfair attributes," which indicates that datasets are involved. I will look for specific names of these datasets.

Next, I will carefully read through **section 4 (Experiments)**, as this section typically contains detailed information about the datasets used in the experiments. In this section, the authors mention two datasets:

1. **ISIC2019 Dataset**: This dataset is referenced as being used for a classification task with 8 dermatology diseases. I will note down its details and look for the full citation in the references section.

2. **Fitzpatrick17K Dataset**: This dataset is mentioned as being used for classifying 9 classes of dermatological diseases. I will also note its details and check for its citation.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the complete citations for both datasets:

- For the **ISIC2019 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > "Skin lesion analysis." ISIC Archive. Available: https://challenge2019.isic-archive.com/.

- For the **Fitzpatrick17K Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Groh, M., et al. "Evaluating deep neural networks trained on clinical images in dermatology with the Fitzpatrick 17k dataset." In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 1820–1828, 2021.

Now that I have the names and citations of the datasets, I will summarize the information for each dataset, ensuring to include the full citation as required.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
