To extract datasets from the research paper titled "BlackMamba: Mixture of Experts for State-Space Models" by Quentin Anthony et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors trained their models on "300B tokens of a custom dataset," which indicates that datasets are involved, but I need to find specific names and details.

Next, I will focus on **section V (Design)**, where the authors describe the dataset used for training BlackMamba. Here, they mention that they constructed a custom dataset comprised of a mixture of existing open-source datasets. The specific datasets listed are:

1. **The Pile**: This dataset contains 800GB of diverse text for language modeling.
2. **SlimPajama**: A cleaned and deduplicated version of RedPajama, containing 627 billion tokens.
3. **Starcoder**: A dataset aimed at code generation, containing a significant amount of programming-related text.
4. **PeS2o**: A dataset for pretraining efficiently on S2ORC, which is a large-scale dataset for scientific papers.
5. **ProofPile**: A dataset focused on mathematical proofs and reasoning.
6. **PG19**: A dataset containing a variety of text sources.

The authors provide a table (Table I) that details the weights assigned to each dataset in the training mixture, which confirms their usage in the training process.

Now, I will check the **References section** to gather full citations for each of these datasets:

- For **The Pile**, the citation is:

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented and properly cited.
