To extract datasets from the research paper titled "OPT-IML: Scaling Language Model Instruction Meta Learning through the Lens of Generalization" by Srinivasan Iyer et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the creation of **OPT-IML Bench**, which suggests that multiple datasets are involved in the study.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly where the authors describe the construction of the OPT-IML Bench. They mention consolidating **2000 NLP tasks** from **8 existing benchmarks**, which indicates a significant number of datasets. I will look for specific names of these benchmarks and any datasets they reference.

In the **experiments section**, the authors detail the evaluation of their models on various benchmarks. They specifically mention the following datasets:

1. **Super-NaturalInstructions**: A benchmark that includes a large number of tasks with instructional prompts.
   - Citation: Wang, A., et al. (2022). *Super-NaturalInstructions: A Natural Language Processing Benchmark for Instruction Following*. In Proceedings of the 2022 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP).

2. **FLAN**: Another benchmark that consists of a diverse set of tasks designed for instruction tuning.
   - Citation: Wei, J., et al. (2022). *Finetuned Language Models are Zero-Shot Learners*. In International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR).

3. **PromptSource**: A repository of prompts for various NLP tasks.
   - Citation: Sanh, V., et al. (2022). *Multitask Prompted Training Enables Zero-Shot Task Generalization*. In International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR).

4. **UniﬁedSKG**: A collection of tasks related to structured knowledge grounding.
   - Citation: Xie, T., et al. (2022). *UniﬁedSKG: Unifying and Multi-Tasking Structured Knowledge Grounding with Text-to-Text Language Models*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2201.05966.

Additionally, the authors mention the inclusion of reasoning datasets, which are critical for their experiments. They list **14 reasoning datasets** that contribute to their analysis.

Now, I will compile the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring that I include all necessary details for proper referencing.

After gathering all this information, I will summarize the datasets in a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly identified along with its citation for future reference.
