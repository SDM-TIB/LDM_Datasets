To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Pythia: A Suite for Analyzing Large Language Models" by Stella Biderman et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors provide public access to **154 checkpoints** for each of the 16 models trained on public data, which suggests that there are datasets involved.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **methodology** and **experiments** sections. In the introduction, the authors mention training on **the Pile**, a curated collection of English language datasets. This is a significant dataset that I need to document.

In **section 2.2 (Training Data)**, the authors provide a detailed description of **the Pile** dataset, stating that it is popular for training large autoregressive transformers and has been widely used by state-of-the-art models. They also mention that it is freely and publicly available, which is crucial for reproducibility.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for **the Pile** dataset. The citation provided is:
> Gao, L., Biderman, S., Black, S., Golding, L., Hoppe, T., Foster, C., Phang, J., He, H., Thite, A., Nabeshima, N., Presser, S., and Leahy, C. *The Pile: An 800GB dataset of diverse text for language modeling*. Computing Research Repository, 2020. doi: 10.48550/arXiv.2101.00027. URL https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.00027v1.

Additionally, I will look for any other datasets mentioned in the **case studies** or **experiments** sections. The authors reference benchmarks like **WinoBias** and **CrowS-Pairs** in their analysis of gender bias, which are also important datasets to include.

For **WinoBias**, the citation is:
> Zhao, J., Wang, T., Yatskar, M., Ordonez, V., and Chang, K.-W. *Gender bias in coreference resolution: Evaluation and debiasing methods*. In Proceedings of the 2018 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, Volume 2 (Short Papers), pp. 15–20, 2018.

For **CrowS-Pairs**, the citation is:
> Nangia, N., Vania, C., Bhalerao, R., and Bowman, S. R. *CrowS-pairs: A challenge dataset for measuring social biases in masked language models*. In Proceedings of the 2020 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), pp. 1953–1967, Online, November 2020.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
