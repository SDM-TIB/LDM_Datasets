To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Imputation with Inter-Series Information from Prototypes for Irregular Sampled Time Series" by Zhihao Yu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors conducted experiments on three datasets, which indicates that I should look for their names and details.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. They list three datasets:

1. **PhysioNet Challenge 2012**: This dataset is referenced as a source for irregularly sampled time series data. The authors provide a brief description of its statistics, including the number of samples, variables, total length, maximum length, minimum length, and observation rate.

2. **PhysioNet Challenge 2019**: Similar to the 2012 challenge, this dataset is also used for experiments on irregularly sampled time series. The authors provide comparable statistics to those of the 2012 dataset.

3. **Human Activity Dataset**: This dataset is mentioned as another source for their experiments. The authors again provide statistics relevant to this dataset.

To ensure I have the full citations for these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **PhysioNet Challenge 2012**, the citation is:
  > Goldberger, A. L., Amaral, L. A. N., Glass, L., Hausdorff, J. M., Ivanov, P. C., Mark, R. G., Mietus, J. E., Moody, G. B., Peng, C. K., & Stanley, H. E. (2000). Physiobank, physiotoolkit, and physionet: components of a new research resource for complex physiologic signals. *Circulation*, 101(23), e215-e220.

- For **PhysioNet Challenge 2019**, the citation is:
  > Reyna, M. A., Josef, C., Seyedi, S., Jeter, R., Shashikumar, P. S., Westover, M. B., Sharma, A., Nemati, S., & Clifford, G. D. (2019). Early prediction of sepsis from clinical data: the PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology Challenge 2019. *2019 Computing in Cardiology (CinC)*, 2019, 1-5.

- For **Human Activity Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Cao, W., Wang, D., Li, J., Zhou, H., Li, L., & Li, Y. (2018). BRITS: Bidirectional recurrent imputation for time series. *Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems*, 31, 2018.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. Each dataset will be described with its name, a brief description, and the full citation.
