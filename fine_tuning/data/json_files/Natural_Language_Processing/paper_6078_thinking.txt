To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Overlap-based Vocabulary Generation Improves Cross-lingual Transfer Among Related Languages" by Vaidehi Patil et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** to see if any datasets are mentioned or referenced. The abstract discusses the use of multilingual language models and mentions experiments on multiple NLP tasks and datasets, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors describe their experiments in section 4, where they evaluate their proposed method (Overlap BPE) on various tasks. I will pay close attention to any specific datasets mentioned in this section.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention several datasets used for their experiments:

1. **WikiANN**: This dataset is used for Named Entity Recognition (NER) tasks. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Pan, X., Zhang, B., May, J., Nothman, J., Knight, K., & Ji, H. (2017). Cross-lingual name tagging and linking for 282 languages. In Proceedings of the 55th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers), pages 1946–1958, Vancouver, Canada. Association for Computational Linguistics.

2. **XTREME**: This dataset is used for various tasks including NER and XNLI. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Hu, J., Ruder, S., Siddhant, A., Neubig, G., Firat, O., & Johnson, M. (2020). XTREME: A massively multilingual multi-task benchmark for evaluating cross-lingual generalisation. In Proceedings of the 37th International Conference on Machine Learning, volume 119 of Proceedings of Machine Learning Research, pages 4411–4421. PMLR.

3. **TDIL**: This dataset is used for POS tagging and text classification tasks. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Technology Development for Indian Languages (TDIL). (n.d.). Retrieved from https://www.tdil-dc.in

4. **Samanantar**: This dataset is used for perplexity evaluation in the experiments. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Ramesh, G., Doddapaneni, S., Bheemaraj, A., Jobanputra, M., & Khapra, M. M. (2021). Samanantar: The largest publicly available parallel corpora collection for 11 Indic languages.

Next, I will ensure that I have the full citations for each dataset, as this is crucial for proper documentation. I will compile the dataset information, including their names and citations, into a structured format for easy reference.

Finally, I will summarize the findings and prepare the dataset entries for any further processing or review.
