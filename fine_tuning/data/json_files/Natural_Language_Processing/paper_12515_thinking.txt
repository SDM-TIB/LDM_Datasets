To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Contrastive Knowledge Amalgamation for Unsupervised Image Classification" by Shangde Gao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research but may not list specific datasets. The introduction may give context about the datasets used, while the experiments section typically contains detailed information about the datasets employed in the study.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors mention evaluating their proposed method on four widely used benchmarks. Here, they provide a table (Table 1) summarizing the statistics of the datasets used, which is crucial for my extraction process.

The datasets listed in Table 1 are:

1. **CUB-200-2011**: Contains 11,788 images across 200 categories, with a train/test split of 5,994/5,794.
2. **Stanford Dogs**: Comprises 20,580 images across 120 categories, with a train/test split of 12,000/8,580.
3. **Stanford Cars**: Includes 16,185 images across 196 categories, with a train/test split of 8,144/8,041.
4. **FGVC-Aircraft**: Contains 102,000 images across 200 categories, with a train/test split of 6,667/3,333.

Now, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:

- For **CUB-200-2011**, the citation is:
  > Wah, C., Branson, S., Welinder, P., Perona, P., Belongie, S. (2011). *The Caltech-UCSD Birds-200-2011 Dataset*.

- For **Stanford Dogs**, the citation is:
  > Khosla, A., Jayadevaprakash, N., Yao, B., Li, F.F. (2011). *Novel dataset for fine-grained image categorization: Stanford dogs*. In: Proc. CVPR workshop on fine-grained visual categorization (FGVC).

- For **Stanford Cars**, the citation is:
  > Krause, J., Stark, M., Deng, J., Fei-Fei, L. (2013). *3D object representations for fine-grained categorization*. In: 2013 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision Workshops.

- For **FGVC-Aircraft**, the citation is:
  > Maji, S., Rahtu, E., Kannala, J., Blaschko, M., Vedaldi, A. (2013). *Fine-grained visual classification of aircraft*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1306.5151.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described with its corresponding citation. This structured approach will help in organizing the datasets effectively for further analysis or processing.
