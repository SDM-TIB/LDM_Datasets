To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Making Data Work Count" by Srravya Chandhiramowuli et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on data annotation and counting practices, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. The introduction elaborates on the importance of data annotation in AI development, but again, no specific datasets are named.

Next, I will examine the **methods section** where the authors describe their ethnographic study conducted at two annotation centers in India. Here, they mention various annotation projects but do not provide specific dataset names. Instead, they focus on the processes and practices involved in data annotation.

I will then look into the **findings section** to see if any datasets are referenced in the context of the projects discussed. The authors describe several annotation tasks and the counting practices involved, but they do not specify any datasets used for these tasks.

Finally, I will check the **references section** to see if any datasets are cited indirectly through the works referenced. However, the references primarily consist of scholarly articles and books that discuss broader themes related to data annotation and counting, rather than specific datasets.

After thoroughly reviewing the paper, it appears that the authors do not explicitly mention any datasets by name. Instead, they focus on the practices and implications of data annotation work without providing specific dataset citations.

Since no datasets are identified in the paper, I will not be able to provide full citations for datasets as there are none to extract. My final step will be to summarize my findings, noting the absence of specific datasets in the research paper.
