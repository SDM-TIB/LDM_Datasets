To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Probing Semantic Grounding in Language Models of Code with Representational Similarity Analysis" by Shounak Naik et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract states that the authors use data from the **IBM CodeNet dataset** for their experiments, which indicates that this dataset is significant for their research.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for any additional context or details about the datasets. The introduction discusses the importance of language models and mentions the use of big code datasets, but it primarily reiterates the focus on the IBM CodeNet dataset.

Moving on to **section 3 (Experimental Setup)**, I will look for a detailed description of the dataset. Here, the authors explicitly mention that they use the **IBM CodeNet dataset**, which comprises 4000 coding problems with submissions in multiple programming languages. They describe how the dataset is structured, including the natural language (NL) and programming language (PL) modalities, and provide insights into how they filtered and prepared the data for their experiments.

In **section 3.1 (Dataset)**, the authors provide specific details about the dataset, including the number of samples for each programming language and how they cleaned and translated the problem descriptions. This section confirms that the IBM CodeNet dataset is the primary dataset used in their experiments.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the IBM CodeNet dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:
> Puri, R., Kung, D.S., Janssen, G., Zhang, W., Domeniconi, G., Zolotov, V., Dolby, J., Chen, J., Choudhury, M., Decker, L., Thost, V., Buratti, L., Pujar, S., Ramji, S., Finkler, U., Malaika, S., Reiss, F. (2021). *CodeNet: A large-scale AI for code dataset for learning a diversity of coding tasks*. In Thirty-fifth Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems Datasets and Benchmarks Track (Round 2). https://openreview.net/forum?id=6vZVBkCDrHT

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the findings:

1. **IBM CodeNet Dataset**: This dataset is central to the experiments conducted in the paper. It consists of 4000 coding problems with submissions in multiple programming languages, structured as natural language and programming language pairs.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly presents the dataset and its citation for further use or analysis.
