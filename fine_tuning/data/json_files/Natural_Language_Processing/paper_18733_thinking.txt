To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Estimating Barycenters of Distributions with Neural Optimal Transport" by Alexander Kolesov et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper, as these sections typically provide insights into the datasets used in the research. The abstract mentions the applicability of the proposed method on "illustrative scenarios and image data setups," which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section (Section 5)**, where the authors describe various experiments conducted to evaluate their method. Here, they mention specific datasets used for testing their approach. For instance, they refer to the **CelebA dataset** in the context of the "Ave, celeba!" barycenter benchmark, which is a clear indication of a dataset being utilized.

I will also look for any references to datasets in the **background or related works sections**, as these may provide additional context or mention other datasets that were used in prior studies.

Upon identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research. 

For example, the paper mentions the **MNIST dataset** for handwritten digits, which is a well-known dataset. The citation for the MNIST dataset is:
> Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Chris Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998.

Additionally, the **CelebA dataset** is referenced, and its citation is:
> Ziwei Liu, Ping Luo, Xiaogang Wang, and Xiaoou Tang. *Deep Learning Face Attributes in the Wild*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 3730â€“3738, 2015.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described clearly and that the full citations are included for reference.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format, ready for further processing or review.
