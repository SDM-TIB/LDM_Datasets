To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Context-aware Neural Machine Translation for English-Japanese Business Scene Dialogues" by Sumire Honda et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions the adaptation of a pretrained mBART model and the use of multi-sentence dialogue data, which suggests that datasets are involved. The introduction further emphasizes the need for datasets that capture discourse phenomena in English-Japanese translation, hinting at specific datasets being utilized.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used in their research. Here, they identify two main datasets:

1. **Business Scene Dialogue corpus (BSD)**: This dataset is described as the primary dataset used for their experiments. It consists of business scene dialogues with various scenarios and includes speaker information and scene tags, which are crucial for their context-aware translation approach.

2. **AMI Meeting Parallel Corpus (AMI)**: This dataset is used as a supplemental dataset for comparison. It contains translations of meeting recordings and is noted for its shorter utterances compared to BSD.

I will also check the **data split statistics** provided in the paper to understand the structure and size of each dataset, which is important for contextualizing their use in the experiments.

After identifying the datasets, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For the **Business Scene Dialogue corpus (BSD)**, the citation is:
> Rikters, M., Ri, R., Li, T., & Nakazawa, T. (2019). Designing the business conversation corpus. In Proceedings of the 6th Workshop on Asian Translation, pages 54–61, Hong Kong, China. Association for Computational Linguistics.

For the **AMI Meeting Parallel Corpus (AMI)**, the citation is:
> Rikters, M., Ri, R., Li, T., & Nakazawa, T. (2020). Document-aligned Japanese-English conversation parallel corpus. In Proceedings of the Fifth Conference on Machine Translation, pages 637–643, Online. Association for Computational Linguistics.

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This structured approach will help in organizing the information effectively for further processing or review.
