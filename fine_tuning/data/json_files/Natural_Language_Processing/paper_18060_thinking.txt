To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "MambaTab: A Simple Yet Effective Approach for Handling Tabular Data" by Md Atik Ahamed and Qiang Cheng, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors validated their method on **diverse benchmark datasets**, which indicates that datasets are involved. 

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors provide a detailed list of the datasets used for their experiments. This section is crucial as it typically contains the names, abbreviations, and statistics of the datasets.

In **Table 1**, the authors list 8 public datasets along with their abbreviations and some statistics. The datasets mentioned are:

1. **Credit-g (CG)**: 1000 data points.
2. **Credit-approval (CA)**: 690 data points.
3. **Dresses-sales (DS)**: 48842 data points.
4. **Adult (AD)**: 540 data points.
5. **Cylinder-bands (CB)**: 7043 data points.
6. **Blastchar (BL)**: 5822 data points.
7. **Insurance-co (IO)**: 32561 data points.
8. **Income-1995 (IC)**: 200 data points.

I will also check **Supplementary Table 1**, which provides external links to access these datasets. This is important for ensuring that I can provide full citations and access information.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset from the references section or the supplementary materials. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- **Credit-g**: 
  > OpenML. *Credit-g Dataset*. Available at: https://www.openml.org/d/31

- **Credit-approval**: 
  > UCI Machine Learning Repository. *Credit Approval Dataset*. Available at: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/credit+approval

- **Dresses-sales**: 
  > OpenML. *Dresses Sales Dataset*. Available at: https://www.openml.org/d/23381

- **Adult**: 
  > OpenML. *Adult Dataset*. Available at: https://www.openml.org/d/1590

- **Cylinder-bands**: 
  > OpenML. *Cylinder Bands Dataset*. Available at: https://www.openml.org/d/6332

- **Blastchar**: 
  > Kaggle. *Telco Customer Churn Dataset*. Available at: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn

- **Insurance-co**: 
  > UCI Machine Learning Repository. *Insurance Company Benchmark (COIL 2000) Dataset*. Available at: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Insurance+Company+Benchmark+%28COIL+2000%29

- **Income-1995**: 
  > Kaggle. *Income Classification Dataset*. Available at: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lodetomasi1995/income-classification

After compiling this information, I will ensure that each dataset is described accurately and that the citations are formatted correctly for inclusion in any further documentation or analysis. This structured approach will help in maintaining clarity and thoroughness in the dataset extraction process.
