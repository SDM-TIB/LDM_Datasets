To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Millimeter-wave Radio SLAM: End-to-End Processing Methods and Experimental Validation" by Elizaveta Rastorgueva-Foi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned or referenced. The abstract indicates that the authors provide "measured 60 GHz data openly available for the research community," which suggests that there is a dataset available.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In the introduction, the authors discuss the importance of measurement data for their proposed methods, which implies that they likely provide details about the datasets used.

Upon reviewing the **experiments section**, I will look for specific mentions of datasets. The authors state that they release "the complete 60 GHz I/Q measurement data set as well as the corresponding processed channel parameter data set." This indicates that there are at least two datasets available.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The paper mentions that the datasets are openly shared along with the final published article, which means I need to ensure I have the correct citation format for these datasets.

1. **60 GHz I/Q Measurement Data Set**: This dataset is described as being openly available for the research community. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Elizaveta Rastorgueva-Foi, Jukka Turunen, Ossi Kaltiokallio, Bo Tan, Yu Ge, Matias Valkama, and Henk Wymeersch. *Millimeter-wave Radio SLAM: End-to-End Processing Methods and Experimental Validation*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC), 2023.

2. **Processed Channel Parameter Data Set**: This dataset is also mentioned as being openly available. The citation for this dataset is the same as above since both datasets are released together:
   > Elizaveta Rastorgueva-Foi, Jukka Turunen, Ossi Kaltiokallio, Bo Tan, Yu Ge, Matias Valkama, and Henk Wymeersch. *Millimeter-wave Radio SLAM: End-to-End Processing Methods and Experimental Validation*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC), 2023.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations. This will ensure that the datasets are properly documented and can be referenced accurately in future work.
