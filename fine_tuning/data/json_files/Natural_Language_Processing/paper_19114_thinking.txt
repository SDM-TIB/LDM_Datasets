To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Bridging the Empirical-Theoretical Gap in Neural Network Formal Language Learning Using Minimum Description Length" by Nur Lan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, and the introduction often outlines the context and previous work, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **experiments**. In many research papers, authors will describe the datasets used for their experiments in a specific section, often labeled as "Datasets" or "Experimental Setup." This section typically contains detailed information about the datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

In this paper, I will pay special attention to any mention of datasets related to formal language learning or neural network training. If the authors refer to specific datasets, I will note their names and any relevant details provided.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial as it allows for proper attribution and further exploration of the datasets if needed.

For example, if the authors mention a dataset like "anbn" or any other formal language dataset, I will ensure to find the original source or paper that introduced it. I will also look for any datasets that may have been created or used by the authors themselves, as they may provide a unique contribution to the field.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.

Finally, I will ensure that the citations are formatted correctly and include all necessary details such as authors, title, publication venue, and year, so that they can be easily referenced by others.

By following these steps, I will be able to extract and document the datasets from the paper effectively.
