To extract datasets from the research paper titled "360◦REA: Towards A Reusable Experience Accumulation with 360◦ Assessment for Multi-Agent System" by Shen Gao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** sections to get an overview of the paper's objectives and any references to datasets. The abstract mentions "extensive experiments on complex task datasets," which indicates that datasets are involved, but I need to find specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **Methodology section** and specifically look for any subsections that discuss datasets. In this paper, the authors mention two tasks: **creative writing** and **travel plan making**. I will look for the datasets associated with these tasks.

In **section 4.1 (Tasks and Datasets)**, the authors explicitly state the datasets used for their experiments:

1. **Trivia Creative Writing Dataset**: This dataset contains 100 samples, where each sample requires generating a story based on specific input questions.

2. **Trip Planning Dataset**: This dataset comprises travel plans for 50 world-famous attractions, including various fields such as destination, basic requirements, duration of travel, season, type of travelers, number of travelers, and budget.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

- For the **Trivia Creative Writing Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Wang, G., Xie, J., & Su, Y. (2023). *TravelPlanner: A Benchmark for Real-World Planning with Language Agents*. In Proceedings of the 61st Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers), pages 13484–13508, Toronto, Canada. Association for Computational Linguistics.

- For the **Trip Planning Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Xie, J., Zhang, K., Chen, J., Zhu, T., Lou, R., Tian, Y., & Su, Y. (2024). *TravelPlanner: A Benchmark for Real-World Planning with Language Agents*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2402.13408.

With these citations in hand, I will now compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
