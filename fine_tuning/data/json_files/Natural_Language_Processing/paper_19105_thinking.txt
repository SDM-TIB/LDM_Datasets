To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Risk-Sensitive Soft Actor-Critic for Robust Deep Reinforcement Learning under Distribution Shifts" by Tobias Enders et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for experiments or evaluations.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors often discuss the context of their research and may reference datasets that are relevant to their work. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or benchmarks that the authors compare their results against.

Then, I will examine the **experiments section** in detail, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. I will look for any subsections specifically dedicated to datasets, which may provide detailed descriptions, including the number of samples, types of data, and any relevant characteristics.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

For example, if the authors mention using a dataset like "MuJoCo" for their experiments, I will look for the original paper or source that describes this dataset and note its citation.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for any required output format, ensuring that all information is clear and well-organized for future reference or analysis.
