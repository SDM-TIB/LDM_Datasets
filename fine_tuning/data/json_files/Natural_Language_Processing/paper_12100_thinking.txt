To extract datasets from the research paper titled "POWERFUSION: A Tensor Compiler with Explicit Data Movement Description and Instruction-level Graph IR" by Zixuan Ma et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract discusses the evaluation of POWERFUSION on various hardware platforms but does not specify any datasets. The introduction also focuses on the performance of DNNs and tensor compilers without naming specific datasets.

Next, I will examine the **evaluation section** (Section 8) where the authors describe their experiments. Here, they mention evaluating POWERFUSION on seven different models, including BERT, GPT-2, ViT, SAR-DRN, EfficientNet, ShuffleNet, and RedNet-50. However, they do not explicitly mention any datasets used for training or testing these models.

I will also check the **references section** to see if any datasets are cited indirectly through the papers referenced. The references include various works related to the models evaluated, but they do not provide specific datasets.

Since the paper does not explicitly mention any datasets, I will note that while the models are well-known, the datasets used for training or evaluation are not specified in this paper. 

In conclusion, I will compile my findings as follows:

- **Datasets**: None explicitly mentioned in the paper.
- **Models Evaluated**: BERT, GPT-2, ViT, SAR-DRN, EfficientNet, ShuffleNet, RedNet-50.
- **References for Models**: 
  - BERT: Devlin et al. (2018) - "BERT: pre-training of deep bidirectional transformers for language understanding."
  - GPT-2: Radford et al. (2019) - "Language models are unsupervised multitask learners."
  - ViT: Dosovitskiy et al. (2021) - "An image is worth 16x16 words: Transformers for image recognition at scale."
  - SAR-DRN: Zhang et al. (2018) - "Learning a dilated residual network for sar image despeckling."
  - EfficientNet: Tan and Le (2020) - "Efficientnet: Rethinking model scaling for convolutional neural networks."
  - ShuffleNet: Zhang et al. (2018) - "ShuffleNet: An extremely efficient convolutional neural network for mobile devices."
  - RedNet-50: Li et al. (2021) - "Involution: Inverting the inherence of convolution for visual recognition."

Since no datasets are explicitly mentioned, I will summarize that the paper focuses on model performance rather than specific datasets used in the experiments.
