To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Dynamic-SUPERB: Towards a Dynamic, Collaborative, and Comprehensive Instruction-Tuning Benchmark for Speech," I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the paper presents a benchmark called Dynamic-SUPERB, which features 55 evaluation instances by combining 33 tasks and 22 datasets. This indicates that multiple datasets are involved, and I need to identify them.

Next, I will look into **section 2 (Dynamic-SUPERB)**, particularly the subsections that discuss the objectives and datasets. Here, the authors mention that they gathered over 20 publicly available English datasets and transformed them into a diverse set of tasks. They specifically mention **LibriSpeech**, **LJSpeech**, and **VCTK** as widely-used corpora sourced for various tasks.

In **section 2.4 (Task format)**, the authors elaborate on how these datasets are utilized in different tasks. They clarify that a dataset can correspond to multiple tasks, and they provide examples of how **LibriSpeech** is used for speaker verification and spoken term detection.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The citations I need to extract are:

1. **LibriSpeech**:
   > Vassil Panayotov et al., “LibriSpeech: An ASR corpus based on public domain audio books,” in ICASSP, 2015.

2. **LJSpeech**:
   > Keith Ito and Linda Johnson, “The LJ Speech Dataset,” https://keithito.com/LJ-Speech-Dataset/, 2017.

3. **VCTK**:
   > Junichi Yamagishi, Christophe Veaux, and Kirsten MacDonald, “CSTR VCTK Corpus: English multi-speaker corpus for CSTR voice cloning toolkit (version 0.92),” 2019.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ready for review or further processing.
