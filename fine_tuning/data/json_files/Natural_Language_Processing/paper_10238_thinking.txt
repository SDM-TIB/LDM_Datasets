To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Context-Aware Semantic Similarity Measurement for Unsupervised Word Sense Disambiguation" by Jorge Martinez-Gil, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the research evaluates a proposed method on a benchmark dataset, which suggests that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will focus on the **results section**, specifically **section 5 (Results)**, where the author discusses the dataset used for evaluation. Here, the paper explicitly mentions the **CoarseWSD-20 dataset**. The author describes it as a dataset for determining the meanings of words that can have multiple meanings, derived from Wikipedia, and containing 10,196 cases focused on 20 words with varying senses.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the CoarseWSD-20 dataset. The citation provided in the references is:

- For **CoarseWSD-20 dataset**:
  > Loureiro, D., Rezaee, K., Pilehvar, M.T., Camacho-Collados, J. *Analysis and evaluation of language models for word sense disambiguation*. Computational Linguistics, 47(2), 387â€“443 (2021). https://doi.org/10.1162/coli_a_00405

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the findings:

1. **CoarseWSD-20 Dataset**: This dataset is designed for word sense disambiguation tasks, focusing on 20 words with multiple meanings, and contains 10,196 instances. It is particularly useful for evaluating WSD models.

With this information, I can now prepare the dataset entry for further processing or documentation.
