To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Instruction-Guided Bullet Point Summarization of Long Financial Earnings Call Transcripts" by Subhendu Khatuya et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of the **ECTSum dataset**, which is a strong indication that this dataset is central to the research.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **introduction**. Here, the authors discuss the challenges of summarizing Earnings Call Transcripts (ECTs) and reference the **ECTSum dataset** as a benchmark for their proposed method. This confirms that the dataset is indeed utilized in their experiments.

In the **methodology section**, the authors provide more details about the **ECTSum dataset**, stating that it contains **2,425 ECT report-summary pairs** and is split into train, validation, and test sets. This section solidifies the importance of the dataset in their research.

I will also check the **results section** to see if the authors mention any other datasets or provide further context about the **ECTSum dataset**. They confirm that all supervised methods are trained on the train set of the **ECTSum dataset** and evaluated on the test set, reiterating its significance.

Finally, I will consult the **references section** to find the full citation for the **ECTSum dataset**. The relevant citation is:

- For **ECTSum dataset**:
  > Rajdeep Mukherjee, Abhinav Bohra, Akash Banerjee, Soumya Sharma, Manjunath Hegde, Afreen Shaikh, Shivani Shrivastava, Koustuv Dasgupta, Niloy Ganguly, Saptarshi Ghosh, and Pawan Goyal. 2022. ECTSum: A New Benchmark Dataset For Bullet Point Summarization of Long Earnings Call Transcripts. In Proceedings of the 2022 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, Yoav Goldberg, Zornitsa Kozareva, and Yue Zhang (Eds.). Association for Computational Linguistics, Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, 10893â€“10906. https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2022.emnlp-main.748

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will prepare to compile this information into the required structured format for further processing or review.
