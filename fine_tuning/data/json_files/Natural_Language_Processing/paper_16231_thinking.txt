To extract datasets from the research paper titled "LIP-RTVE: An Audiovisual Database for Continuous Spanish in the Wild" by David Gimeno-Gómez and Carlos-D. Martínez-Hinarejos, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information and provide full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are introduced or referenced. The abstract mentions the creation of a semi-automatically annotated audiovisual database for Spanish, which indicates that a dataset is indeed present.

Next, I will look into **section 3 (LIP-RTVE Database)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset they compiled. This section outlines the characteristics of the LIP-RTVE database, including its duration, number of speakers, and the nature of the data collected. It is crucial to note that this section will likely contain the most comprehensive details about the dataset.

In **section 4.1 (Data Sets)**, the authors describe the dataset partitions for both speaker-dependent (SD) and speaker-independent (SI) scenarios. They provide specific details about the training, development, and testing sets, which are essential for understanding how the dataset is structured and utilized in experiments.

I will also check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned in the paper. The authors reference the RTVE database as the source of their data, which is crucial for proper citation. The citation for the RTVE database is as follows:
> Lleida, E., Ortega, A., Miguel, A., Bazán, V., Pérez, C., Gómez, M., and de Prada, A. (2018). RTVE2018 database description. Online Available: http://catedrartve.unizar.es/reto2018/RTVE2018DB.pdf.

Additionally, I will look for any other datasets mentioned in the related work or methodology sections that may be relevant to the research. For example, the authors reference other audiovisual databases like VLRF and CMU-MOSEAS, which may also need to be cited.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will involve summarizing the key characteristics of the LIP-RTVE database and any other relevant datasets, along with their citations.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format that is ready for review or further processing, ensuring that all citations are accurate and complete.
