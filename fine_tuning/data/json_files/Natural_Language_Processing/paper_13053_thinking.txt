To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MEDOE: A Multi-Expert Decoder and Output Ensemble Framework for Long-tailed Semantic Segmentation" by Junao Shen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their framework on **Cityscapes** and **ADE20K** datasets, which suggests these are the primary datasets used in their experiments.

Next, I will look for explicit mentions of these datasets in the **experiments section**. In the experiments, the authors state that they conducted extensive evaluations on both **Cityscapes** and **ADE20K**, confirming their use in the study. They also provide performance metrics for these datasets, which further emphasizes their significance in the research.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. 

For **Cityscapes**, the citation is:
> Marius Cordts, Mohamed Omran, Sebastian Ramos, Timo Rehfeld, Markus Enzweiler, Rodrigo Benenson, Uwe Franke, Stefan Roth, and Bernt Schiele. *The Cityscapes Dataset for Semantic Urban Scene Understanding*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 3213–3223, 2016.

For **ADE20K**, the citation is:
> Bolei Zhou, Hang Zhao, Xavier Puig, Sanja Fidler, Adela Barriuso, and Antonio Torralba. *Scene Parsing Through ADE20K Dataset*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 633–641, 2017.

Having gathered the necessary information, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **Cityscapes**: A dataset focused on semantic understanding of urban street scenes, containing 5K finely annotated images and 20K coarsely annotated images.
2. **ADE20K**: A challenging scene parsing dataset that includes 150 categories and diverse scenes, with 20K training images and 2K validation images.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries with their full citations, ensuring that all information is accurately represented for future reference or processing.
