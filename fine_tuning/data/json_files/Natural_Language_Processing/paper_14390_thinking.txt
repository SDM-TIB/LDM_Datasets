To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Mechanical Artifacts in Optical Projection Tomography: Classification and Automatic Calibration" by Yan Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's contributions, but I need to look for specific datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **results and discussion sections** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for validation and testing. In this paper, the authors mention using **simulated data** and **experimental data** from a fluorescent textile fiber. I will look for more details about these datasets.

In the **section discussing simulation and experimental results**, the authors describe the use of a simulated OPT system with random errors and an experimental dataset of a fluorescent textile fiber. However, they do not provide specific names or citations for these datasets directly in the text.

To ensure I have the correct citations, I will check the **References section** for any papers that might describe the datasets used. The authors reference several works, but I need to identify which ones correspond to the datasets mentioned.

1. **Simulated Data**: The authors describe using a forward imaging model to generate projections for their simulations. However, they do not provide a specific citation for this simulated dataset, as it is generated based on their own modeling.

2. **Experimental Data**: The authors mention the experimental dataset of a fluorescent textile fiber but do not provide a specific citation for this dataset either. They refer to their own work in the references, particularly reference [15], which is their own paper. This indicates that the experimental data may be part of their study.

Now, I will compile the information I have gathered:

- For the **simulated dataset**, since it is generated by the authors, I will note that it does not have a formal citation.
  
- For the **experimental dataset**, I will cite the paper itself as it is the source of the data:
  > Yan Liu, Jonathan Dong, Thanh-An Pham, François Marelli, and Michael Unser. *Mechanical Artifacts in Optical Projection Tomography: Classification and Automatic Calibration*. Opt. Continuum, vol. 1, no. 12, pp. 2577–2589, Dec 2022. [Online]. Available: https://opg.optica.org/optcon/abstract.cfm?URI=optcon-1-12-2577

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets in a structured format, ensuring that I include the necessary citations for the experimental dataset while noting the nature of the simulated dataset.
