To extract datasets from the research paper titled "NORMMARK: A Weakly Supervised Markov Model for Socio-cultural Norm Discovery" by Farhad Moghimifar et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their model on a dataset with limited norm annotations, which suggests that a specific dataset is being used. The introduction provides context about the need for socio-cultural norm discovery, but I need to look for explicit mentions of datasets.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (section 4) closely, as this is typically where datasets are described in detail. In this section, the authors state that they used the **LDC2022E20** dataset for their experiments. They provide a brief description of this dataset, noting that it consists of 13,074 segments of dialogues in Mandarin Chinese, which were transcribed from text, audio, and video documents.

I will also look for any additional datasets mentioned in the paper, but it appears that LDC2022E20 is the primary dataset used for evaluation. The authors detail how the dataset is split into training, testing, and development sets, which is important for understanding its structure.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the LDC2022E20 dataset. The citation is typically formatted according to the guidelines of the conference or journal, and I need to ensure I capture it accurately.

The citation for the LDC2022E20 dataset is:
> LDC2022E20. *Linguistic Data Consortium*. 2022. 

This citation indicates that the dataset is part of the resources provided by the Linguistic Data Consortium, which is a reputable source for linguistic datasets.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the dataset details, including its name, description, and citation, ensuring that I adhere to the required format for clarity and completeness.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format that can be easily reviewed or processed further.
