To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Attention-Based Real-Time Defenses for Physical Adversarial Attacks in Vision Applications" by Giulio Rossolini et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets along with their full citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental evaluation sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of the proposed defense mechanism through extensive experiments, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental evaluation section (Section VI)**, where the authors describe their experimental settings. They mention using two approaches for evaluation:

1. **CARLA simulator**: The authors state that they utilized the CarlaGear framework, which provides 9 photo-realistic scenarios for testing. This indicates that the CARLA simulator is a dataset used for their experiments.

2. **Cityscapes dataset**: The authors mention generating custom videos that include digital adversarial attacks using three extended sequences from the Cityscapes dataset. This dataset is specifically noted for its images sized at 2048x1024 pixels and is used to test the whole ACAT framework.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **CARLA simulator**, the citation is:
  > Dosovitskiy, A., Ros, G., Codevilla, F., LÃ³pez, A. M., & Koltun, V. (2017). *CARLA: an open urban driving simulator*. In 1st Annual Conference on Robot Learning (Vol. 78, pp. 1-16). PMLR.

- For the **Cityscapes dataset**, the citation is:
  > Cordts, M., Omran, M., Ramos, S., Rehfeld, T., Enzweiler, M., Benenson, R., Franke, U., Roth, S., & Schiele, B. (2016). *The cityscapes dataset for semantic urban scene understanding*. In Proceedings of the IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition (pp. 3213-3223).

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes its full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details regarding the datasets used in the research paper.
