To extract datasets from the research paper titled "TrafficVLM: A Controllable Visual Language Model for Traffic Video Captioning" by Quang Minh Dinh et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors achieved notable results in the AI City Challenge 2024, which suggests that they likely used specific datasets for their experiments.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for fine-tuning and evaluation. They state that they utilized the **WTS dataset** and also reference the **BDD100K dataset**. 

In **section 4.1**, the authors provide details about the WTS dataset, describing it as containing 155 scenarios and 810 videos from both fixed overhead cameras and vehicle cameras. This section also mentions that the dataset includes annotations capturing the location, attention, behavior, and context information of both vehicles and pedestrians.

Now, I will look for the full citations of these datasets in the **References section**:

1. For the **WTS dataset**, the citation is:
   > Quan Kong, Yuki Kawana, Rajat Saini, Ashutosh Kumar, Jingjing Pan, Ta Gu, Yohei Ozao, Balazs Opra, David C. Anastasiu, Yoichi Sato, and Norimasa Kobori. *WTS: A pedestrian-centric traffic video dataset for fine-grained spatial-temporal understanding*. 2024.

2. For the **BDD100K dataset**, the citation is:
   > Fisher Yu, Haofeng Chen, Xin Wang, Wenqi Xian, Yingying Chen, Fangchen Liu, Vashisht Madhavan, and Trevor Darrell. *BDD100K: A diverse driving dataset for heterogeneous multitask learning*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 2633â€“2642, 2020.

Having gathered the necessary information, I will now compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will allow for a structured output that can be used for further analysis or processing.
