To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Instructive Feature Enhancement for Dichotomous Medical Image Segmentation" by Lian Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the construction of a large-scale dataset called **Cosmos55k**, which is a strong indication that this dataset is central to the research. The introduction further elaborates on this dataset, stating that it contains 55,023 images from 7 modalities and 26 anatomical structures.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any relevant sections that provide more details about Cosmos55k. In this paper, the dataset is described in the **experiments section**, where the authors explain how they constructed Cosmos55k by collecting and processing images from 30 publicly available datasets. This section provides essential details about the dataset's composition and purpose.

Now, I will identify the specific datasets that contributed to the creation of Cosmos55k. The authors list 30 publicly available datasets in the acknowledgments section, which I will need to reference for full citations. I will compile the names of these datasets and their corresponding citations from the references section of the paper.

The datasets mentioned include:
1. **AbdomenCT-1K**
2. **ACDC**
3. **AMOS 2022**
4. **BraTS20**
5. **CHAOS**
6. **CRAG**
7. **cross-MoDA**
8. **EndoTect 2020**
9. **ETIS-Larib Polyp DB**
10. **iChallenge-AMD**
11. **iChallenge-PALM**
12. **IDRiD 2018**
13. **ISIC 2018**
14. **I2CVB**
15. **KiPA22**
16. **KiTS19 & KiTS21**
17. **Kvasir-SEG**
18. **LUNA16**
19. **Multi-Atlas Labeling Beyond the Cranial Vault (Abdomen)**
20. **Montgomery County CXR Set**
21. **M&Ms**
22. **MSD**
23. **NCI-ISBI 2013**
24. **PROMISE12**
25. **QUBIQ 2021**
26. **SIIM-ACR**
27. **SLIVER07**
28. **VerSe19 & VerSe20**
29. **Warwick-QU**
30. **WORD**

Next, I will look up the full citations for these datasets in the references section of the paper. This will ensure that I have the correct and complete citations for each dataset.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will summarize the findings for the **Cosmos55k dataset** and the individual datasets that contributed to it, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly presents each dataset, its description, and its citation, ready for further processing or review.
