To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Reproducibility Study on Quantifying Language Similarity: The Impact of Missing Values in the URIEL Knowledge Base" by Hasti Toossi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, results, and conclusion sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on the URIEL knowledge base, which aggregates linguistic information for various languages. This suggests that URIEL itself is a dataset of interest.

Next, I will look closely at **section 2 (Methodology for Reproducibility)**, where the authors describe the URIEL knowledge base in detail. They mention that URIEL aggregates linguistic information for **4,005 languages** from various data sources, which indicates that URIEL is a significant dataset used in their analysis.

In this section, the authors also reference several data sources that contribute to URIEL, including:

1. **WALS (World Atlas of Language Structures)**: A database that provides typological information about the world's languages.
2. **SSWL (Syntactic Structures of the World’s Languages)**: A resource that contains syntactic information.
3. **PHOIBLE**: A database of phonological inventories of the world's languages.
4. **Ethnologue**: A comprehensive reference work cataloging all of the world's known living languages.
5. **Glottolog**: A bibliographic database of the world's languages, language families, and dialects.

I will also check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets and data sources. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the means to access the original datasets.

The full citations for the datasets and data sources mentioned in the paper are as follows:

- **WALS**:
  > Matthew S. Dryer and Martin Haspelmath, editors. *WALS Online (v2020.3)*. Zenodo, 2013.

- **SSWL**:
  > Hilda Koopman. *Syntactic structures of the world’s languages (SSWL)*. Hemendik hartua: http://SSWL.railsplayground.net/, 2009.

- **PHOIBLE**:

- **Glottolog**:
  > Harald Hammarström, Robert Forkel, Martin Haspelmath, and Sebastian Bank. *Glottolog 4.8*, 2023.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented and properly cited for future reference. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
