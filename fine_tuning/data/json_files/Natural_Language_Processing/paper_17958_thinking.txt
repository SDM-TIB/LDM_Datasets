To extract datasets from the research paper titled "STRUCTSUM Generation for Faster Text Comprehension" by Parag Jain et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract mentions the use of the **SQuAD dataset** for verifying the adequacy of their proposed AUTO-QA method, which indicates that this dataset is relevant.

Next, I will look for any additional datasets in the **experiments and data generation sections**. In section 7, the authors describe their data generation process and mention that they used the **WIKI40B dataset** as the source for input passages. This dataset is crucial for understanding the context of their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. **SQuAD Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Pranav Rajpurkar, Jian Zhang, Konstantin Lopyrev, and Percy Liang. *SQuAD: 100,000+ questions for machine comprehension of text*. In Proceedings of the 2016 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 2383â€“2392, Austin, Texas. Association for Computational Linguistics.

2. **WIKI40B Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Mandy Guo, Zihang Dai, Denny Vrandecic, and Rami Al-Rfou. *Wiki-40b: Multilingual language model dataset*. In LREC 2020.

Having identified the datasets and their citations, I will now compile this information into a structured format for clarity and future reference. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their respective citations.
