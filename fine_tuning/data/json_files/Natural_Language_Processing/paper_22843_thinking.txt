To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Explaining Graph Neural Networks via Structure-aware Interaction Index" by Ngoc Bui et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. In the abstract, the authors mention conducting extensive experiments on various graph datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed used in their research. I will look for specific names or descriptions of these datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 6), where the authors provide detailed information about the datasets used. Here, they explicitly list ten datasets commonly used in graph explainability literature. I will carefully note each dataset mentioned, along with any relevant details provided.

The datasets identified in the experiments section are:

1. **BA-2Motifs**: A binary classification task involving Barabási-Albert base structures linked with either a house or five-cycle motif.
   - Citation: Luo et al. (2020). *GNNExplainer: Generating Explanations for Graph Neural Networks*. Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems.

2. **BA-HouseGrid**: Similar to BA-2Motifs but with two distinct motifs, house and 3 × 3 grid.
   - Citation: Amara et al. (2023). *Graphframex: Towards systematic evaluation of explainability methods for graph neural networks*. Learning on Graph Conference.

3. **SPMotif**: Contains graphs combining a base structure (Tree, Ladder, or Wheel) and a motif (Cycle, House, Crane).
   - Citation: Wu et al. (2022). *Explaining Graph Neural Networks via Non-parametric Subgraph Matching*. International Conference on Machine Learning.

4. **BA-HouseAndGrid**: Each graph is a Barabási structure that may link with either house or grid motifs.
   - Citation: Amara et al. (2023). *Graphframex: Towards systematic evaluation of explainability methods for graph neural networks*. Learning on Graph Conference.

5. **BA-HouseOrGrid**: Similar to BA-HouseAndGrid, but graphs with either house or grid motifs are labeled as 1.
   - Citation: Amara et al. (2023). *Graphframex: Towards systematic evaluation of explainability methods for graph neural networks*. Learning on Graph Conference.

6. **Mutagenic**: A molecular property prediction task to identify if a molecule is mutagenic or not.
   - Citation: Kazius et al. (2005). *Derivation and validation of toxicophores for mutagenicity prediction*. Journal of Medicinal Chemistry.

7. **Benzene**: Contains molecular graphs to determine the presence of benzene rings in a molecule.
   - Citation: Sanchez-Lengeling et al. (2020). *Evaluating attribution for graph neural networks*. Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems.

8. **MNIST75SP**: An image classification dataset where each image in MNIST is converted to a superpixel graph.
   - Citation: Monti et al. (2017). *Geometric deep learning on graphs and manifolds using mixture model CNNs*. Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition.

9. **GraphSST2**: A sentiment classification task where each node corresponds to one word in the text.
   - Citation: Yuan et al. (2022). *On explainability of graph neural networks via subgraph explorations*. International Conference on Machine Learning.

10. **Twitter**: Another sentiment classification task with a similar structure to GraphSST2.
    - Citation: Yuan et al. (2022). *On explainability of graph neural networks via subgraph explorations*. International Conference on Machine Learning.

After identifying these datasets, I will ensure to compile the full citations accurately as they are crucial for proper referencing.

Finally, I will summarize the extracted datasets along with their citations in a structured format for easy reference and further processing.
