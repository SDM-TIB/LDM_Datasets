To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-modal Instruction Tuned LLMs with Fine-grained Visual Perception" by Junwen He et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the model achieves state-of-the-art results across multiple benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved. I will look for specific mentions of datasets in these sections.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the advancements in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) and their capabilities, but I need to find explicit references to datasets. 

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly the subsection titled **3.2. Implementation Details**. Here, the authors outline the datasets used for training and evaluation. They mention several datasets:

1. **COCO-Stuff**: Used for general semantic and instance segmentation.
2. **ADE20K**: Another dataset for semantic segmentation.
3. **PACO-LVIS**: Utilized for instance segmentation.
4. **RefClef, RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, RefCOCOg, and PhraseCut**: These datasets are used for referring expression segmentation.
5. **Flickr30K Entities**: Mentioned for region-level captioning.
6. **AVSBench**: Used for audio-visual segmentation.

I will also check the **experiments section** to confirm that these datasets are indeed used for evaluation and to gather any additional context about their application.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution. 

The citations I will look for include:

- For **COCO-Stuff**:
  > Holger Caesar, Jasper Uijlings, and Vittorio Ferrari. *Coco-stuff: Thing and stuff classes in context*. In Proceedings of the IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pages 1209–1218, 2018.

- For **ADE20K**:
  > Bolei Zhou, Hang Zhao, Xavier Puig, Tete Xiao, Sanja Fidler, Adela Barriuso, and Antonio Torralba. *Semantic understanding of scenes through the ade20k dataset*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 127:302–321, 2019.

- For **PACO-LVIS**:
  > Vignesh Ramanathan et al. *PACO: Parts and attributes of common objects*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2301.01795, 2023.

- For **RefClef, RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, RefCOCOg**:
  > Sahar Kazemzadeh et al. *Referitgame: Referring to objects in photographs of natural scenes*. In Proceedings of the 2014 conference on empirical methods in natural language processing (EMNLP), pages 787–798, 2014.

  > Bryan A. Plummer et al. *Flickr30k entities: Collecting region-to-phrase correspondences for richer image-to-sentence models*. IJCV, 123(1):74–93, 2017.

- For **AVSBench**:
  > Jinxing Zhou et al. *Audio–visual segmentation*. In European Conference on Computer Vision, pages 386–403. Springer, 2022.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research.
