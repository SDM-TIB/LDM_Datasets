To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "A Comparative Study of Neural Network Models for Sentence Classification" by Phuong Le-Hong and Anh-Cuong Le, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study involves two sentence classification datasets for English and Vietnamese text, which suggests that datasets are present.

Next, I will focus on **section III (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used in their study. In this section, they mention two datasets:

1. **UIUC English Question Classification Dataset**: This dataset contains 5,952 manually labeled questions categorized into 6 coarse-grained classes and 50 fine-grained classes. It is noted that 500 questions are reserved for testing.

2. **vnExpress Sentence Dataset**: This dataset consists of 20,000 Vietnamese sentences extracted from the vnExpress online newspaper, labeled into five categories: "education," "entertainment," "devices," "health," and "business." The dataset is split into a training set of 16,000 sentences and a test set of 4,000 sentences.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper. The authors reference the UIUC dataset in their discussion of previous works, specifically citing:

- For the **UIUC English Question Classification Dataset**, the citation is:
  > X. Li and D. Roth, “Learning question classifiers,” in Proceedings of COLING, 2002, pp. 556–569.

The vnExpress dataset does not have a specific citation in the references, but it is described as being extracted from the vnExpress online newspaper. Since it is a proprietary dataset, I will note that it does not have a formal citation.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the UIUC dataset and note the vnExpress dataset appropriately.

After completing this process, I will have a clear and organized representation of the datasets used in the study, ready for further processing or review.
