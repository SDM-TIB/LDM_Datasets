To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Quantifying and Enhancing Multi-Modal Robustness with Modality Preference" by Zequn Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the method demonstrates improvements on "three real-world multi-modal datasets," which indicates that datasets are indeed used.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for validation. In this section, they explicitly mention three datasets:

1. **Kinetics-Sounds Dataset**: This dataset is described as containing 22,000 10-second video clips across 31 human action classes. It is noted that the videos are manually annotated for human action.

2. **UCF101 Dataset**: This dataset consists of 13,320 videos from 101 action classes, typically regarded as a multi-modal dataset with RGB and optical flow modalities.

3. **VGGSound Dataset**: This dataset contains 168,618 videos used for training and validation, covering 309 classes of audio events in everyday life.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:

- For **Kinetics-Sounds Dataset**:
  > Relja Arandjelovic and Andrew Zisserman. *Look, listen and learn*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision, pp. 609–617, 2017.

- For **UCF101 Dataset**:
  > Khurram Soomro, Amir Roshan Zamir, and Mubarak Shah. *UCF101: A dataset of 101 human actions classes from videos in the wild*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1212.0402, 2012.

  > Honglie Chen, Weidi Xie, Andrea Vedaldi, and Andrew Zisserman. *VGGSound: A large-scale audio-visual dataset*. In ICASSP 2020-2020 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP), pp. 721–725. IEEE, 2020.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will prepare to format this information according to the required structure for further processing or review.
