To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Flare7K++: Mixing Synthetic and Real Datasets for Nighttime Flare Removal and Beyond" by Yuekun Dai et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant details and provide full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions the introduction of **Flare7K++**, which consists of two components: **Flare-R** (real-captured flare images) and **Flare7K** (synthetic flare images). This indicates that both datasets are crucial for the research.

Next, I will look into **section 4 (Flare7K++ Dataset)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets. Here, I will find specific information about each dataset:

1. **Flare7K**: This dataset is composed of 7,000 synthetic flare images, which include 5,000 scattering flares and 2,000 reflective flares. The authors describe the generation process and the types of flares included.

2. **Flare-R**: This dataset consists of 962 real-captured flare images obtained under various conditions using different smartphone cameras. The authors detail how these images were captured and the types of lens contaminants used to create the flares.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for both datasets. The citations are essential for proper attribution and to guide readers to the original sources.

For **Flare7K**, the citation is:
> Yuekun Dai, Chongyi Li, Shangchen Zhou, Ruicheng Feng, and Chen Change Loy. *Flare7K: A phenomenological nighttime flare removal dataset*. In Thirty-sixth Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems Datasets and Benchmarks Track, 2022.

For **Flare-R**, since it is part of the same paper, I will use the same citation as above, as it is introduced in the context of the Flare7K++ dataset.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset, its description, and the corresponding citation. This will ensure that I have accurately captured all necessary details for future reference or processing.
