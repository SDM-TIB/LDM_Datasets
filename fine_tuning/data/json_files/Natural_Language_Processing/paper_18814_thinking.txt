To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Limitations of Agents Simulated by Predictive Models" by Raymond Douglas et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a high-level overview, but I will need to delve deeper into the body of the paper for specific dataset details.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the adaptation of predictive models into agent-like systems and mention the importance of training data. However, they do not specify any datasets at this point.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4), where the authors describe their methodology and the datasets used for their experiments. Here, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names and descriptions.

Upon reviewing Section 4.1, I find that the authors created a synthetic dataset for the **Padlock game**, which consists of trajectories of expert plays. They describe how the dataset is structured, including the initial state of the levers and the actions taken by experts to reach a target configuration.

In Section 4.2, the authors mention a dataset used for the **Tic-Tac-Toe game**, which consists of all possible game trajectories. They provide details about how the dataset is encoded and the structure of the game.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. However, since the datasets are synthetic and created by the authors for their experiments, they may not have formal citations like publicly available datasets.

For the **Padlock game dataset**, I will document it as follows:
- **Dataset Name**: Padlock Game Dataset
- **Description**: A synthetic dataset of trajectories from a game where players attempt to open a padlock with a secret configuration of levers. The dataset includes sequences of actions taken by experts to reach the target configuration.

For the **Tic-Tac-Toe dataset**, I will document it similarly:
- **Dataset Name**: Tic-Tac-Toe Game Dataset
- **Description**: A dataset consisting of all possible game trajectories in Tic-Tac-Toe, encoded as sequences of states and actions.

Since these datasets are not publicly available and are created for the purpose of the experiments in this paper, they do not have formal citations. However, I will note that they are derived from the authors' experimental designs.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for clarity and future reference.
