To extract datasets from the research paper titled "EEGFormer: Towards Transferable and Interpretable Large-Scale EEG Foundation Model" by Yuqi Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their model on various downstream tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental results section**, specifically the **Datasets Description** subsection. Here, the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for pretraining and evaluation:

1. **Temple University EEG Corpus (TUH Corpus)**: This dataset is highlighted as a large-scale collection of over 1.7TB of unlabelled EEG data suitable for pretraining.

2. **TUAB Corpus**: This dataset is used for detecting whether an EEG signal is normal or abnormal.

3. **TUAR Corpus**: This dataset contains annotations of five different artifacts.

4. **TUSL Corpus**: This dataset includes annotations of slowing events.

5. **TUSZ Corpus**: This dataset contains annotations of seizure events.

6. **Neonate Dataset**: This dataset is used for neonatal seizure detection and is noted to be distinct from the TUH dataset.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Temple University EEG Corpus (TUH Corpus)**, the citation is:
  > Harati, A., Lopez, S., Obeid, I., Picone, J., Jacobson, M., and Tobochnik, S. (2014). *The TUH EEG CORPUS: A big data resource for automated EEG interpretation*. In 2014 IEEE signal processing in medicine and biology symposium (SPMB), 1–5. IEEE.

- For the **Neonate Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Stevenson, N. J., Tapani, K., Lauronen, L., and Vanhatalo, S. (2019). *A dataset of neonatal EEG recordings with seizure annotations*. Scientific data, 6(1): 1–8.

The other datasets (TUAB, TUAR, TUSL, TUSZ) are mentioned in the context of their use in the paper but do not have specific citations provided in the references. Therefore, I will note that they are derived from the TUH Corpus and do not have separate citations.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for the datasets that have them, and prepare them for structured output as needed. This will ensure that all relevant information is captured accurately and comprehensively.
