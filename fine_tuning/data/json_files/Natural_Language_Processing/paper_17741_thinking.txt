To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MLCA-AVSR: Multi-Layer Cross Attention Fusion Based Audio-Visual Speech Recognition" by He Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the proposed system was evaluated on the **MISP2022-AVSR Challenge dataset**, which indicates that this dataset is significant for the research.

Next, I will look for specific details about the dataset in the **experiments section**. In section 3.1, the authors describe the dataset used for their experiments. They mention that the **MISP2022-AVSR dataset** is a large-scale audio-visual Chinese conversational corpus consisting of 141 hours of audio and video data collected in various real-home TV room scenarios. This section provides essential details about the dataset's size and context.

I will also check the **data processing section** for any additional information about how the dataset was prepared or utilized, but the primary dataset of interest is already identified.

Now, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citation for the MISP2022-AVSR dataset. The relevant citation is:

- For **MISP2022-AVSR dataset**, the citation is:
  > Hang Chen, Jun Du, Yusheng Dai, Chin Hui Lee, Sabato Marco Siniscalchi, Shinji Watanabe, Odette Scharenborg, Jingdong Chen, et al. "Audio-visual speech recognition in MISP2021 challenge: Dataset release and deep analysis." In Proceedings of Interspeech, ISCA, 2022, pp. 1766â€“1770.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and full citation in the required format.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for output, ensuring it is structured correctly for any downstream processing or review.
