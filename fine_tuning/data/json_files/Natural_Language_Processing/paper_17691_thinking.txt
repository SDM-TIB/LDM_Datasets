To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ICE-GRT: Instruction Context Enhancement by Generative Reinforcement based Transformers" by Chen Zheng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract discusses the ICE-GRT model and its performance on various tasks, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. However, the introduction highlights the importance of appropriate data for training the model, which suggests that datasets will be discussed later in the paper.

Next, I will examine **section 4 (Experimental Details)**, particularly **subsection 4.1 (Data Collection)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for training the ICE-GRT model. Here, they mention two distinct datasets:

1. **ICE-Instruct Dataset**: This dataset is generated by the ICE-Instruct model, where for each prompt, five diverse responses are created and then ranked by human annotators. This dataset is crucial for training the reward model and is characterized by its diversity and comprehensive coverage of various scenarios.

2. **GPT-4-LLM Dataset**: This dataset includes ranked responses from GPT-4 and GPT-3.5, which were automatically assessed by GPT-4. The authors note that this dataset was used for comparative analysis but did not perform as well as the ICE-Instruct dataset in terms of training effectiveness.

In **section 5 (Results and Analysis)**, the authors further elaborate on the performance of the ICE-GRT model using these datasets, confirming their significance in achieving superior results.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. However, since the datasets are generated from models and not traditional datasets with published citations, I will note that the ICE-Instruct dataset is proprietary to the authors' work and does not have a formal citation. The GPT-4-LLM dataset is also not a standalone dataset with a citation but is referenced in the context of the GPT-4 model.

To summarize, the datasets extracted from the paper are:

1. **ICE-Instruct Dataset**: A proprietary dataset generated by the ICE-Instruct model, characterized by diverse responses and human rankings.
2. **GPT-4-LLM Dataset**: A dataset of ranked responses from GPT-4 and GPT-3.5, used for comparative analysis.

Since these datasets do not have formal citations, I will note that they are derived from the authors' methodologies and the models referenced in the paper.

Finally, I will compile the information about these datasets into a structured format for clarity and future reference.
