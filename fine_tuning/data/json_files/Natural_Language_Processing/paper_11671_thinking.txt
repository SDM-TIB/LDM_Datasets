To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Vietnamese multi-document summary using subgraph selection approach" by Huu-Thin Nguyen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that experiments were conducted on a Vietnamese dataset published in the VLSP Evaluation Campaign 2022, which suggests that there is a specific dataset involved.

Next, I will look into **section 3 (Experiments and Results)**, where the authors provide details about the dataset. They mention that the data includes Vietnamese news items on various topics, divided into training, validation, and test datasets. The description indicates that each cluster consists of 3-5 documents on the same topic, and that reference abstractive summaries are provided for the training and validation datasets.

In this section, I will also check for any specific names or identifiers for the dataset. The authors refer to the dataset as the "VLSP 2022 AbMuSu dataset," which is crucial for citation purposes.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citation for the VLSP 2022 AbMuSu dataset. The relevant reference is:

- For the **VLSP 2022 AbMuSu dataset**, the citation is:
  > Mai-Vu Tran, Hoang-Quynh Le, Duy-Cat Can, and Quoc-An Nguyen. *VLSP 2022 â€“ AbMuSu Challenge: Vietnamese Abstractive Multi-document Summarization*. In Proceedings of the 9th International Workshop on Vietnamese Language and Speech Processing (VLSP 2022).

After gathering this information, I will summarize the dataset details, ensuring to include the full citation as required.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format that is ready for review or further processing, ensuring that all necessary information is accurately represented.
