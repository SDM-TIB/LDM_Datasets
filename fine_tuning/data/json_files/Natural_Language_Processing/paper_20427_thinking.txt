To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Pre-Trained Language Models Represent Some Geographic Populations Better Than Others" by Jonathan Dunn et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the study's focus and any datasets that might be referenced. The abstract mentions the use of "geo-referenced corpora," which suggests that there are specific datasets involved in the analysis.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methods** or **results** sections. In this paper, the authors describe the use of a dataset derived from geo-referenced tweets collected from 927 airports around the world. This dataset is crucial for their spatial probing task.

I will note the details of the dataset:
1. **Geo-Referenced Tweets Dataset**: This dataset consists of tweets collected from 927 airports, representing the surrounding metropolitan areas. It includes 86,186 sub-corpora, each with an average of approximately 3,910 words. The authors emphasize that this dataset allows for a comparative analysis of language model performance across different geographic populations.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The authors reference their own previous work regarding the collection of geographic corpora, which is essential for understanding the dataset's origins. The relevant citation is:

- For the Geo-Referenced Tweets Dataset:
  > Dunn, Jonathan, and Adams, Benjamin. (2020). "Geographically-balanced Gigaword corpora for 50 language varieties." In Proceedings of the Language Resources and Evaluation Conference, pages 2528–2536. European Language Resources Association.

After gathering this information, I will ensure that I have accurately captured the dataset's name, description, and citation. This will allow me to compile the dataset entries in a structured format for further use.

In summary, I will document the following dataset:
- **Dataset Name**: Geo-Referenced Tweets Dataset
- **Description**: A dataset consisting of tweets collected from 927 airports around the world, representing the surrounding metropolitan areas, with 86,186 sub-corpora for analysis.
- **Full Citation**: Dunn, Jonathan, and Adams, Benjamin. (2020). "Geographically-balanced Gigaword corpora for 50 language varieties." In Proceedings of the Language Resources and Evaluation Conference, pages 2528–2536. European Language Resources Association.

This structured approach ensures that I have thoroughly extracted and documented the relevant datasets from the research paper.
