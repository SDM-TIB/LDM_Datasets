To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MORBDD: Multiobjective Restricted Binary Decision Diagrams by Learning to Sparsify" by Rahul Patel et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets used for experiments or evaluations.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (which is often where datasets are detailed). In this paper, I will look for any specific datasets used in the experiments, particularly in sections that describe the computational setup or the problem instances. The authors mention that they conduct experiments on multiobjective knapsack instances, which suggests that there may be specific datasets or instances they created or used.

I will also check the **results section** for any references to datasets, as authors often summarize their findings based on the datasets they used. If the datasets are not explicitly named, I will look for descriptions that could help me identify them.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for the datasets used in the research.

In this paper, the authors describe the generation of multiobjective knapsack instances, which are created from a discrete uniform distribution. I will note that while they do not reference a specific dataset from an external source, the methodology for generating these instances is important.

Hereâ€™s how I will summarize the datasets:

1. **Multiobjective Knapsack Instances**: The authors generated instances with varying numbers of objectives and items, specifically sizes (7, 40), (4, 50), and (3, 80). They created 1000 training instances, 100 validation instances, and 100 test instances for each size.

Since these instances are generated rather than sourced from an existing dataset, I will note that the authors have created their own dataset for the purpose of this research.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the necessary citations for any referenced works or methodologies used in the creation of the datasets.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for review, ensuring that all relevant details are captured accurately and that the citations are complete and correctly formatted.
