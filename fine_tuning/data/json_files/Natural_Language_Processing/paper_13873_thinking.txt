To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Multi-scale Generalized Shrinkage Threshold Network for Image Blind Deblurring in Remote Sensing" by Yujie Feng et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often discusses the context and relevance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention the need for image deblurring techniques in remote sensing and hint at the datasets used for evaluation. However, I need to look for specific dataset names and details.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly the subsection that discusses the datasets. Here, the authors explicitly mention three datasets used in their experiments:

1. **AIRS Dataset**: This dataset consists of more than 1,000 aerial images with a spatial resolution of 0.075 m/pixel and a size of 10000 × 10000 pixels.

2. **AID Dataset**: This dataset is composed of 10,000 aerial images, each with a size of 600 × 600 pixels and a spatial resolution of 0.5 m/pixel. It includes 30 distinct land-use categories, such as airports, farmland, beaches, and deserts.

3. **WHU-RS19 Dataset**: This dataset consists of 1005 remote sensing images, each with a size of 600 × 600 pixels and a maximum spatial resolution of 0.5 m/pixel. These images contain 19 distinct land types, including airports, bridges, mountains, and rivers.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations of these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and further exploration of the datasets.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **AIRS Dataset**:
  > Chen, Q., Wang, L., Wu, Y., Guo, G., Zhang, S. L., & Waslander, S. L. (2019). Temporary removal: Aerial imagery for roof segmentation: A large-scale dataset towards automatic mapping of buildings. *ISPRS Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing*, 147, 42-55.

- For the **AID Dataset**:
  > Xia, G.-S., Hu, J., Hu, F., Shi, B., Bai, X., Zhong, Y., Zhang, L., & Lu, X. (2017). AID: A benchmark data set for performance evaluation of aerial scene classification. *IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing*, 55(7), 3965-3981.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
