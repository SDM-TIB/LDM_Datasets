To extract datasets from the research paper titled "GauFRe: Gaussian Deformation Fields for Real-time Dynamic Novel View Synthesis" by Yiqing Liang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the method and its applications, while the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the research, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for validation and comparison of their method. In this section, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, characteristics, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

In the paper, the authors mention two datasets:

1. **D-NeRF Dataset**: This dataset consists of monocular exocentric 360° recordings of 8 dynamic synthetic objects with large motions and realistic materials. It is specifically used for training and rendering at half resolution (400 × 400) with a white background.

2. **NeRF-DS Dataset**: This dataset is formed of real-world dynamic scene sequences containing specular objects captured with a handheld camera. It is used to evaluate the performance of the proposed method against other state-of-the-art techniques.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to guide readers to the original sources.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **D-NeRF Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Albert Pumarola, Enric Corona, Gerard Pons-Moll, and Francesc Moreno-Noguer. *D-nerf: Neural radiance fields for dynamic scenes*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 10318–10327, 2021.

- For the **NeRF-DS Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Zhiwen Yan, Chen Li, and Gim Hee Lee. *Nerf-ds: Neural radiance fields for dynamic specular objects*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 8285–8295, 2023.

Now that I have gathered all necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This structured approach will help in accurately documenting the datasets used in the research paper.
