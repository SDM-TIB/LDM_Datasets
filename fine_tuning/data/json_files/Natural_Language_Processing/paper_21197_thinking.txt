To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Robust Concept Erasure Using Task Vectors" by Minh Pham et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned or referenced. The abstract discusses the concept of concept erasure in text-to-image models, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine **section 5 (Experiments)**, as this section typically contains information about the datasets used for experiments. I will look for any specific datasets that the authors used to evaluate their methods. 

In the experiments section, the authors mention using the **MNIST dataset** for their toy model experiments. This dataset is commonly used for handwritten digit recognition tasks and is a well-known benchmark in machine learning.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the MNIST dataset. The citation for the MNIST dataset is:
> Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *MNIST handwritten digit database*. ATT Labs [Online]. Available: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist, 2010.

Additionally, I will look for any other datasets mentioned in the paper. The authors refer to using **Stable Diffusion 1.4** in their experiments, which is a model rather than a dataset. However, they also mention using synthetic images generated from the model as part of their methodology, but these do not constitute a separate dataset with a citation.

After reviewing the paper, it appears that the primary dataset referenced is the MNIST dataset. I will compile this information into a structured format, ensuring to include the full citation.

In summary, the steps I took were:
1. Read through the abstract and introduction for initial mentions of datasets.
2. Focus on the experiments section to identify specific datasets used.
3. Locate the full citation for the identified dataset in the references section.

Now, I will prepare the dataset entry for the MNIST dataset based on the information gathered.
