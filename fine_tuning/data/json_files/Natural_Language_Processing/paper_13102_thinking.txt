To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Event-Guided Procedure Planning from Instructional Videos with Text Supervision" by An-Lan Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that extensive experiments were conducted on three datasets, which indicates that I should look for specific dataset names and details.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention three datasets:

1. **CrossTask**: This dataset contains instructional videos collected for 83 different events, divided into 18 primary and 65 related events. It includes 2,750 videos with an average of 7.6 actions per video.

2. **Narrated Instructional Videos (NIV)**: This dataset is collected from real-world instructional videos available on the Internet. It consists of 150 videos covering five events, with an average of 9.5 actions per video.

3. **COIN**: This is a large labeled instructional video dataset collected from YouTube, consisting of 11,827 videos related to 778 different actions, with an average of 3.6 actions per video.

To confirm the details of these datasets, I will also check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **CrossTask**, the citation is:
  > Dimitri Zhukov, Jean-Baptiste Alayrac, Ramazan Gokberk Cinbis, David Fouhey, Ivan Laptev, and Josef Sivic. *Cross-task weakly supervised learning from instructional videos*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2019.

- For **NIV**, the citation is:
  > Jean-Baptiste Alayrac, Piotr Bojanowski, Nishant Agrawal, Josef Sivic, Ivan Laptev, and Simon Lacoste-Julien. *Unsupervised learning from narrated instruction videos*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2016.

- For **COIN**, the citation is:
  > Antoine Miech, Jean-Baptiste Alayrac, Lucas Smaira, Ivan Laptev, Josef Sivic, and Andrew Zisserman. *End-to-end learning of visual representations from uncurated instructional videos*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2020.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
