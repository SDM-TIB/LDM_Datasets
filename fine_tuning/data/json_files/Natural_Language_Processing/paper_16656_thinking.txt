To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The Multiverse of Dynamic Mode Decomposition Algorithms" by Matthew J. Colbrook, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

1. **Read the Paper Thoroughly**: I will start by reading through the entire paper, paying close attention to sections that typically mention datasets, such as the **Introduction**, **Methods**, **Results**, and **Discussion**. I will also look for any tables or figures that might summarize datasets.

2. **Identify Explicit Mentions of Datasets**: As I read, I will highlight any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, descriptions, and any relevant details such as the number of samples, types of data, and the context in which they were used.

3. **Check for References to Previous Works**: I will look for any references to datasets that may have been used in previous studies or papers. This could include datasets that are well-known in the field or those that have been cited in the references section.

4. **Locate Full Citations**: For each dataset identified, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citation. This is crucial for proper attribution and for readers who may want to access the datasets.

5. **Summarize Each Dataset**: I will create a summary for each dataset that includes:
   - **Name of the Dataset**: The official name as mentioned in the paper.
   - **Description**: A brief description of what the dataset contains and its relevance to the research.
   - **Citation**: The full citation for the dataset, formatted according to academic standards.

6. **Cross-Verify Information**: If there are any ambiguities or if the dataset names are not clear, I will cross-reference with other papers or sources cited in the references to ensure accuracy.

7. **Compile the Information**: Finally, I will compile all the extracted information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly documented with its name, description, and citation.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets used in the research paper, providing a comprehensive overview that is useful for future reference.
