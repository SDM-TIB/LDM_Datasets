To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Food Development through Co-creation with AI: bread with a 'taste of love'" by Takuya Sera et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides an overview of the study's focus on AI in food development, but I need to look for specific datasets used in the research.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the collaboration between NEC Corporation and Kimuraya Sohonten Co. for developing "Romance Bread." They mention using AI technologies for ingredient recommendations, but I need to find specific datasets related to the analysis of conversations and song lyrics.

Next, I will examine **section 4 (Romance Bread Development Process)**, particularly the subsections on **Ingredients Recommendation**. Here, the authors describe the process of extracting conversation data and song lyrics to create emotion vectors. They mention extracting **15 hours of conversation data** from a romantic Japanese television program and **about 35,000 songs** from a database of approximately 1 million Japanese song lyrics. These are key datasets that I need to document.

1. **Conversation Data**: This dataset consists of 15 hours of conversation data categorized into five themes related to romance scenes. The specific number of records for each scene is provided, which adds detail to the dataset description.

2. **Song Lyrics Dataset**: This dataset includes approximately 35,000 songs that contain lyrics related to 183 types of food items. This dataset is crucial for understanding the emotional context of the ingredients used in the bread development.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. However, the datasets themselves (conversation data and song lyrics) may not have formal citations as they are derived from proprietary sources or specific analyses conducted by the authors.

For the **conversation data**, I will note that it is derived from a romantic Japanese television program, but since no specific citation is provided, I will describe it as follows:
- **Dataset Name**: Conversation Data from Romantic Japanese Television Program
- **Description**: 15 hours of conversation data categorized into five romance themes.

For the **song lyrics dataset**, I will similarly describe it without a formal citation:
- **Dataset Name**: Japanese Song Lyrics Dataset
- **Description**: Approximately 35,000 songs containing lyrics related to 183 food items.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that captures the essential details, ensuring that I highlight the lack of formal citations for these proprietary datasets.

After completing this process, I will have a clear and organized representation of the datasets used in the study, ready for further processing or review.
