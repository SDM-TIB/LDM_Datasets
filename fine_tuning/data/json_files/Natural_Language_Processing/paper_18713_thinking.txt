To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On the Structural Hardness of Answer Set Programming: Can Structure Efficiently Confine the Power of Disjunctions?" by Markus Hecher and Rafael Kiesel, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract provides a concise overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the work, which may include references to datasets used for experiments or evaluations.

Next, I will examine the **methodology and experiments sections**. These sections typically contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the research. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and any specific characteristics that are relevant to the study.

If the paper includes a **dedicated section on datasets**, I will focus on that section to gather comprehensive information about each dataset. This section may provide details such as the purpose of the dataset, how it was collected, and any preprocessing steps taken.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** of the paper to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. I will ensure that I capture the authors, title, publication venue, and year for each dataset.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, into a structured format. This will ensure clarity and completeness in the documentation of the datasets used in the research.

Finally, I will review the extracted information to confirm its accuracy and completeness before finalizing the dataset entries for any further processing or presentation.
