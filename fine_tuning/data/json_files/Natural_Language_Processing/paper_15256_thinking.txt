To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Diversify Question Generation with Retrieval-Augmented Style Transfer" by Qi Gou et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of external knowledge for question generation, which suggests that datasets may be involved. 

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the potential applications of question generation (QG) and reference existing datasets. I will look for specific mentions of datasets used in their experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly the part where they describe the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they mention using **SQuAD** and **NewsQA** datasets. I will note the details provided about these datasets, including their splits and sizes.

The paper includes a table (Table 1) that summarizes the statistics for the datasets:
- **SQuAD v1.1**: 
  - Train: 86,635
  - Valid: 8,965
  - Test: 8,964
- **SQuAD v2.0**: 
  - Train: 70,484
  - Valid: 10,570
  - Test: 11,877
- **NewsQA**: 
  - Train: 92,549
  - Valid: 5,166
  - Test: 5,126

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **SQuAD**:
  > Pranav Rajpurkar, Jian Zhang, Konstantin Lopyrev, and Percy Liang. *SQuAD: 100,000+ Questions for Machine Comprehension of Text*. In Proceedings of the 2016 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 2383–2392, 2016.

- For **NewsQA**:
  > Steven J. Rennie, Etienne Marcheret, Youssef Mroueh, Jerret Ross, and Vaibhava Goel. *NewsQA: A Machine Comprehension Dataset*. In Proceedings of the 2nd Workshop on Representation Learning for NLP, pages 191–200, 2017.

With this information, I can now compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations as required. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details regarding the datasets used in the research.
