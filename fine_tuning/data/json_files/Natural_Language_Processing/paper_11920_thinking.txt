To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Concept-Based Explanations to Test for False Causal Relationships Learned by Abusive Language Classifiers" by Isar Nejadgholi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to find any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the use of "three well-known abusive language classifiers trained on large English datasets," which suggests that specific datasets will be discussed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** and **methodology sections** to identify any datasets explicitly named or described. The introduction discusses the classifiers and their training on large datasets but does not specify names. However, in the methodology section, the authors mention using the **HateCheck** dataset for building a challenge set, which is a clear indication of a dataset being utilized.

In the **results section**, the authors refer to three classifiers trained on specific datasets: **Jigsaw**, **Civil Comments**, and **TweetEval**. Each of these classifiers is associated with a dataset that I need to document.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to retrieve full citations for each dataset mentioned:

1. **HateCheck**: The citation is:
   > Paul Röttger, Bertie Vidgen, Dong Nguyen, Zeerak Waseem, Helen Margetts, and Janet Pierrehumbert. *HateCheck: Functional tests for hate speech detection models*. In Proceedings of the 59th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics and the 11th International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing, pages 41–58, 2021.

2. **Jigsaw Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Ellery Wulczyn, Nithum Thain, and Lucas Dixon. *Ex machina: Personal attacks seen at scale*. In Proceedings of the 26th International Conference on World Wide Web, pages 1391–1399, 2017.

3. **Civil Comments**: The citation is:
   > David Borkan, Lucas Dixon, Jeffrey Sorensen, Nithum Thain, and Lucy Vasserman. *Nuanced metrics for measuring unintended bias with real data for text classification*. In Companion Proceedings of The 2019 World Wide Web Conference, pages 491–500, 2019.

4. **TweetEval**: The citation is:
   > Francesco Barbieri, Jose Camacho-Collados, Luis Espinosa Anke, and Leonardo Neves. *TweetEval: Unified benchmark and comparative evaluation for tweet classification*. In Findings of the Association for Computational Linguistics: EMNLP 2020, pages 1644–1650, 2020.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and cited according to the requirements. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
