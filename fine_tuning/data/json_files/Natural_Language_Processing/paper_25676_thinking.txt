To extract datasets from the research paper titled "M×T: MAMBA × TRANSFORMER FOR IMAGE INPAINTING" by Shuang Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. In the abstract, the authors state that they evaluate their method on **CelebA-HQ and Places2-standard datasets**, which indicates that these datasets are crucial for their experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors provide more details about the datasets. In section 5 (Experiment Results), they describe the **CelebA-HQ dataset** as consisting of high-quality human face images, specifying that they trained on the first 28,000 images and reserved 2,000 for testing. They also mention the **Places2 dataset**, which comprises a wide range of natural and indoor scene images, detailing that they used the standard training set of 1.8 million images and tested on its validation set of 30,000 images.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **CelebA-HQ dataset**, the citation is:
   > Tero Karras, Timo Aila, Samuli Laine, and Jaakko Lehtinen. *Progressive growing of gans for improved quality, stability, and variation*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1710.10196, 2017.

2. For the **Places2 dataset**, the citation is:
   > Bolei Zhou, Agata Lapedriza, Aditya Khosla, Aude Oliva, and Antonio Torralba. *Places: A 10 million image database for scene recognition*. IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 40(6):1452–1464, 2017.

With this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
