To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Ranking with Popularity Bias: User Welfare under Self-Amplification Dynamics" by Nadav Merlis et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** of the paper. The abstract often provides a concise overview of the research and may mention datasets used for experiments. In this case, the abstract discusses the impact of popularity bias on user welfare but does not explicitly mention any datasets.

Next, I will examine the **introduction section** for any references to datasets. The introduction may provide context or background that includes specific datasets used in the research. However, it appears that this section primarily discusses the theoretical framework without naming any datasets.

I will then look into the **methodology or experiments section**. This section typically details the datasets used for the experiments. I will search for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics. If the paper describes simulations or experiments, it may refer to specific datasets or benchmarks.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention using **synthetic datasets** for their simulations, but they do not provide specific names or citations for these datasets. Instead, they describe the parameters and configurations used in their experiments.

Next, I will check the **references section** to see if there are any citations related to datasets. If the authors refer to any datasets in their references, I will extract those citations. However, in this case, the references primarily consist of literature on popularity bias and contextual bandits, without specific datasets being cited.

Since the paper does not provide explicit datasets with citations, I will summarize the findings as follows:

1. **Synthetic Datasets**: The paper utilizes synthetic datasets for simulation studies, but no specific names or citations are provided.

2. **No External Datasets Cited**: The authors do not reference any external datasets in their experiments or methodology.

In conclusion, while the paper discusses the use of datasets in a general sense, it does not provide specific datasets or citations that can be extracted. Therefore, I will note that the extraction of datasets from this paper is limited to the mention of synthetic datasets without further details or citations.
