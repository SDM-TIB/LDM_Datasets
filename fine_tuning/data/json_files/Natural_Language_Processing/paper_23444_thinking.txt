To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Demonstration Augmentation for Zero-shot In-context Learning" by Yi Su et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a high-level overview, and while it may not name specific datasets, it can hint at their existence. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets used in the research.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly **section 4.2 (Datasets)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, I will look for explicit mentions of datasets, including their names and any relevant details about their structure or purpose.

In this paper, the authors mention two datasets:

1. **MMLU (Hendrycks et al., 2020)**: This dataset is commonly used to evaluate the common sense reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs). It consists of multiple-choice questions covering various subjects.

2. **BBH (Suzgun et al., 2022)**: This dataset is derived from a subset of tasks within the BIG-Bench benchmark and includes tasks where existing LLMs struggle to reach average human-rater performance. The authors focus on the multiple-choice tasks from this dataset.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **MMLU**, the citation is:
  > Dan Hendrycks, Collin Burns, Steven Basart, Andy Zou, Mantas Mazeika, Dawn Song, and Jacob Steinhardt. *Measuring massive multitask language understanding*. In International Conference on Learning Representations, 2020.

- For **BBH**, the citation is:
  > Mirac Suzgun, Nathan Scales, Nathanael Sch√§rli, Sebastian Gehrmann, Yi Tay, Hyung Won Chung, Aakanksha Chowdhery, Quoc V Le, Ed H Chi, Denny Zhou, et al. *Challenging big-bench tasks and whether chain-of-thought can solve them*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2210.09261, 2022.

Now that I have the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
