To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SambaLingo: Teaching Large Language Models New Languages" by Zoltan Csaki et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the study involves scaling experiments across **9 languages** and integrating various multilingual benchmarks, which suggests that multiple datasets are likely involved.

Next, I will examine the **methodology and evaluation sections** to identify specific datasets used in the experiments. In the **evaluation section**, the authors list several benchmarks, including **FLORES-200**, **SIB-200**, **EXAMS**, and others, which indicates that these are datasets utilized for evaluation purposes.

I will then look for detailed descriptions of these datasets in the **results or datasets section** of the paper. The authors mention the following datasets:

1. **FLORES-200**: A multilingual evaluation benchmark for low-resource and multilingual machine translation, which includes 200 languages.
2. **SIB-200**: A dataset for topic classification in over 200 languages and dialects.
3. **EXAMS**: A dataset for cross-lingual and multilingual question answering, specifically designed for high school examinations.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **FLORES-200**, the citation is:
  > Naman Goyal, Cynthia Gao, Vishrav Chaudhary, Peng-Jen Chen, Guillaume Wenzek, Da Ju, Sanjana Krishnan, Marc’Aurelio Ranzato, Francisco Guzmán, and Angela Fan. *The flores-101 evaluation benchmark for low-resource and multilingual machine translation*. 2021.

- For **SIB-200**, the citation is:
  > David Adelani, Hannah Liu, Xiaoyu Shen, Nikita Vassilyev, Jesujoba Alabi, Yanke Mao, Haonan Gao, and En-Shiun Lee. *SIB-200: A simple, inclusive, and big evaluation dataset for topic classification in 200+ languages and dialects*. In Proceedings of the 18th Conference of the European Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers), pp. 226–245, St. Julian’s, Malta, March 2024.

- For **EXAMS**, the citation is:
  > Momchil Hardalov, Todor Mihaylov, Dimitrina Zlatkova, Yoan Dinkov, Ivan Koychev, and Preslav Nakov. *EXAMS: A multi-subject high school examinations dataset for cross-lingual and multilingual question answering*. In Proceedings of the 2020 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), pp. 5427–5444, Online, November 2020.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
