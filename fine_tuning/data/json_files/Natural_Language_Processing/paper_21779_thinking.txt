To extract datasets from the research paper titled "LASER: Tuning-Free LLM-Driven Attention Control for Efficient Text-conditioned Image-to-Animation" by Haoyu Zheng et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the introduction of a "Text-conditioned Image-to-Animation Benchmark," which suggests that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will look closely at **section 4.1 (Text-conditioned Image-to-Animation Benchmark)**, where the authors describe this benchmark in detail. They state that it consists of 100 sets of textual descriptions categorized into various groups, which indicates that this is a dataset specifically created for their experiments.

The paper outlines the categories of the benchmark:
1. **Animal actions and appearance transformations** (20 sets)
2. **Animal appearance and species changes** (20 sets)
3. **Transitions in natural landscapes and objects** (20 sets)
4. **Human figures and alterations in painting styles** (20 sets)
5. **Character identity transformations** (10 sets)
6. **Changes in object colors and materials** (10 sets)

This detailed description confirms that the "Text-conditioned Image-to-Animation Benchmark" is a dataset used for evaluating their proposed method.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for this dataset. However, since this benchmark is newly introduced in this paper, it may not have a separate citation. Instead, I will cite the paper itself as the source of the dataset.

The citation for the dataset is:
> Haoyu Zheng, Juncheng Li, Wenqiao Zhang, Zheqi Lv, Yaoke Wang, Siliang Tang, Hao Zhou, Yueting Zhuang, Jiang Liu. *LASER: Tuning-Free LLM-Driven Attention Control for Efficient Text-conditioned Image-to-Animation*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2403.13447 (2024).

In summary, I have identified one dataset from the paper, which is the "Text-conditioned Image-to-Animation Benchmark," and I have noted its citation. I will now compile this information into a structured format for further processing.
