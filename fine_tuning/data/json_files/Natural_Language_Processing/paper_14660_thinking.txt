To extract datasets from the research paper titled "VLATTACK: Multimodal Adversarial Attacks on Vision-Language Tasks via Pre-trained Models" by Ziyi Yin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the evaluation of their method on various tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved. I will look for specific mentions of datasets in these sections.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the use of large-scale unlabeled image-text datasets for pre-training, which indicates that there are datasets used for training and evaluation. I will note any specific dataset names mentioned.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. I will look for a dedicated section or subsection that lists the datasets, often labeled as "Datasets" or similar. 

Upon reviewing the paper, I find the following datasets mentioned:

1. **VQAv2 Dataset**: This dataset is used for the visual question answering task. It is a well-known dataset in the field of vision-language tasks.

2. **SNLI-VE Dataset**: This dataset is used for the visual entailment task, which is another common dataset in multimodal research.

3. **RefCOCO, RefCOCOg, and RefCOCO+ Datasets**: These datasets are used for referring expression comprehension tasks, which involve localizing objects in images based on textual descriptions.

4. **NLVR2 Dataset**: This dataset is used for visual reasoning tasks, which require understanding relationships between images and text.

5. **MSCOCO Dataset**: This dataset is used for image captioning tasks, providing a large set of images with corresponding captions.

6. **ImageNet-1K Dataset**: This dataset is used for image classification tasks, a standard benchmark in computer vision.

7. **SVHN Dataset**: This dataset is used for digit classification tasks, specifically for recognizing digits in natural images.

Now, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for each of these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries with their full citations for clarity and completeness. This structured approach ensures that I accurately capture all relevant datasets and their citations from the paper.
