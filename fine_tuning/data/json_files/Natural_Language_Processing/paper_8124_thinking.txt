To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "Pretrained Transformers Do not Always Improve Robustness" by Swaroop Mishra et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a general overview, but the experiments section is likely where specific datasets will be detailed.

In **section 2.2 (Datasets)**, the authors explicitly mention two datasets used for their experiments:

1. **SST-2**: This dataset is described as a collection of movie reviews with human annotations, where all samples are classified as either positive or negative.

2. **IMDB**: This dataset consists of highly polarized reviews from the IMDb database, where negative reviews score ≤ 4 and positive reviews score ≥ 7 out of 10, with no neutral reviews included.

Next, I will verify the details of these datasets by checking the **References section** for their full citations:

- For **SST-2**, the citation is:
  > Alex Wang, Amanpreet Singh, Julian Michael, Felix Hill, Omer Levy, and Samuel R. Bowman. *GLUE: A Multi-Task Benchmark and Analysis Platform for Natural Language Understanding*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1804.07461, 2018.

- For **IMDB**, the citation is:
  > Andrew L. Maas, Raymond E. Daly, Peter T. Pham, Dan Huang, Andrew Y. Ng, and Christopher Potts. *Learning Word Vectors for Sentiment Analysis*. In Proceedings of the 49th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, pages 142–150, Portland, Oregon, USA, 2011. Association for Computational Linguistics.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
