To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DART: Depth-Enhanced Accurate and Real-Time Background Matting" by Hanxi Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the development of a new algorithm for background matting that utilizes depth information, which suggests that there may be datasets involved in the evaluation of this method. The introduction will provide context and possibly mention specific datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section**. In this paper, there is a section labeled **E. Proposed Dataset**, where the authors describe their newly created dataset called "JXNU RGBD Background Matting" (JXNU-RGBD). This section provides details about the dataset, including the number of scenes, images, and the labeling process.

The authors state that the JXNU-RGBD dataset contains:
- 12 indoor scenes
- 100 pure background RGB-D images per scene
- 5 RGB-D images with foreground objects for testing
- Only the alpha matte on the test images is manually labeled for evaluation.

This information is crucial for understanding the dataset's structure and purpose.

Next, I will check the **experiments section** to confirm that the JXNU-RGBD dataset was indeed used for evaluating the proposed method. The authors mention that they fine-tuned their model on the JXNU-RGBD dataset, which reinforces its significance in their research.

Finally, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citation for the JXNU-RGBD dataset. However, since this dataset is newly proposed in this paper, it may not have an external citation. Instead, I will note that the dataset is introduced in this paper itself.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the dataset as follows:

- For the **JXNU RGBD Background Matting** dataset, the citation is:
  > Hanxi Li, Guofeng Li, Bo Li, Lin Wu, and Yan Cheng. *DART: Depth-Enhanced Accurate and Real-Time Background Matting*. In Journal of Latex Class Files, vol. 14, no. 8, pp. 1-5, August 2015.

With this information gathered, I will prepare to create the dataset entry in the required format, ensuring that all details are accurately represented for future reference or processing.
