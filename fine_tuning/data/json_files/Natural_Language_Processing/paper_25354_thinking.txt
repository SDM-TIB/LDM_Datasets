To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Imbalanced Graph-Level Anomaly Detection via Counterfactual Augmentation and Feature Learning" by Zitong Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections for any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on public datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will look into **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they provide a summary of eight datasets, including:

1. **AIDS**: A dataset with 2,000 graphs, an average of 15.69 nodes, and 16.2 normal instances.
2. **BZR**: Contains 405 graphs, with an average of 35.75 edges and 327 normal instances.
3. **COX2**: Comprises 467 graphs, averaging 41.22 nodes, with 365 normal instances.
4. **DHFR**: Includes 756 graphs, with an average of 42.43 edges and 473 normal instances.
5. **ENZYMES**: A dataset of 600 graphs, averaging 32.63 nodes, with 160 normal instances.
6. **IMDB-BINARY**: Contains 1,000 graphs, with an average of 19.77 edges and 600 normal instances.
7. **NCI1**: Comprises 4,110 graphs, averaging 29.87 nodes, with 2,464 normal instances.
8. **hERG**: A dataset with 655 graphs, averaging 26.48 edges, and 164 normal instances.

I will also check the **References section** for full citations of these datasets. The authors mention that the datasets are commonly used in graph anomaly detection, and they provide a reference to a benchmark collection of datasets.

The citation for the datasets can be summarized as follows:
- For the datasets mentioned, the citation is:
  > Christopher Morris, Nils M Kriege, Franka Bause, Kristian Kersting, Petra Mutzel, and Marion Neumann. *TUDataset: A collection of benchmark datasets for learning with graphs*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2007.08663, 2020.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations as required.

After completing this process, I will have a structured output that accurately reflects the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
