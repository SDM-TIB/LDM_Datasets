To extract datasets from the research paper titled "FOCUS: Object-Centric World Models for Robotics Manipulation" by Stefano Ferraro et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned or referenced. The abstract discusses the evaluation of the proposed model on manipulation tasks, which suggests that datasets may be involved, but does not specify any names.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section 4) closely, as this is where datasets are typically detailed. In **Section 4.1**, the authors mention testing their approach in two simulation environments: **ManiSkill2** and **robosuite**. I will note these as they are likely the datasets used for evaluation.

In **Section 4.1**, the authors specify that they tested their approach on manipulation tasks using these environments. They mention specific setups within these environments, such as a single red cube, a two-cube setup (red and green), and various YCB objects (banana and master chef can). This indicates that the datasets are related to these specific tasks and objects.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper does not provide explicit citations for the datasets themselves, but it does reference the environments used:

1. **ManiSkill2**: The citation for this benchmark is:
   > Gu, J., Xiang, F., Li, X., Ling, Z., Liu, X., Mu, T., Tang, Y., Tao, S., Wei, X., Yao, Y., Yuan, P., Xie, Z., Huang, R., Chen, H., & Su, H. (2023). *ManiSkill2: A unified benchmark for generalizable manipulation skills*.

2. **robosuite**: The citation for this framework is:
   > Zhu, Y., Wong, J., Mandlekar, A., Martín-Martín, R., Joshi, A., Nasiriany, S., & Zhu, Y. (2020). *robosuite: A modular simulation framework and benchmark for robot learning*. 

Having identified the datasets and their respective citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and future reference.

In summary, the datasets extracted from the paper are:
- **ManiSkill2**: Gu et al. (2023)
- **robosuite**: Zhu et al. (2020)

Now, I will prepare to present this information in the required format for further processing or review.
