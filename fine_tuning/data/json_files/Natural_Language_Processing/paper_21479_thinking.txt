To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Anti-Byzantine Attacks Enabled Vehicle Selection for Asynchronous Federated Learning in Vehicular Edge Computing" by Cui Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will look for any explicit references to datasets used in the experiments or simulations.

Next, I will check the **experiments section** (which may be labeled differently, such as "Simulation Results" or "Results") to find detailed descriptions of the datasets used. In this paper, the authors mention using the **MNIST dataset** as the data source for vehicles and RSUs. This is a clear indication that a dataset is involved.

I will also look for any additional datasets mentioned in the **references section** or throughout the paper that may have been used for comparison or validation purposes. However, in this case, the MNIST dataset appears to be the primary dataset referenced.

Now, I will gather the full citation for the MNIST dataset from the references section. The MNIST dataset is widely known, but I will ensure to provide the correct citation as it is crucial for proper attribution.

The citation for the MNIST dataset is:
> Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998. Available: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

After identifying the dataset and its citation, I will compile this information into a structured format that highlights the dataset's name, description, and citation.

In summary, I will extract the following dataset information:
1. **Dataset Name**: MNIST
2. **Description**: A dataset of handwritten digits used for training various image processing systems.
3. **Citation**: Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998. Available: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

Finally, I will ensure that this information is presented clearly and accurately for any further processing or review.
