To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The Journey to Trustworthy AIâ€“ Part 1: Pursuit of Pragmatic Frameworks" by Mohamad M. Nasr-Azadani and Jean-Luc Chatelain, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections that discuss data and methodologies** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a high-level overview, but I will need to look deeper into the body of the paper for specific dataset references.

Next, I will focus on sections that typically contain dataset information, such as **section 4 (AI Regulation: Current Global Landscape)** and **section 5 (Risk)**. These sections may discuss datasets used for analysis or examples of datasets relevant to the topics of AI regulation and risk management.

In section 4.6, the authors mention the use of various web-crawled datasets for training AI models, specifically referencing the **CommonCrawl**, **C4**, **GitHub**, **Wikipedia**, **Books**, **ArXiv**, and **StackExchange** datasets. Each of these datasets is described in terms of its content and relevance to AI training.

Now, I will compile the full citations for these datasets from the references section of the paper:

1. **CommonCrawl**: 
   > CommonCrawl. *Common Crawl Dataset*. Available at: https://commoncrawl.org/.

2. **C4**: 
   > Raffel, C., Shazeer, N., Roberts, A., Lee, K., Narang, S., Matena, M., Zhou, Y., Li, W., & Liu, P. J. (2020). *Exploring the limits of transfer learning with a unified text-to-text transformer*. Journal of Machine Learning Research, 21(140), 1-67.

3. **GitHub**: 
   > GitHub. *GitHub Dataset*. Available at: https://github.com/.

4. **Wikipedia**: 
   > Wikimedia Foundation. *Wikipedia Statistics*. Available at: https://stats.wikimedia.org/.

5. **Books**: 
   > Books dataset is typically a collection of various literary works, but a specific citation is not provided in the paper.

6. **ArXiv**: 
   > ArXiv. *ArXiv Dataset*. Available at: https://arxiv.org/.

7. **StackExchange**: 
   > Stack Exchange. *Stack Exchange Data Dump*. Available at: https://archive.org/details/stackexchange.

After identifying these datasets and their citations, I will ensure that I accurately represent each dataset's purpose and relevance in the context of the paper's discussion on trustworthy AI.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference and further analysis.
