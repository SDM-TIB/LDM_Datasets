To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Point2Mask: Point-supervised Panoptic Segmentation via Optimal Transport" by Wentong Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on **Pascal VOC** and **COCO**, which suggests these are the datasets used.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of these datasets in the **experiments section**. In section 4.1, the authors explicitly state that they conducted experiments on **Pascal VOC** and **COCO** benchmarks. They provide details about the datasets, such as the number of images and categories, which confirms their use in the study.

In section 4.1, the authors describe:

1. **Pascal VOC**: This dataset consists of 20 "thing" and 1 "stuff" categories, containing 10,582 images for training and 1,449 images for validation.
2. **COCO**: This dataset includes 80 "thing" and 53 "stuff" categories, with 115,000 images for training and 5,000 images for validation.

Now, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Pascal VOC**, the citation is:
  > Mark Everingham, Luc Van Gool, Christopher KI Williams, John Winn, and Andrew Zisserman. *The Pascal Visual Object Classes (VOC) Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 88(2):303–338, 2010.

- For **COCO**, the citation is:
  > Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, Serge Belongie, James Hays, Pietro Perona, Deva Ramanan, Piotr Dollár, and C Lawrence Zitnick. *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. In Proceedings of the European Conference on Computer Vision, pages 740–755, 2014.

With this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
