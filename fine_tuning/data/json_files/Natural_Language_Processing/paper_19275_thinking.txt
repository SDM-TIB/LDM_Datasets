To extract datasets from the research paper titled "From parcels to people: development of a spatially explicit risk indicator to monitor residential pesticide exposure in agricultural areas" by Francesco Galimberti et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's objectives and methods, which may hint at the datasets used.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Materials and Methods)**, particularly the subsection **2.1 (Data)**, where the authors summarize the datasets used in their analysis. Here, they categorize the datasets into three main categories: Pesticides, Agriculture, and Population. This section is likely to contain detailed descriptions of each dataset, including their sources and relevance to the study.

In **Table 1**, the authors list the datasets along with their descriptions and references. I will extract the relevant datasets from this table, ensuring to note down their names and descriptions accurately.

The datasets mentioned include:

1. **Pesticide Sales - BNV-d**: A database containing pesticide sales data in France from 2013 to 2021, based on declarations by registered distributors.
   - Citation: French Government (2023).

2. **Plant Protection Product (PPP) dataset**: Digitalized data on plant protection products, fertilizers, and more from the French government.
   - Citation: Ramalanjaona (2020); Cherrier et al. (2021).

3. **Pesticide Properties DataBase (PPDB)**: A comprehensive database including pesticide chemical identity, physicochemical, human health, and ecotoxicological data.
   - Citation: PPDB (2023).

4. **EU Pesticide Database (EUPDB)**: An EU database with details on approved and non-approved substances used in plant protection products.
   - Citation: European Commission (2023a).

5. **LUCAS Soil Survey**: An extensive and regular topsoil survey carried out across the EU to derive policy-relevant statistics on the effect of land management on soil characteristics.
   - Citation: JRC (2023b).

6. **Gridded Population Data**: Data consisting of gridded information at a 200-meter resolution, including variables related to individualsâ€™ age distribution, household characteristics, and income.
   - Citation: French Government (2016); Insee (2017).

Next, I will ensure that I have the full citations for each dataset as they are crucial for proper referencing. I will compile these citations from the references section of the paper.

Finally, I will summarize the extracted datasets, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This structured approach will help in accurately capturing the datasets used in the research paper for further analysis or reference.
