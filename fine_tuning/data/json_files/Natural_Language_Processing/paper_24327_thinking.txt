To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Cross-Modality Safety Alignment" by Siyin Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract introduces a novel safety alignment challenge called **Safe Inputs but Unsafe Output (SIUO)**, which suggests that a dataset related to this challenge exists.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (The SIUO Benchmark)**, where the authors describe the construction of the SIUO dataset. Here, they mention that the dataset encompasses **nine critical safety domains**, which indicates that this is a primary dataset of interest.

In this section, the authors detail the dataset's structure, including the number of test cases (167) and the average word length (27.2). They also discuss the diversity of the dataset, which covers various safety subclasses, confirming its comprehensive nature.

I will also check the **experiments section** to see if any additional datasets are mentioned or if the SIUO dataset is used in conjunction with other datasets. However, the focus remains on the SIUO dataset as the primary dataset for their experiments.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citation for the SIUO dataset. The authors mention that the data and evaluation code are available on GitHub, which is a crucial detail for citation.

The citation for the SIUO dataset is:
> Wang, S., Ye, X., Cheng, Q., Duan, J., Li, S., Fu, J., Qiu, X., & Huang, X. (2024). *Cross-Modality Safety Alignment: Safe Inputs but Unsafe Output (SIUO) Benchmark*. Available at: https://github.com/sinwang20/SIUO.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry for the SIUO dataset, ensuring to include the full citation as required.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry in the specified format, ready for review or further processing.
