To extract datasets from the research paper titled "LAA-Net: Localized Artifact Attention Network for High-Quality Deepfakes Detection" by Dat Nguyen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that experiments were performed on several benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved. 

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors mention using the **FF++ dataset** for training and validation. They describe it as containing 1000 original videos and 4000 fake videos generated by four different manipulation methods. This is a clear indication of a dataset being used.

I will also check the **experiments section** for any additional datasets mentioned. The authors refer to testing on four datasets: **Celeb-DFv2**, **DeepFake Detection (DFD)**, **DeepFake Detection Challenge (DFDC)**, and **Wild Deepfake (DFW)**. This confirms that multiple datasets are utilized in their experiments.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper from the **References section**:

1. **FF++ Dataset**:
   > Andreas Rössler, Davide Cozzolino, Luisa Verdoliva, Christian Riess, Justus Thies, and Matthias Nießner. *FaceForensics++: Learning to detect manipulated facial images*. In International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2019.

2. **Celeb-DFv2 Dataset**:
   > Yuezun Li, Xin Yang, Pu Sun, Honggang Qi, and Siwei Lyu. *Celeb-DF: A new dataset for deepfake forensics*. CoRR, abs/1909.12962, 2019.

3. **DeepFake Detection Dataset (DFD)**:
   > Nick Dufour and Andrew Gully. *Contributing data to deepfake detection research*. https://ai.googleblog.com/2019/09/contributing-data-to-deepfake-detection.html, 2019.

4. **DeepFake Detection Challenge Dataset (DFDC)**:
   > Brian Dolhansky, Russ Howes, Ben Pflaum, Nicole Baram, and Cristian Canton-Ferrer. *The deepfake detection challenge (DFDC) preview dataset*. CoRR, abs/1910.08854, 2019.

   > Bojia Zi, Minghao Chang, Jingjing Chen, Xingjun Ma, and Yu-Gang Jiang. *Wilddeepfake: A challenging real-world dataset for deepfake detection*. Proceedings of the 28th ACM International Conference on Multimedia, 2020.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and full citation for each dataset. This ensures that all relevant details are captured accurately for further processing or review.
