To extract datasets from the research paper titled "General Point Model Pretraining with Autoencoding and Autoregressive" by Zhe Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the research, which may include references to datasets used for training or evaluation.

Next, I will look for specific sections that typically contain dataset information, such as **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors usually describe their experimental setup, including the datasets utilized. In this paper, I will focus on **subsection 4.1 (Pre-training Data)**, where the authors mention using **ShapeNet** as their pre-training dataset, which consists of over 50,000 unique 3D models across 55 categories. This is a significant dataset for point cloud tasks.

Additionally, I will check **subsection 4.2 (Downstream Tasks)**, where the authors evaluate their model on various datasets. Here, they mention using **ModelNet40** for object classification, which contains 12,311 clean 3D CAD models across 40 categories. They also refer to **ScanObjectNN**, which includes approximately 15,000 objects extracted from real indoor scans, and **ShapeNetPart** for part segmentation tasks.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper from the **References section**:

After collecting this information, I will summarize the datasets and their citations in a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly identified along with its full citation for proper attribution. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
