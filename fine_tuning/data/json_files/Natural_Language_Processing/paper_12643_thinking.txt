To extract datasets from the research paper titled "LimeAttack: Local Explainable Method for Textual Hard-Label Adversarial Attack" by Hai Zhu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their method on "seven common datasets," which indicates that there are multiple datasets to extract. The introduction may provide additional context or specific names of these datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **experiments**. In this paper, the relevant information is likely found in the **"Tasks, Datasets and Models"** section. Here, the authors list the datasets used for their experiments, which include:

1. **MR (Movie Reviews)**: A dataset for sentiment analysis.
2. **SST-2 (Stanford Sentiment Treebank)**: Another sentiment analysis dataset.
3. **AG (AG News)**: A dataset for news categorization.
4. **Yahoo Answers**: A dataset for question-answering tasks.
5. **SNLI (Stanford Natural Language Inference)**: A dataset for textual entailment.
6. **MNLI (Multi-Genre Natural Language Inference)**: A dataset for textual entailment, with matched and mismatched versions.

I will also check the **appendices** for any additional details about the datasets, such as their sizes, classes, or specific characteristics that may be relevant for understanding their use in the experiments.

After identifying the datasets, I will need to find the full citations for each dataset. This information is typically found in the **References section** of the paper. I will look for the original papers or sources that introduced these datasets. 

For example, I will find citations for:
- **MR Dataset**: The citation is:

- **SST-2 Dataset**: The citation is:

- **SNLI Dataset**: The citation is:

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries along with their full citations, ensuring that I have accurately represented each dataset's details as described in the paper.
