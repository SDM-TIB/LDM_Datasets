To extract datasets from the research paper titled "S2MVTC: a Simple yet Efficient Scalable Multi-View Tensor Clustering" by Zhen Long et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the experimental results are based on **six large-scale multi-view datasets**, which indicates that datasets are indeed used.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors provide details about the datasets used. In this section, they list the datasets as follows:

1. **CCV**: Contains 6,773 samples, 20 clusters, and 3 views with features of size 20, 20, and 20.
2. **Caltech102**: Comprises 9,144 samples, 102 clusters, and 6 views with features of size 48, 40, 254, 1984, 512, and 928.
3. **NUS-WIDE-OBJ**: Includes 30,000 samples, 31 clusters, and 5 views with features of size 65, 226, 145, 74, and 129.
4. **AwA**: Contains 30,475 samples, 50 clusters, and 6 views with features of size 2688, 2000, 252, 2000, 2000, and 2000.
5. **Cifar-10**: Comprises 50,000 samples, 10 clusters, and 3 views with features of size 512, 2048, and 1024.
6. **YoutubeFace sel**: Includes 101,499 samples, 31 clusters, and 5 views with features of size 64, 512, 64, 647, and 838.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The paper does not provide explicit citations for each dataset, but I can look up the datasets individually to provide accurate references:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations to ensure completeness and accuracy. This structured approach will help in effectively extracting and documenting the datasets used in the research paper.
