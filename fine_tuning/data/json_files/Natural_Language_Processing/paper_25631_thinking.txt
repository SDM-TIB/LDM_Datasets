To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The Collection of a Human Robot Collaboration Dataset for Cooperative Assembly in Glovebox Environments" by Shivansh Sharma et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract introduces the **HAGS: Hand and Glove Segmentation Dataset**, which is a strong indicator that this is a primary dataset of interest.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (HAGS Dataset)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the dataset. They mention that the HAGS dataset consists of 191 videos totaling approximately 9 hours of footage, with 1,728 annotated frames. This section outlines the dataset's purpose, collection methods, and the specific tasks involved, confirming its significance.

In the **experiments section**, the authors reference the HAGS dataset multiple times, indicating its use in their experiments. This reinforces that the dataset is central to their research.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citation for the HAGS dataset. The authors provide a specific citation for it:

- For the **HAGS Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Shivansh Sharma, Mathew Huang, Sanat Nair, Alan Wen, Christina Petlowany, Selma Wanna, and Mitch Pryor. *Hand and Glove Segmentation Dataset for Department of Energy Glovebox Environments*. 2024. Available at https://doi.org/10.18738/T8/85R7KQ.

Additionally, I will check for any other datasets mentioned in the paper. The authors reference several other datasets in their comparisons, such as **WorkingHands**, **HaDR**, and **HRC**. I will extract their citations as well:

- For **WorkingHands**, the citation is:
  > Roy Shilkrot, Supreeth Narasimhaswamy, Saif Vazir, and Minh Hoai. *Workinghands: A hand-tool assembly dataset for image segmentation and activity mining*. In British Machine Vision Conference, 2019.

- For **HaDR**, the citation is:
  > Stefan Grushko, Aleš Vysocký, Jakub Chlebek, and Petr Prokop. *HaDR: Applying Domain Randomization for Generating Synthetic Multimodal Dataset for Hand Instance Segmentation in Cluttered Industrial Environments*. 2023.

- For **HRC**, the citation is:
  > Seyedomid Sajedi, Wansong Liu, Kareem Eltouny, Sara Behdad, Minghui Zheng, and Xiao Liang. *Uncertainty-Assisted Image-Processing for Human-Robot Close Collaboration*. IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters, 7(2):4236–4243, 2022.

After gathering all relevant dataset information and citations, I will compile this into a structured format for further use or analysis. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations as presented in the paper.
