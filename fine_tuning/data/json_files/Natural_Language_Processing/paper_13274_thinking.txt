To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On Using Admissible Bounds for Learning Forward Search Heuristics" by Carlos Núñez-Molina et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental evaluation sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, while the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

Next, I will pay particular attention to **section 4 (Experimental Evaluation)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. This section often contains detailed information about the datasets, including their characteristics, sizes, and how they were generated or collected.

In this paper, the authors mention that they conducted experiments on four classical planning domains: **blocksworld, ferry, gripper, and visitall**. I will look for specific details about these datasets, such as the number of instances generated for training, validation, and testing, as well as any parameters used in their generation.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations related to the datasets or any foundational works that describe them. This is crucial for providing proper attribution and context for the datasets used in the research.

For example, the paper mentions the use of PDDL domains for generating problem instances. I will need to find the original sources or relevant papers that describe these PDDL domains to provide accurate citations.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I capture all relevant details and provide proper credit to the original sources of the datasets used in the research.
