To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Decentralized Coordination of Distributed Energy Resources through Local Energy Markets and Deep Reinforcement Learning" by Daniel C. Maya et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the use of an **open-source dataset** for evaluating the performance of deep reinforcement learning agents, which indicates that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **methodology section**. In this section, the authors state that they trained their agents on the **CityLearn2022 dataset**. This is a clear indication of the dataset being used, and I will need to gather more details about it.

In the **experimental design subsection**, the authors provide additional context about the CityLearn2022 dataset, noting that it includes a year of hourly data for 17 smart community buildings, featuring time series of energy demand, photovoltaic generation, and battery energy storage system (BESS) performance characteristics. This information is crucial for describing the dataset.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the CityLearn2022 dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:
> K. Nweye, S. Siva, G. Z. Nagy. *The CityLearn Challenge 2022*. 2023. doi:10.18738/T8/0YLJ6Q. URL: https://doi.org/10.18738/T8/0YLJ6Q.

With this information, I can now summarize the dataset details:

1. **CityLearn2022 Dataset**: This dataset provides a year of hourly data for 17 smart community buildings, including time series of energy demand, photovoltaic generation, and BESS performance characteristics.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry with the full citation into a structured format for further processing.
