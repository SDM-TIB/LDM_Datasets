To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Error Analysis of Generative Adversarial Network" by Mahmud Hasan and Hailin Sang, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, and the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the datasets used.

Next, I will look for specific sections that typically contain dataset information, such as **"Datasets," "Experiments," or "Methodology."** These sections usually provide detailed descriptions of the datasets, including their names, sizes, and any relevant characteristics.

As I read through these sections, I will take note of any datasets mentioned. If the authors refer to datasets without providing full names, I will look for context clues or references to previous works that might provide the full names or details of those datasets.

Once I identify the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial, as proper citation is necessary for academic integrity and for readers who may want to access the datasets themselves.

For example, if the authors mention using the **MNIST dataset** for training, I would look for the citation in the references, which might be something like:
> Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998.

If the paper discusses multiple datasets, I will repeat this process for each one, ensuring that I capture all relevant details and citations.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, into a structured format that can be easily reviewed or processed further. This will ensure that all extracted information is organized and accessible for future reference or analysis.
