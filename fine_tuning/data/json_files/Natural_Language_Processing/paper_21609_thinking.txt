To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Reliable Empirical Machine Unlearning Evaluation" by Yiwen Tu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of unlearning algorithms, but it does not specify any datasets. The introduction may provide more context or mention specific datasets used in their experiments.

Next, I will examine the **methodology** section, particularly the parts that describe the experimental setup. This section often contains detailed information about the datasets used for training and testing the models. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names and characteristics.

In the **experiments** section, the authors typically describe the datasets used for empirical validation. I will pay close attention to any tables or figures that summarize the datasets, as they often provide concise information about the dataset sizes, types, and any relevant splits (e.g., training, validation, test).

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references** section to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets.

Based on the content of the paper, I will compile the following datasets:

1. **CIFAR10 Dataset**: This dataset is mentioned in the experiments section as the primary dataset used for image classification tasks. The authors describe its characteristics and how it is utilized in their experiments.

The full citation for the CIFAR10 dataset is:
> Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton, et al. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. University of Toronto, 2009.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will summarize the datasets and their citations in a structured format for clarity and ease of use in future references or analyses.
