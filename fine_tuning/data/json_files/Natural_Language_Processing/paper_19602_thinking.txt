To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Value Preferences Estimation and Disambiguation in Hybrid Participatory Systems" by Enrico Liscio et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections for any references to datasets. The abstract mentions evaluating methods on a dataset from a large-scale survey on energy transition, which indicates that a dataset is indeed present.

Next, I will look for specific sections that typically contain dataset information, such as **section 3 (Background)** and **section 5 (Experimental Setting)**. In section 3.1, the authors describe the Participatory Value Evaluation (PVE) conducted between April and May 2020, which involved 1,376 participants and aimed to support energy policy decisions. This is a clear indication of a dataset being utilized.

In section 3.1, the authors provide details about the survey, including the question posed to participants and the structure of the data collected (choices and motivations). They also mention that 876 participants provided at least one motivation, resulting in a total of 3,229 motivations. This information is crucial for understanding the dataset's context.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset mentioned. The authors refer to the dataset as the "PVE conducted by Spruit & Mouter (2020)." Therefore, I will look up this reference to provide the complete citation.

The citation for the dataset is:
> Spruit, S. L., & Mouter, N. (2020). 1376 residents of Súdwest-Fryslân about the future energy policy of their municipality: the results of a consultation.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and full citation.

1. **Dataset Name**: Participatory Value Evaluation (PVE)
   - **Description**: A dataset from a large-scale survey conducted between April and May 2020 involving 1,376 participants, aimed at supporting energy policy decisions in Súdwest-Fryslân, Netherlands. The dataset includes choices and motivations provided by participants regarding energy policy options.
   - **Citation**: Spruit, S. L., & Mouter, N. (2020). 1376 residents of Súdwest-Fryslân about the future energy policy of their municipality: the results of a consultation.

After gathering all this information, I will ensure that it is presented clearly and accurately for any further processing or review.
