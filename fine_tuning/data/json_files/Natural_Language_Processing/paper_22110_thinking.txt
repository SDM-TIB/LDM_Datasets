To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Revenge of the Fallen? Recurrent Models Match Transformers at Predicting Human Language Comprehension Metrics" by James A. Michaelov et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study compares the performance of different language models on various human language comprehension datasets, which suggests that multiple datasets will be discussed.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, specifically **section 3.2 (Datasets)**, where the authors provide a detailed list of the datasets used in their analysis. Here, they mention that they are using **9 human language comprehension datasets** covering different metrics. The datasets are categorized into two groups: **N400 datasets** and **reading time datasets**.

The paper lists the following datasets:

1. **N400 Datasets**:
   - **Federmeier et al. (2007)**: This dataset includes 564 stimuli and 7,856 trials.
   - **Hubbard et al. (2019)**: This dataset consists of 192 stimuli and 5,705 trials.
   - **Michaelov et al. (2024)**: This dataset has 500 stimuli and 5,526 trials.
   - **Szewczyk & Federmeier (2022)**: This dataset contains 600 stimuli and 4,822 trials.
   - **Szewczyk et al. (2022)**: This dataset includes 672 stimuli and 4,939 trials.
   - **Wlotko & Federmeier (2012)**: This dataset has 300 stimuli and 4,440 trials.

2. **Reading Time Datasets**:
   - **Boyce & Levy (2023)**: This dataset is based on the Maze task with 10,245 stimuli and 56,447 trials.
   - **Brothers & Kuperberg (2021)**: This dataset includes 648 stimuli and 46,092 trials.
   - **Luke & Christianson (2018)**: This dataset consists of 2,689 stimuli and 106,712 trials.

Now, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries along with their full citations for further processing.
