To extract datasets from the research paper titled "TrainerAgent: Customizable and Efficient Model Training through LLM-Powered Multi-Agent System" by Haoyuan Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, experiments, and conclusion sections** to gather initial insights about any datasets referenced. The abstract discusses the TrainerAgent system's capabilities but does not explicitly mention datasets. However, the introduction hints at the use of datasets for training AI models.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as it is likely to contain specific references to datasets used in the evaluations. In this section, the authors mention conducting experiments on real-world business scenarios from Taobao, specifically in computer vision and natural language processing domains. They refer to tasks like Visual Grounding, Image Generation, and Text Classification, which may imply the use of specific datasets.

Upon further examination, I find that the authors mention the **Product Grounding dataset** in the context of the Visual Grounding task. This dataset is crucial for understanding how the TrainerAgent system operates in a practical scenario.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the Product Grounding dataset. The citation is as follows:

- For the **Product Grounding dataset**, the citation is:
  > Haoyuan Li, Hao Jiang, Tao Jin, Mengyan Li, Yan Chen, Zhijie Lin, Yang Zhao, and Zhou Zhao. *Date: Domain adaptive product seeker for e-commerce*. In CVPR, pages 19315â€“19324, 2023.

Additionally, I will check if there are any other datasets mentioned in the context of the experiments or methodology. The paper does not provide explicit names for other datasets used in the experiments, but it does reference the use of internal databases for data collection.

Since the focus is on the Product Grounding dataset, I will document this dataset with its full citation.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format for clarity and future reference.
