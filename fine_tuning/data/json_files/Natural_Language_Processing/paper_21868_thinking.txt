To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Killkan: The Automatic Speech Recognition Dataset for Kichwa with Morphosyntactic Information" by Chihiro Taguchi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant details, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract states that the paper presents "Killkan," the first dataset for automatic speech recognition in the Kichwa language, which indicates that this is the primary dataset discussed.

Next, I will examine **section 4 (Dataset)**, which is likely to contain detailed information about the dataset. In this section, the authors describe the Killkan dataset, including its contents, structure, and the source of the audio data. They mention that the dataset consists of approximately 4 hours of audio, transcription, translation into Spanish, and morphosyntactic annotation.

I will also look for any references to other datasets or related works in the **related work** section, but it appears that the focus is primarily on the Killkan dataset as a novel contribution.

In the **experiments section**, the authors discuss the application of the Killkan dataset in training automatic speech recognition models, further confirming its significance.

Now, I will gather the full citation for the Killkan dataset. Since the dataset is introduced in the paper itself, I will cite it as follows:

- For the **Killkan dataset**, the citation is:
  > Chihiro Taguchi, Jefferson Saransig, Dayana Vel√°squez, and David Chiang. *Killkan: The Automatic Speech Recognition Dataset for Kichwa with Morphosyntactic Information*. In Proceedings of the [Conference Name], [pages], [year]. [Publisher].

I will need to fill in the specific conference name, page numbers, and year based on the actual publication details, which are typically found in the references section or at the beginning of the paper.

After compiling this information, I will ensure that I have accurately captured the dataset's details and citation, ready for any further processing or documentation needs. This structured approach will help maintain clarity and thoroughness in the dataset extraction process.
