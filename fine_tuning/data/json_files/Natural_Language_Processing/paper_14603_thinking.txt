To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Personalized Transformer-based Ranking for e-Commerce at Yandex" by Kirill Khrylchenko and Alexander Fritzler, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the deployment of a model at Yandex, but it does not specify datasets. The introduction provides context about e-commerce platforms and mentions various companies but does not name specific datasets.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe their dataset collection process. Here, they mention gathering one year of logs from Yandex Market, which includes user interactions such as clicks, add-to-cart actions, add-to-favorites, purchases, and web queries. However, they note that due to the proprietary nature of the data, they do not disclose dataset sizes.

In this section, they also describe how they form pre-training samples from user history and how they utilize impressions for fine-tuning. While the dataset is not publicly available, it is crucial to note that it is derived from real user interactions on the Yandex e-commerce platform.

Since the paper does not provide specific names or citations for publicly available datasets, I will not be able to extract traditional dataset citations. However, I will document the dataset as described in the paper.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring to include the details about the dataset as described in the paper, even though it lacks a formal citation.

The dataset entry will include:
- **Name**: Yandex Market User Interaction Logs
- **Description**: A proprietary dataset containing one year of logs from Yandex Market, including user interactions such as clicks, add-to-cart actions, add-to-favorites, purchases, and web queries. The dataset is used for training and fine-tuning a personalized ranking model.
- **Citation**: Not applicable due to proprietary nature.

After gathering this information, I will prepare it for structured output, ensuring clarity and completeness in the dataset description.
