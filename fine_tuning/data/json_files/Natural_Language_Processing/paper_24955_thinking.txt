To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CrowdMoGen: Zero-Shot Text-Driven Collective Motion Generation" by Xinying Guo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the need for crowd datasets, indicating that datasets are likely discussed in detail later in the paper.

In the **introduction**, the authors highlight the challenges in crowd motion generation and mention the scarcity of crowd datasets with paired data. This suggests that they may refer to specific datasets used in their research.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention two datasets:

1. **HumanML3D Dataset**: This dataset is a reannotated combination of the HumanAct12 and AMASS datasets, comprising 14,616 motions and 44,970 textual descriptions.

2. **KIT Motion Language Dataset**: This dataset includes 3,911 motions accompanied by 6,363 natural language descriptions.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **HumanML3D Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Chuan Guo, Shihao Zou, Xinxin Zuo, Sen Wang, Wei Ji, Xingyu Li, and Li Cheng. *Generating diverse and natural 3D human motions from text*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 5152–5161, 2022.

- For the **KIT Motion Language Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Matthias Plappert, Christian Mandery, and Tamim Asfour. *The KIT Motion-Language Dataset*. Big Data, 4(4):236–252, 2016.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations.
