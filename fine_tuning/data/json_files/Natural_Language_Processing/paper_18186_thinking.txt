To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Decentralizing Coordination in Open Vehicle Fleets for Scalable and Dynamic Task Allocation" by Marin Lujak et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract and introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned or referenced. The abstract discusses challenges in coordination and task allocation in vehicle fleets, but does not explicitly mention any datasets.

Next, I will examine the **methodology and experiments sections** of the paper, as these sections often contain details about the datasets used for validation or testing. I will look for any specific names of datasets or references to existing datasets that the authors might have utilized.

In the **experiments section**, if the authors describe their experimental setup, I will pay close attention to any datasets they mention. For instance, they might refer to datasets used for simulations or real-world data collected for their studies.

After identifying any datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

If the paper mentions datasets such as "Open Vehicle Fleet Dataset" or "Dynamic Task Allocation Dataset," I will look for their corresponding citations. For example, if the authors refer to a dataset created by another researcher, I will ensure to include that citation in the format used in the references section.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each entry is clear and accurately reflects the information provided in the paper.

Finally, I will organize this information in a structured format that can be easily reviewed or processed further, ensuring that all citations are complete and correctly formatted.
