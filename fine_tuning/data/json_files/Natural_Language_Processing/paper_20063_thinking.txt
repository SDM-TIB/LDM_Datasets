To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Expressive and Generalizable Motion Features for Face Forgery Detection" by Jingyi Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the research focus and any datasets that may be referenced. In the abstract, the authors mention that their method achieves promising results on three popular face forgery datasets, indicating that specific datasets will be discussed later in the paper.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** to find detailed information about the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, the authors explicitly mention the datasets they utilized for their experiments. I will pay close attention to any tables or figures that summarize the datasets and their characteristics.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention three datasets:

1. **FaceForensics++**: This dataset is described as containing 1000 original real videos from YouTube, with each real video corresponding to four forgery methods. It is widely used for face forgery detection.

2. **DeeperForensics-V1.0**: This dataset contains the same 1000 original videos as FaceForensics++, but it uses a new face generation method based on auto-encoders for face swaps and provides several data distortion versions.

3. **Celeb-DF**: This dataset consists of 540 real videos collected from YouTube and 5639 fake videos, which are more challenging to distinguish than the fake faces in the previous datasets.

Next, I will consult the **References section** to retrieve the full citations for these datasets:

- For **FaceForensics++**, the citation is:
  > Andreas Rossler, Davide Cozzolino, Luisa Verdoliva, Christian Riess, Justus Thies, and Matthias Nießner. "Faceforensics++: Learning to detect manipulated facial images," in ICCV, 2019, pp. 1–11.

- For **DeeperForensics-V1.0**, the citation is:
  > Liming Jiang, Ren Li, Wayne Wu, Chen Qian, and Chen Change Loy. "Deeperforensics-1.0: A large-scale dataset for real-world face forgery detection," in CVPR, 2020, pp. 2889–2898.

- For **Celeb-DF**, the citation is:
  > Yuezun Li, Xin Yang, Pu Sun, Honggang Qi, and Siwei Lyu. "Celeb-df: A large-scale challenging dataset for deepfake forensics," in CVPR, 2020, pp. 3207–3216.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their full citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
