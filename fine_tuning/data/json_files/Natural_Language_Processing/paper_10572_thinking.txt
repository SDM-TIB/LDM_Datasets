To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The COT COLLECTION: Improving Zero-shot and Few-shot Learning of Language Models via Chain-of-Thought Fine-Tuning" by Seungone Kim et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the introduction of a new instruction-tuning dataset called the **COT COLLECTION**, which is a significant dataset for the study.

Next, I will look for specific details about the **COT COLLECTION** in the **methodology section**. The authors describe it as containing **1.84 million rationales across 1,060 tasks**, which indicates its scale and purpose. This dataset is derived from augmenting the existing **Flan Collection**.

In the **experiments section**, the authors mention using the **COT COLLECTION** for fine-tuning models like Flan-T5, which further confirms its role in the research. They also reference several other datasets used for evaluation, specifically in the context of few-shot learning tasks.

I will also check the **related works and references sections** to find citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper references several datasets, including:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as they are crucial for proper attribution and further research.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for easy reference and potential downstream processing.
