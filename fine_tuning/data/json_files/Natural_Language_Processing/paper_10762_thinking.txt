To extract datasets from the research paper titled "TOAST: Transfer Learning via Attention Steering" by Baifeng Shi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that TOAST achieves state-of-the-art results on various transfer learning benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors discuss the datasets used for pre-tuning and evaluation. In this section, they mention:

1. **ImageNet**: Used for pre-tuning the top-down attention module for vision models. This dataset is a well-known large-scale image classification dataset.

2. **OpenWebText**: A subset of this dataset is used for pre-tuning language models. OpenWebText is a dataset created to mimic the content of web pages linked to by Reddit.

3. **FGVC**: The authors evaluate TOAST on fine-grained visual classification tasks, which includes five datasets, each with around 10,000 training images.

4. **VTAB-1k**: This benchmark consists of 18 classification tasks, each containing 1,000 training images, used to evaluate the model's performance across various tasks.

5. **Alpaca Dataset**: This dataset contains 52,000 instruction-following examples used for evaluating language generation.

6. **ShareGPT Dataset**: An open-source dataset collected from ShareGPT conversations, used for comparison with Vicuna.

Now, I will check the **References section** to gather full citations for these datasets:

- For **ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, and Li Fei-Fei. *Imagenet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In 2009 IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pages 248â€“255. IEEE, 2009.

- For **OpenWebText**, the citation is:
  > Aaron Gokaslan and Vanya Cohen. *Openwebtext corpus*. http://Skylion007.github.io/OpenWebTextCorpus, 2019.

- For **FGVC**, the citation is:
  > The FGVC dataset is not attributed to a single paper but is a collection of datasets used for fine-grained visual classification tasks.

- For **VTAB-1k**, the citation is:
  > Xiaohua Zhai, Joan Puigcerver, Alexander Kolesnikov, Pierre Ruyssen, Carlos Riquelme, Mario Lucic, Josip Djolonga, Andre Susano Pinto, Maxim Neumann, Alexey Dosovitskiy, et al. *A large-scale study of representation learning with the visual task adaptation benchmark*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1910.04867, 2019.

- For **Alpaca Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Rohan Taori, Ishaan Gulrajani, Tianyi Zhang, Yann Dubois, Xuechen Li, Carlos Guestrin, Percy Liang, and Tatsunori B. Hashimoto. *Stanford alpaca: An instruction-following llama model*. https://github.com/tatsu-lab/stanford_alpaca, 2023.

- For **ShareGPT Dataset**, the citation is:
  > The dataset is referenced as collected from ShareGPT conversations, but no formal citation is provided in the paper.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes its full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details or citations.
