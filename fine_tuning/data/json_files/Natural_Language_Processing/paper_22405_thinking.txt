To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Lessons from the Use of Natural Language Inference (NLI) in Requirements Engineering Tasks" by Mohamad Fazelnia et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors share lessons learned and characterize the learning settings that make NLI suitable for automating requirements engineering tasks. This suggests that there may be datasets involved, particularly related to requirements engineering.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **methodology and experimentation sections**. In the methodology, the authors describe their approach to requirements analysis and mention that they conducted benchmark studies using various models. This indicates that they likely used specific datasets for their experiments.

In the **experimentation section**, the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their tasks. They state that they created two new datasets: one for software requirements specification defects and another for conflicts in requirements specifications. This is a crucial finding, as it indicates the presence of original datasets developed by the authors.

Now, I will look for detailed descriptions of these datasets in the text. The authors provide information about the sources of their datasets, including:

1. **Requirements Specification Defects Dataset**: This dataset was created using real software requirements documents and student projects, and it includes various classes of defects such as ambiguous, directive, non-measurable, optional, and uncertain requirements.

2. **Conflicts in Requirements Specifications Dataset**: This dataset was constructed by combining several unique datasets from different sources, including public conflict datasets and synthesized conflicting requirements developed by subject matter experts.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. The authors refer to the Promise dataset, which is widely used in requirements engineering research. The citation for the Promise dataset is:

- **Promise Dataset**: 
  > J. Sayyad Shirabad and T. Menzies. *The PROMISE Repository of Software Engineering Databases*. School of Information Technology and Engineering, University of Ottawa, Canada, 2005. Available online: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1m4WsqYmyQvYxxzzxwjOcMBaak26jBndN/view.

Additionally, I will note that the authors have released their two new datasets publicly for the requirements engineering community, which is significant for future research.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper, along with their sources.
