To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A survey of synthetic data augmentation methods in computer vision" by Alhassan Mumuni et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections that discuss datasets** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a general overview of the paper's focus on synthetic data augmentation methods, but it does not explicitly mention datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the body of the paper.

Next, I will examine **section 8 (Synthetic datasets)**, as this section is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets discussed in the paper. Here, the authors summarize several synthetic datasets, including their synthesis methods, domains, supported tasks, and dataset sizes. 

The datasets mentioned in this section include:

1. **RTMV**: A dataset for general scene understanding, synthesized using neural rendering, supporting tasks like view synthesis and pose estimation. The dataset size is not specified.

2. **MPI-Sintel**: A 3D animation dataset used for spatio-temporal scene understanding and optical flow tasks, consisting of 1,628 images.

3. **Objectron**: A dataset containing 3D data from an augmented reality library, supporting multi-view object recognition and 3D object detection, with a size of 4 million images.

4. **Synthia**: A dataset generated using a 3D game engine for autonomous driving tasks, including depth estimation and scene segmentation, with 300,000 images.

5. **LCrowd**: A dataset for crowd analysis, supporting tasks like crowd counting and person detection in crowds, containing 20 million images.

6. **Semantic3D**: A point cloud dataset from laser scanners for urban scene understanding, used for semantic segmentation.

7. **Synscapes**: A dataset synthesized using neural rendering for autonomous driving tasks, supporting pose estimation and depth estimation.

8. **ShapeNet**: A 3D CAD dataset for general recognition and 3D perception.

9. **ScanNet**: A dataset created from RGB-D captures for indoor scene understanding.

10. **Virtual Kitti**: A dataset generated using a 3D game engine for urban scene understanding, supporting various tasks including semantic segmentation.

11. **Pix3D**: A dataset combining 3D scanning and web sources for object shape retrieval and viewpoint estimation.

12. **GTA-V**: A dataset generated from video game play for autonomous driving tasks, including semantic segmentation.

13. **Hypersim**: A dataset synthesized using 3D CAD for indoor scene understanding.

14. **PreSIL**: A dataset generated from video game play for 3D scene understanding.

15. **SOMASet**: A dataset created using 3D CAD for person re-identification and object recognition.

16. **SceneNet-RGBD**: A dataset of RGB-D rendered objects from CAD models for indoor scene understanding.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the references section of the paper. This is crucial for ensuring that each dataset is properly attributed.

For example, the citation for **RTMV** is:
> Tremblay, J., Meshry, M., Evans, A., Kautz, J., Keller, A., Khamis, S., Loop, C., Morrical, N., Nagano, K., Takikawa, T. (2022). "RTMV: A ray-traced multi-view synthetic dataset for novel view synthesis." arXiv preprint arXiv:2205.07058.

I will repeat this process for each dataset mentioned in section 8, ensuring that I capture the correct citation format as presented in the references section.

Finally, I will compile all the dataset entries, including their descriptions and citations, into a structured format for easy reference and further analysis.
