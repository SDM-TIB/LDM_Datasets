To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fast View Synthesis of Casual Videos" by Yao-Chih Lee et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections for any mentions of datasets. In the abstract, the authors refer to their experiments being conducted on the **NVIDIA Dataset** and the **DAVIS Dataset**. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for their research.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (Section 4) to gather more details about these datasets. In Section 4.1, the authors explicitly mention the **NVIDIA Dataset**, describing it as containing 9 scenes captured by 12 cameras, and the **DAVIS Dataset**, which is used to validate their algorithm in real-world scenarios. This confirms that both datasets are utilized in their experiments.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are essential for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access these datasets.

For the **NVIDIA Dataset**, the citation is:
> Jae Shin Yoon, Kihwan Kim, Orazio Gallo, Hyun Soo Park, and Jan Kautz. *Novel view synthesis of dynamic scenes with globally coherent depths from a monocular camera*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2020.

For the **DAVIS Dataset**, the citation is:
> F. Perazzi, J. Pont-Tuset, B. McWilliams, L. Van Gool, M. Gross, and A. Sorkine-Hornung. *A benchmark dataset and evaluation methodology for video object segmentation*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2016.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This will ensure that all relevant details are captured accurately and can be easily referenced in future work.
