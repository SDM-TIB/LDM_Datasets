To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Enhancing ESG Impact Type Identification through Early Fusion and Multilingual Models" by Hariram Veeramani et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and dataset sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, while the introduction discusses the significance of ESG impact type identification, which may hint at the datasets used.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Task Description)**, specifically **subsection 2.2 (Dataset)**, where the authors describe the dataset used for the ML-ESG-2 shared task. Here, they mention that the dataset was curated by Kannan and Seki (2023) and is based on Japanese annual securities reports. This indicates that there is a specific dataset being utilized for the ESG impact type identification task.

The authors detail that the dataset categorizes textual data into three labels: "Opportunity," "Risk," and "Cannot Distinguish," which is crucial for understanding the dataset's structure and purpose.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset mentioned. The citation for the dataset curated by Kannan and Seki is as follows:

- For the dataset curated by Kannan and Seki:
  > Naoki Kannan and Yohei Seki. *Textual evidence extraction for ESG scores*. In Proceedings of the Fifth Workshop on Financial Technology and Natural Language Processing and the Second Multimodal AI For Financial Forecasting, pages 45â€“54, Macao, 2023.

Since this is the only dataset explicitly mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that the full citation is included.

After gathering all the necessary details, I will prepare the dataset entry for review or further processing.
