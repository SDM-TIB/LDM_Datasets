To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Machine Translation with Large Language Models: Prompt Engineering for Persian, English, and Russian Directions" by Nooshin Pourkamali and Shler Ebrahim Sharifi, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and the introduction typically outlines the context and significance of the research, which may include references to datasets.

In the **experimental setup section**, specifically **section 2.1 (Data Sets)**, the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their evaluation. They describe three literary works that serve as the basis for their multilingual translation experiments:

1. **"My Uncle Napoleon"** by Iraj Pezeshkzad for the Persian language.
2. **"The Beggar Boy at Christ’s Christmas Tree"** by Fyodor Dostoyevsky for the Russian language.
3. **"The Tell-Tale Heart"** by Edgar Allan Poe for the English language.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these works. This is crucial for proper attribution and to ensure that the datasets are correctly referenced in any subsequent analysis or reporting.

The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **"My Uncle Napoleon"**:
  > Pezeshkzad, Iraj. *My Uncle Napoleon*. [Publisher information if available].

- For **"The Beggar Boy at Christ’s Christmas Tree"**:
  > Dostoyevsky, Fyodor. *The Beggar Boy at Christ’s Christmas Tree*. [Publisher information if available].

- For **"The Tell-Tale Heart"**:
  > Poe, Edgar Allan. *The Tell-Tale Heart*. [Publisher information if available].

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and that the full citations are included. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the study, which can be useful for future research or replication of the experiments.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring clarity and completeness for any downstream processing or review.
