To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Synthetic Oversampling: Theory and A Practical Approach Using LLMs to Address Data Imbalance" by Ryumei Nakada et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

1. **Read the Abstract and Introduction**: I will start by examining the abstract and introduction sections to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract discusses the introduction of OPAL, a method for generating synthetic data, which may imply the use of specific datasets for validation.

2. **Identify Sections on Datasets**: Next, I will look for sections specifically dedicated to datasets, such as "Datasets," "Experiments," or "Methodology." These sections typically provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the study.

3. **Locate Dataset Descriptions**: In the relevant sections, I will look for explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, characteristics, and any specific details about how they were used in the experiments. For example, the paper mentions using datasets like Diabetes, HeartFailure, and Gender for numerical experiments.

4. **Extract Dataset Information**: For each identified dataset, I will extract the following information:
   - **Name of the Dataset**: The official name as mentioned in the paper.
   - **Description**: A brief description of the dataset, including its purpose and any relevant statistics (e.g., number of samples, features).
   - **Source**: The original source or publication where the dataset can be found.

5. **Consult the References Section**: After gathering the dataset information, I will check the references section of the paper for full citations of the datasets. This is crucial for proper attribution and allows others to locate the datasets easily.

6. **Compile the Dataset Citations**: I will compile the full citations for each dataset, ensuring they are formatted correctly according to the citation style used in the paper.

7. **Final Review**: Finally, I will review the extracted information to ensure accuracy and completeness before presenting it in the required format.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets used in the research paper, including their full citations.
