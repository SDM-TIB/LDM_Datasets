To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Is a 15-minute City within Reach in the United States? An Investigation of Activity-Based Mobility Flows in the 12 Most Populous US Cities" by Tanhua Jin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors used **SafeGraph Point of Interest (POI) check-in data** to evaluate the 15-minute city concept, which suggests that this dataset is crucial for their analysis.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Data and Methodology)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the datasets used. They mention that the POI check-in data was collected from SafeGraph, covering approximately 19 million smartphone devices across all 50 states and the District of Columbia. This dataset is essential for understanding mobility flows in the context of the 15-minute city.

In this section, the authors also describe the socio-demographic data sourced from the **2021 American Community Survey (ACS)**, which includes variables such as median income and racial demographics. This indicates that the ACS dataset is also relevant for their analysis.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **SafeGraph Point of Interest (POI) check-in data**, the citation is:
   > SafeGraph. (2022). *SafeGraph POI Data*. Retrieved from https://www.safegraph.com/

2. For the **2021 American Community Survey (ACS)** data, the citation is:
   > U.S. Census Bureau. (2021). *American Community Survey 5-Year Estimates*. Retrieved from https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that highlights the key details and citations for each dataset used in the research. This will ensure that the datasets are accurately represented and properly cited for future reference.
