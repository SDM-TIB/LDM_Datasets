To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Dark Web Activity Classification Using Deep Learning" by Ali Fayzi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and dataset sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions a dataset called "Darkoob," which is a strong indication that this is a key dataset used in the research. 

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Dataset)**, where the authors explicitly describe the "Darkoob" dataset. They mention that this dataset was created to detect activity titles related to five categories: buying and selling drugs, weapons, bank cards, identity documents, and illegal currencies. The authors also provide details about the data collection process, including the number of images collected and the cleaning process that resulted in 1,355 usable images.

I will also note that the authors reference another dataset, the **TOIC dataset**, which contains 698 images in similar categories. However, they indicate that access to this dataset was not provided, and they created the "Darkoob" dataset to address its limitations.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the "TOIC dataset." However, since the authors did not provide a specific citation for the "Darkoob" dataset, I will note that it is an original dataset created by the authors of this paper.

The citations I need to include are:

1. **Darkoob Dataset** (original dataset created by the authors):
   > Ali Fayzi, Mohammad Fayzi, Kourosh Dadashtabar Ahmadic. *Dark Web Activity Classification Using Deep Learning*. [Details about the dataset can be found in the paper itself.]

2. **TOIC Dataset** (no citation provided in the paper, but it is referenced):
   > The authors do not provide a full citation for the TOIC dataset, but it is mentioned as a dataset containing 698 images in 5 categories.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

- **Darkoob Dataset**: A dataset created by the authors containing 1,355 images across five categories related to dark web activities.
- **TOIC Dataset**: A referenced dataset containing 698 images in similar categories, but access was not provided.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
