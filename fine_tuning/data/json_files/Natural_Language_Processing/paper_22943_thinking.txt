To extract datasets from the research paper titled "PS-CAD: Local Geometry Guidance via Prompting and Selection for CAD Reconstruction" by Bingchen Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments using the **DeepCAD dataset**, which is a strong indication that this dataset is significant for their research.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** in detail. Here, the authors explicitly state that they used the **DeepCAD dataset** for training and also mention the **Fusion360 dataset** for cross-dataset generalization. This confirms that both datasets are relevant to their work.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

1. **DeepCAD Dataset**: The citation for the DeepCAD dataset is:
   > Wu, R., Xiao, C., & Zheng, C. (2021). DeepCAD: A Deep Generative Network for Computer-Aided Design Models. In 2021 IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision, ICCV 2021, Montreal, QC, Canada, October 10-17, 2021. IEEE, 6752–6762. https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV48922.2021.00670

2. **Fusion360 Dataset**: The citation for the Fusion360 dataset is:
   > Willis, K. D. D., Pu, Y., Luo, J., Chu, H., Du, T., Lambourne, J. G., Solar-Lezama, A., & Matusik, W. (2021). Fusion 360 gallery: a dataset and environment for programmatic CAD construction from human design sequences. ACM Transactions on Graphics, 40(4), 54:1–54:24. https://doi.org/10.1145/3450626.3459818

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, facilitating further exploration and validation of the findings presented in the paper.
