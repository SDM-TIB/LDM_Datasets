To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Beyond Night Visibility: Adaptive Multi-Scale Fusion of Infrared and Visible Images" by Shufan Pei et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on datasets, which indicates that there are datasets to be identified. I will look for specific names or descriptions of datasets in these sections.

Next, I will proceed to the **experiments section** (section 5). Here, the authors explicitly mention two datasets used for their experiments: 

1. **M3FD Dataset**: This dataset contains well-aligned infrared and visible image pairs with six detection classes. It is crucial to note the specific details provided about the dataset, such as the number of images used for training and testing.

2. **LLVIP Dataset**: This dataset consists of aligned infrared and visible night images collected in street environments, which also includes numerous annotated objects. Again, I will take note of any specific details mentioned about this dataset.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is important for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets.

For the **M3FD Dataset**, the citation is:
> Jinyuan Liu, Xin Fan, Zhanbo Huang, Guanyao Wu, Risheng Liu, Wei Zhong, and Zhongxuan Luo. *Target-aware dual adversarial learning and a multi-scenario multi-modality benchmark to fuse infrared and visible for object detection*. In CVPR, 2022.

For the **LLVIP Dataset**, the citation is:
> Xinyu Jia, Chuang Zhu, Minzhen Li, Wenqi Tang, and Wenli Zhou. *LLVIP: A visible-infrared paired dataset for low-light vision*. In CVPR, 2021.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This will ensure that all relevant details are captured and presented clearly.
