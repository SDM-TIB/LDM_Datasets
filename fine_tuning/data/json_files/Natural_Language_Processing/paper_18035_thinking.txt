To extract datasets from the research paper titled "T-FOLEY: A Controllable Waveform-Domain Diffusion Model for Temporal-Event-Guided Foley Sound Synthesis" by Yoonjin Chung et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, but the experimental setup section is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets used.

In **section 3 (Experimental Setup)**, the authors mention that they utilized a Foley sound dataset from the **2023 DCASE challenge**. This dataset comprises approximately 5,000 class-labeled sound samples, which is a significant detail. I will note the specifics of this dataset, including the number of samples, duration, and sound classes.

Next, I will look for any additional datasets mentioned in the same section. The authors also refer to two vocal mimicking datasets: **Vocal Imitation Set** and **VocalSketch**. I will extract details about these datasets, including their purpose in the study and any relevant characteristics.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

1. For the **Foley sound dataset** from the 2023 DCASE challenge, the citation is:
   > Keunwoo Choi, Jaekwon Im, Laurie M. Heller, Brian McFee, Keisuke Imoto, Yuki Okamoto, Mathieu Lagrange, and Shinnosuke Takamichi. *Foley sound synthesis at the DCASE 2023 challenge*. In Proceedings of the 8th Detection and Classification of Acoustic Scenes and Events 2023 Workshop (DCASE2023), 2023, pp. 16–20.

2. For the **Vocal Imitation Set**, the citation is:
   > Bongjun Kim, Madhav Ghei, Bryan Pardo, and Zhiyao Duan. *Vocal Imitation Set: a dataset of vocally imitated sound events using the audioset ontology*. In Proceedings of the Detection and Classification of Acoustic Scenes and Events 2018 Workshop (DCASE2018), 2018, pp. 148–152.

3. For the **VocalSketch**, the citation is:
   > Mark Cartwright and Bryan Pardo. *Vocalsketch: Vocally imitating audio concepts*. In Proceedings of the 33rd Annual ACM Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, 2015, pp. 43–46.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **Foley Sound Dataset**: Approximately 5,000 class-labeled sound samples (5.4 hours) covering 7 Foley sound classes.
2. **Vocal Imitation Set**: A dataset of vocally imitated sound events.
3. **VocalSketch**: A dataset for vocally imitating audio concepts.

Finally, I will compile all this information into a structured format for easy reference and ensure that each dataset is clearly identified with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
