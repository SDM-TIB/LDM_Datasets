To extract datasets from the research paper titled "WeatherQA: Can Multimodal Language Models Reason about Severe Weather?" by Chengqian Ma et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and dataset sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract introduces **WeatherQA**, which is described as a multimodal dataset designed for reasoning about severe weather. This indicates that a dataset is indeed present.

Next, I will focus on the **Introduction** section, where the authors mention the need for a dataset that integrates multimodal weather data with expert analyses. This reinforces the existence of a specific dataset, which I will need to detail.

In the **Dataset section (Section 3)**, the authors provide a comprehensive description of the **WeatherQA dataset**. They state that it includes **8,511 (multi-image, text) pairs** collected from the NOAA Storm Prediction Center, which is crucial for understanding severe weather events. Each pair consists of images depicting weather parameters and corresponding expert analyses.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The authors mention that the dataset is publicly accessible through a GitHub repository, which is a key detail for citation.

The full citation for the **WeatherQA dataset** is:
> Chengqian Ma, Zhanxiang Hua, Alexandra Anderson-Frey, Vikram Iyer, Xin Liu, Lianhui Qin. *WeatherQA: Can Multimodal Language Models Reason about Severe Weather?* Available at: https://github.com/chengqianma/WeatherQA.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and citation.

In summary, I have identified the **WeatherQA dataset** as the primary dataset in the paper, and I have gathered all necessary details to document it accurately.
