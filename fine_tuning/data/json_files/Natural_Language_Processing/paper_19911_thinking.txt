To extract datasets from the research paper titled "NatSGD: A Dataset with Speech, Gestures, and Demonstrations for Robot Learning in Natural Human-Robot Interaction" by Snehesh Shrestha et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract introduces the NatSGD dataset as a multimodal HRI dataset, which indicates that it is the primary dataset discussed in the paper.

Next, I will look into **section III (NatSGD Dataset)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the dataset. Here, they mention that the NatSGD dataset consists of 1,143 commands issued by 18 individuals, covering 11 actions, 20 objects, and 16 states, with each command accompanied by an expert demonstration. This section is crucial as it outlines the dataset's structure and contents.

I will also check the **experiments section** to see if the authors reference any other datasets or provide additional context about the NatSGD dataset's application in experiments. However, it appears that the focus remains on the NatSGD dataset throughout the paper.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citation for the NatSGD dataset. Since the dataset is introduced in this paper, the citation will be the same as the paper itself:

- For the NatSGD dataset, the citation is:
  > Snehesh Shrestha, Yantian Zha, Saketh Banagiri, Ge Gao, Yiannis Aloimonos, Cornelia Ferm√ºller. *NatSGD: A Dataset with Speech, Gestures, and Demonstrations for Robot Learning in Natural Human-Robot Interaction*. University of Maryland, College Park.

Since the NatSGD dataset is the only dataset explicitly mentioned in the paper, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity.

In summary, I will create an entry for the NatSGD dataset, ensuring to include the full citation as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the dataset as presented in the research paper.
