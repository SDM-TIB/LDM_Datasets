To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Early Flood Warning Using Satellite-Derived Convective System and Precipitation Data - A Retrospective Case Study of Central Vietnam" by T.-V. La et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract highlights the use of various satellite data for flood warning, which suggests that multiple datasets are involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of severe convective systems (CSs) and mention the use of advanced GEO and LEO satellites. This indicates that specific datasets related to these satellites may be referenced later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly **section 2.1 (Data selection and preparation)**, where the authors provide a table (Table 1) listing the satellite images used for their case study. The table includes:

1. **Sentinel-1**: LEO/C-SAR data for wind and flood extent.
2. **WindSat**: LEO/Radiometer data for wind and precipitation.
3. **ASCAT-A/B/C**: LEO/Scatterometer data for wind.
4. **SMAP**: LEO/Radiometer data for wind.
5. **Himawari-8**: GEO data for brightness temperature.
6. **GPM IMERG**: Multi-satellite precipitation data.

Each of these datasets is crucial for the study, and I will need to ensure I capture their details accurately.

In the **results section**, the authors validate their findings using the datasets mentioned, confirming their relevance and application in the context of the study. This reinforces the importance of the datasets listed in the methodology.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset. The citations may not be explicitly listed for datasets like satellite data, but I can reference the original sources or mission descriptions for each satellite:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
