To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Pairwise Similarity Learning is SimPLE" by Yandong Wen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses applications like open-set face recognition and image retrieval, which suggests that datasets may be involved, but I need to find specific names.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments** section. In this paper, the authors mention using datasets for evaluating their method, so I will focus on sections that detail the experiments conducted.

In the **experiments section**, I will look for specific mentions of datasets used for tasks like open-set face recognition, image retrieval, and speaker verification. The authors typically provide details about the datasets, including their sizes, characteristics, and any relevant splits (e.g., training, validation, test).

For example, I will note any datasets mentioned, such as:

1. **VGGFace2 Dataset**: This dataset is referenced in the context of face recognition tasks. I will check for details about its size and characteristics.
2. **MS1MV2 Dataset**: This dataset is mentioned as a training set for face recognition. I will gather information about its composition and any relevant statistics.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access the datasets.

For instance, I will look for citations like:

- For **VGGFace2 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Qiong Cao, Li Shen, Weidi Xie, Omkar M Parkhi, and Andrew Zisserman. *VGGFace2: A dataset for recognising faces across pose and age*. In IEEE FG, 2018.

- For **MS1MV2 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yandong Guo, Lei Zhang, Yuxiao Hu, Xiaodong He, and Jianfeng Gao. *MS-Celeb-1M: A dataset and benchmark for large-scale face recognition*. In ECCV, 2016.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, including their names, descriptions, and citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference.

Finally, I will ensure that each dataset entry includes the full citation, as this is essential for academic integrity and for readers who may wish to explore the datasets further.
