To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Convolutional Neural Networks and Vision Transformers for Fashion MNIST Classification" by Sonia Bouzidi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections that discuss datasets** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the **Fashion MNIST dataset**, indicating that it is a key dataset used in the study.

Next, I will look for a dedicated section that discusses datasets in detail. In this paper, there is a **section titled "Dataset Description"** that provides a comprehensive overview of various datasets used in the context of fashion image classification. This section lists several datasets, including:

1. **Fashion MNIST**: This dataset consists of 70,000 grayscale images representing various fashion products across 10 categories. It includes a training set of 60,000 images and a test set of 10,000 images.

2. **DeepFashion**: This dataset contains 800,000 images, which is significant for fashion-related tasks.

3. **Watch and Buy**: This dataset includes 1,042,178 images, providing a large volume of data for training models.

4. **Fashion IQ**: This dataset has 77,683 images, useful for various classification tasks.

5. **FGVCx Fashion**: This dataset consists of 55,000 images.

6. **iMaterialist**: This dataset contains 50,000 images.

7. **ModaNet**: This dataset includes 55,000 images.

8. **Chictopia10K**: This dataset has 17,706 images.

9. **DeepFashion3D**: This dataset contains 2,000 images.

I will also check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. The paper specifically mentions the Fashion MNIST dataset and provides its citation:

- For **Fashion MNIST**, the citation is:
  > Xiao, Han, Kashif Rasul, and Roland Vollgraf. *Fashion-MNIST: A Novel Image Dataset for Benchmarking Machine Learning Algorithms*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1708.07747, 2017.

For the other datasets, I will need to look for their respective citations in the references or other sections of the paper. The paper does not provide explicit citations for all datasets, but I can infer or look up the original sources for the others based on common knowledge in the field.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.
