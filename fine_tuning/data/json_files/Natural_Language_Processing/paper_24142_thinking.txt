To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DrVideo: Document Retrieval Based Long Video Understanding" by Ziyu Ma et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their full citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted extensive experiments on long video benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets and Metrics)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention three datasets:

1. **EgoSchema**: This dataset consists of 5000 multiple-choice questions sourced from 5000 three-minute egocentric videos. The authors note that only a subset of 500 questions has publicly accessible labels.

2. **MovieChat-1K**: This dataset contains 1000 videos from movies and TV shows, typically ranging from 10,000 to 12,000 frames, with each video lasting approximately 10 minutes. The authors mention that the test set is not open.

3. **LLama-Vid-QA**: This is a self-built dataset created from the MovieNet dataset and the LLama-Vid dataset. It includes hour-level videos and consists of 400 questions and 23 videos.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper:

- For **EgoSchema**, the citation is:
  > Karttikeya Mangalam, Raiymbek Akshulakov, and Jitendra Malik. *Egoschema: A diagnostic benchmark for very long-form video language understanding*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2308.09126, 2023.

- For **MovieChat-1K**, the citation is:
  > Enxin Song, Wenhao Chai, Guanhong Wang, Yucheng Zhang, Haoyang Zhou, Feiyang Wu, Xun Guo, Tian Ye, Yan Lu, Jenq-Neng Hwang, et al. *Moviechat: From dense token to sparse memory for long video understanding*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2307.16449, 2023.

- For **LLama-Vid-QA**, the citation is:
  > Yanwei Li, Chengyao Wang, and Jiaya Jia. *Llama-vid: An image is worth 2 tokens in large language models*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2311.17043, 2023.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
