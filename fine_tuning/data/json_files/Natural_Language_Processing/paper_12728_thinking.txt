To extract datasets from the research paper titled "You talk what you read: Understanding News Comment Behavior by Dispositional and Situational Attribution" by Yuhang Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus, but I need to look for specific mentions of datasets.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of understanding news comments and reference previous studies, but they do not mention any datasets directly. I will continue to the **methodology** section, where the authors describe their approach and may reference datasets used for their experiments.

In **section 4 (Experiments)**, the authors explicitly mention the construction of a new dataset called **DS-News**. They provide details about this dataset, including the total number of users, news articles, comments, and statistics about user histories. This section is crucial as it confirms the dataset's existence and provides relevant details.

Next, I will extract the full citation for the dataset. The authors mention that the dataset was constructed from **NetEase News**, a popular online news platform in China. However, they do not provide a formal citation for the dataset itself, as it appears to be a newly created dataset for this study. Therefore, I will cite it as follows:

- **DS-News Dataset**: 
  > Wang, Y., Zhang, Y., Lu, D., & Sang, J. (2023). You talk what you read: Understanding News Comment Behavior by Dispositional and Situational Attribution. *arXiv preprint arXiv:XXXX.XXXX*.

Since the dataset is derived from a specific platform (NetEase News), I will also note that in the citation.

Now, I will compile the dataset entry with the relevant details, ensuring that I include the full citation for the dataset as required. This will help in maintaining proper attribution and referencing for future use or analysis.
