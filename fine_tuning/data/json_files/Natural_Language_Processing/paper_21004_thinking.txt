To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Defense without Forgetting: Continual Adversarial Defense with Anisotropic & Isotropic Pseudo Replay" by Yuhang Zhou and Zhongyun Hua, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the concept of continual adversarial defense but does not specify datasets. Therefore, I will look for explicit mentions in the introduction and methodology.

In the **introduction**, the authors refer to the challenges of adversarial attacks and defenses but do not mention specific datasets. I will proceed to the **methodology section**, where they describe their experimental setup.

In **section 4.1 (Experimental Setup)**, the authors list three datasets used for their experiments:

1. **MNIST**: A well-known dataset of handwritten digits, commonly used for training various image processing systems. The paper mentions that they employ a smallCNN architecture for this dataset.

2. **CIFAR10**: A dataset containing 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. The authors use the WRN-34-10 architecture for this dataset.

3. **CIFAR100**: Similar to CIFAR10 but with 100 classes containing 600 images each. The authors use the WRN-34-20 architecture for this dataset.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets are typically not included in the references, as they are standard datasets widely recognized in the machine learning community. However, I will provide the standard citations for these datasets based on common knowledge:

- For **MNIST**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998.

- For **CIFAR10**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009.

- For **CIFAR100**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
