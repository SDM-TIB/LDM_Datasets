To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Computational Technologies for Fashion Recommendation: A Survey" by Yujuan Ding et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections to get an overview of the datasets that may be discussed. The introduction often provides context and may mention key datasets used in the field of fashion recommendation.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology and results sections**, particularly looking for any explicit mentions of datasets. The authors often describe the datasets used for experiments or evaluations in these sections. I will take note of any datasets mentioned, including their characteristics, such as size, type, and the specific tasks they are used for.

I will also pay close attention to the **appendices**, as they often contain detailed tables summarizing datasets, including their sources, sizes, and relevant attributes. This is where I can find comprehensive information about each dataset.

Once I have identified the datasets, I will compile the following information for each:

1. **Dataset Name**: The official name of the dataset as mentioned in the paper.
2. **Description**: A brief description of the dataset, including its purpose and the type of data it contains (e.g., images, user interactions).
3. **Source**: The origin of the dataset, such as a specific website or research project.
4. **Full Citation**: The complete reference for the dataset, including authors, title, publication venue, and year.

For example, if I find a dataset called "Polyvore," I would document it as follows:

- **Dataset Name**: Polyvore
- **Description**: A dataset containing fashion outfits created by users, including images and associated metadata.
- **Source**: Polyvore website
- **Full Citation**: McAuley, J., & Leskovec, J. (2015). Image-based recommendations on styles and substitutes. In Proceedings of the 38th International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval (SIGIR), 43-52.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will ensure that each dataset is clearly documented and formatted consistently. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets referenced in the paper, which can be useful for researchers looking to replicate or build upon the work discussed in the survey.

Finally, I will compile all the dataset entries into a structured format for easy reference and review.
