To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DELTA: Pre-train a Discriminative Encoder for Legal Case Retrieval via Structural Word Alignment" by Haitao Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted comprehensive experiments on publicly available legal benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experiment Setting)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention four datasets:

1. **LeCaRD**: This dataset is described as a widely used legal case retrieval dataset under the Chinese legal system, containing 107 queries and 43,000 candidate case documents.

2. **CAIL2022-LCR**: This dataset is provided as the test set for the CAIL2022 legal case retrieval competition, comprising 130 queries and 13,000 candidate cases.

3. **COLIEE2022**: This English dataset serves as the official dataset for the COLIEE2022 Task 1, consisting of a training set with 898 queries and 3,531 candidate cases, and a test set with 300 queries and 1,263 candidate cases.

4. **COLIEE2023**: This dataset is used for evaluating legal case retrieval techniques in the COLIEE2023 competition, containing 959 query cases against 4,400 candidate cases for training and 319 query cases against 1,335 candidate cases for testing.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **LeCaRD**, the citation is:

With all the necessary information gathered, I will now compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing.
