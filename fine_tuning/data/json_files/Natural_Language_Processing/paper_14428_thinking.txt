To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Elephant Neural Networks: Born to be a Continual Learner" by Qingfeng Lan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract states that the authors achieve excellent performance on the **Split MNIST dataset**. This indicates that there is at least one dataset to note.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for any additional datasets. The introduction discusses the challenges of catastrophic forgetting and mentions the use of various datasets in experiments, specifically highlighting the **Split MNIST dataset** again.

Moving on to the **experiments section**, I will look for a dedicated subsection that discusses datasets. In this paper, the authors conduct experiments on multiple datasets, including:

1. **Split MNIST**: This dataset is a variant of the MNIST dataset, split into multiple tasks for class incremental learning.
2. **Split CIFAR10**: Another dataset used for evaluating the performance of the proposed method in a class incremental learning setting.
3. **Split CIFAR100**: Similar to Split CIFAR10, but with a larger number of classes.
4. **Split Tiny ImageNet**: A more complex dataset used for testing the method's effectiveness in a challenging scenario.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide details about how these datasets are utilized in their experiments, confirming their relevance.

Next, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **Split MNIST**, the citation is:
  > Deng, L. (2012). The MNIST database of handwritten digit images for machine learning research. IEEE Signal Processing Magazine.

- For **Split CIFAR10** and **Split CIFAR100**, the citations are:
  > Krizhevsky, A. (2009). Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images. Master's thesis, University of Toronto.

- For **Split Tiny ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Chrabaszcz, P., Loshchilov, I., & Hutter, F. (2017). A downsampled variant of imagenet as an alternative to the cifar datasets. arXiv preprint arXiv:1707.08819.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
