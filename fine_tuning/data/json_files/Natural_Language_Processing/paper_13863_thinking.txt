To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Incorporating Class-based Language Model for Named Entity Recognition in Factorized Neural Transducer" by Peng Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for evaluation. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets, while the experiments section typically details the datasets employed in the study.

In the **experiments section (4.1)**, the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for evaluation. They state that they used the **Gigaspeech dev&test sets** for assessing general ASR performance and two named entity test sets: **Giga-name-test** and **NER-name-test**. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for the experiments conducted in the paper.

Next, I will gather detailed information about each dataset mentioned:

1. **Gigaspeech dev&test sets**: This dataset is described as a standard set used for evaluating automatic speech recognition (ASR) performance. It is part of a larger corpus that contains 10,000 hours of transcribed audio.

2. **Giga-name-test**: This test set is derived from the Gigaspeech dataset and is used to evaluate performance in the in-domain condition. It consists of 1,888 sentences with approximately 45,000 words, where 8.3% of the words are unique names.

3. **NER-name-test**: This test set contains about 1,800 sentences and is used to assess performance in out-of-domain scenarios. It has around 57,000 words, with 5.0% of the words being person names.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The paper cites the Gigaspeech dataset as follows:

- For **Gigaspeech**:
  > G. Chen, S. Chai, G. Wang, J. Du et al., “Gigaspeech: An evolving, multi-domain ASR corpus with 10,000 hours of transcribed audio,” arXiv preprint arXiv:2106.06909, 2021.

The Giga-name-test and NER-name-test datasets are derived from the Gigaspeech dataset, and their specific citations may not be separately listed, but they are referenced in the context of the Gigaspeech dataset.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for the Gigaspeech dataset, as it serves as the source for the other two test sets.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring that each dataset is clearly defined and properly cited.
