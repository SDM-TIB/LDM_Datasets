To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Foundation Model for Music Informatics" by Minz Won, Yun-Ning Hung, and Duc Le, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract discusses the challenges in music informatics due to the scarcity of labeled data, which suggests that datasets are crucial to the research. However, it does not specify any datasets directly.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section**, specifically **section 3 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for training their foundation models. Here, they state that they utilized two distinct datasets:

1. **In-house music dataset**: This dataset consists of 160,000 hours of in-house music data, designed to align with the size of the data used to train MERT.

2. **Free Music Archive (FMA) dataset**: This dataset comprises 8,000 hours of Creative Commons-licensed music audio. The authors mention that all audio files from both datasets have been preprocessed to a standard format of 24kHz mono audio.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The FMA dataset is specifically cited in the references:

- For the **Free Music Archive (FMA) dataset**, the citation is:
  > Michaël Defferrard et al., “FMA: A dataset for music analysis,” in Proc. ISMIR, 2017.

The in-house dataset does not have a formal citation since it is proprietary data created by the authors.

Next, I will compile the information about the datasets, ensuring that I include the full citation for the FMA dataset and note that the in-house dataset does not have a formal citation.

Finally, I will summarize the findings in a structured format, ready for further processing or review. This will include the names of the datasets, their descriptions, and the citations where applicable.
