To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Power Control in Wireless Networks via Adaptive Graphs" by Lorenzo Mario Amorosa et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract discusses the use of multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) for power control optimization in wireless networks, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. The introduction provides context about the challenges in applying MADRL but again does not specify any datasets.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (which is typically where datasets are discussed). In this paper, the experiments are detailed in section V, where the authors describe the simulation scenarios used to validate their approach. They mention that the experiments were conducted on a simulated network scenario comprising 11 base stations with randomly generated traffic.

Since the paper does not reference any publicly available datasets but rather describes a simulation setup, I will note that the dataset is essentially the simulated data generated for the experiments. However, I will still look for any references to existing datasets or benchmarks that might have been used for comparison.

I will also check the **references section** to see if any datasets are cited indirectly through the works referenced. The references include various papers related to multi-agent reinforcement learning and graph neural networks, but they do not appear to provide specific datasets for use in this study.

After reviewing the entire paper, I conclude that there are no external datasets explicitly mentioned or cited. The authors rely on a custom simulation environment to generate the necessary data for their experiments.

Since the paper does not provide any formal dataset citations, I will summarize the findings as follows:

1. **Simulated Network Dataset**: The experiments utilize a simulated dataset generated from a network scenario with 11 base stations and user traffic modeled as a Poisson cluster process. However, there are no formal citations for this dataset as it is not publicly available.

In this case, I will document the findings without specific dataset citations, as the authors did not reference any external datasets. This is an important aspect to note when extracting datasets from research papers, as not all studies utilize publicly available datasets.

In summary, I will prepare a structured output that reflects the findings regarding the dataset used in the paper, emphasizing that it is a simulated dataset without formal citation.
