To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Analyzing Currency Fluctuations: A Comparative Study of GARCH, EWMA, and IV Models for GBP/USD and EUR/GBP Pairs" by Narayan Tondapu, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the study utilizes data from June 15, 2018, to June 15, 2023, focusing on GBP/USD and EUR/GBP currency pairs. This suggests that the datasets are related to these currency pairs over the specified time period.

Next, I will examine **section 3 (Empirical Study)**, particularly **subsection 3.1 (Data Analysis)**, where the author describes the data collection process. The paper states that data was gathered from **Yahoo Finance**, which included daily market prices of the currency pairs. This is a crucial detail as it specifies the source of the dataset.

In this section, the author also mentions that the daily returns were calculated using the closing prices, which further confirms the nature of the dataset. The analysis includes visualizations of the daily prices and returns for both GBP/USD and EUR/GBP pairs, indicating that the datasets are time series data reflecting daily fluctuations.

Now, I will look for the **full citations** for the datasets mentioned. Since the paper does not provide formal citations for the datasets, I will create a citation based on the information provided in the text. The citation for the dataset can be structured as follows:

1. **GBP/USD Dataset**: 
   - Source: Yahoo Finance
   - Description: Daily market prices of the GBP/USD currency pair from June 15, 2018, to June 15, 2023.

2. **EUR/GBP Dataset**: 
   - Source: Yahoo Finance
   - Description: Daily market prices of the EUR/GBP currency pair from June 15, 2018, to June 15, 2023.

Next, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as described above.

Finally, I will summarize the findings and prepare the dataset entries for further processing or review.
