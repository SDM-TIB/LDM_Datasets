To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Bridging MDE and AI: A Systematic Review of Domain-Specific Languages and Model-Driven Practices in AI Software Systems Engineering" by Simon RÃ¤dler et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's objectives and may hint at the datasets used. 

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly the **data extraction process** described in detail. This section outlines how the authors collected and analyzed data from various studies, which may include specific datasets they referenced or utilized in their systematic literature review.

In the **results section**, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, especially in the context of the studies they reviewed. The authors may discuss datasets used in the primary studies they analyzed, which could provide valuable information.

After identifying potential datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for ensuring proper attribution and for anyone who may want to access the datasets.

For example, if the authors mention a dataset like the **Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset**, I would look for its citation in the references. The citation might look something like this:
> Smith, J., & Doe, A. (2018). *Pima Indians Diabetes Database*. UCI Machine Learning Repository.

If the paper discusses multiple datasets, I will repeat this process for each one, ensuring I capture the necessary details such as the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation.

Finally, I will compile all the extracted datasets into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited, ready for further analysis or review.
