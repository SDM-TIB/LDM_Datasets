To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Counting the Bugs in ChatGPT’s Wugs: A Multilingual Investigation into the Morphological Capabilities of a Large Language Model" by Leonie Weissweiler et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted a rigorous analysis using novel, uncontaminated datasets for four languages, which suggests that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Data and Morphological Constructions)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. They mention datasets for four languages: **English, German, Tamil, and Turkish**. Each language has a specific dataset created for the morphological wug test.

1. **English Dataset**: The authors created a dataset using 50 irregular verbs sampled from the UniMorph 4.0 dataset. They perturbed these verbs to create nonce words and collected responses from 28 annotators.

2. **German Dataset**: This dataset consists of 200 nonce nouns generated from existing German nouns using the Unipseudo algorithm. The final set includes 174 nonce nouns annotated by 21 volunteer annotators.

3. **Tamil Dataset**: The dataset includes 86 common Tamil verbs conjugated with various tense and person-number-gender suffixes. Nonce verbs were created by combining syllables from real verb roots, and five native Tamil speakers provided past tense forms.

4. **Turkish Dataset**: The authors created four datasets with different levels of complexity, focusing on inflectional features. The data was produced by a single Turkish annotator.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations of the original datasets mentioned. The paper references the following:

- For the **UniMorph 4.0 dataset**, the citation is:
  > Khuyagbaatar Batsuren, et al. *UniMorph 4.0: Universal Morphology*. In Proceedings of the Thirteenth Language Resources and Evaluation Conference, pages 840–855, 2022.

- For the **Unipseudo algorithm**, the citation is:
  > Unipseudo. *http://www.lexique.org/shiny/unipseudo/*.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations into a structured format for clarity and future reference. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets and their sources as required.
