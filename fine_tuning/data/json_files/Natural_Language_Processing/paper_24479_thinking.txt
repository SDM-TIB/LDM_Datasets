To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Medical Image Segmentation Using Directional Window Attention" by Daniya Najiha A. Kareem et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract highlights the use of two datasets for experiments: the **3D Synapse Multi-organ dataset** and the **Cell HMS dataset**. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for the research.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (specifically section 3) where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used. In this section, they describe the **3D Synapse Multi-organ dataset** as containing 30 abdominal CT scans with segmentation tasks for eight organs, and the **Cell HMS dataset** as containing 36 images of zebrafish cells.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The paper mentions the following:

1. **3D Synapse Multi-organ dataset**: The citation is:
   > Bennett Landman et al. "Miccai multi-atlas labeling beyond the cranial vault–workshop and challenge." In Proc. MICCAI Multi-Atlas Labeling Beyond Cranial Vault—Workshop Challenge, 2015, vol. 5, p. 12.

2. **Cell HMS dataset**: The citation is:
   > Andong Wang et al. "A novel deep learning-based 3D cell segmentation framework for future image-based disease detection." Scientific Reports, vol. 12, no. 1, pp. 1–15, 2022.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will summarize the key details for each dataset:

- **3D Synapse Multi-organ dataset**: This dataset includes 30 abdominal CT scans with segmentation tasks for eight organs, specifically designed for medical image segmentation tasks.

- **Cell HMS dataset**: This dataset consists of 36 images of zebrafish cells, constructed for microscopic cell segmentation tasks.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all necessary information is accurately represented for future reference or processing.
