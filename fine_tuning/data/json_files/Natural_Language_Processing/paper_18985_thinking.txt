To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Amplifying Exploration in Monte-Carlo Tree Search by Focusing on the Unknown" by Cedric Derstroff et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a high-level overview of the research but may not detail specific datasets. The introduction often contextualizes the research and may reference datasets used in prior work.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as this is where authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this paper, the authors mention three environments: **Chain**, **ChainLoop**, and **FrozenLake**. I will look for any specific references to datasets associated with these environments.

In the **experiments section**, the authors describe the environments in detail. They mention that the **FrozenLake** environment is based on the classical FrozenLake gym environment, which is a well-known dataset in reinforcement learning. The citation for this dataset can be found in the references section.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. **FrozenLake Environment**: The citation is:
   > Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L., Schneider, J., Schulman, J., Tang, J., & Zaremba, W. (2016). OpenAI Gym. 

2. **Chain and ChainLoop Environments**: The authors reference the work of Moerland et al. (2018) for these environments, which means I need to find the citation for that paper as well:
   > Moerland, T. M., Broekens, J., Plaat, A., & Jonker, C. M. (2018). Monte Carlo Tree Search for Asymmetric Trees. arXiv:1805.09218.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required.

In summary, I will document the following datasets:
- **FrozenLake Environment**: OpenAI Gym (Brockman et al., 2016).
- **Chain and ChainLoop Environments**: Referenced from Moerland et al. (2018).

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring that all citations are accurately represented.
