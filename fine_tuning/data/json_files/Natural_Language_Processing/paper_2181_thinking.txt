To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Beyond Next Item Recommendation: Recommending and Evaluating List of Sequences" by Makbule Gulcin Ozsoy, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and evaluation sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the proposed method can be used in different domains, which suggests that datasets are likely discussed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Evaluation)**, where the author explicitly mentions the datasets used for experiments. Here, I will look for any specific names or descriptions of datasets that are utilized in the experiments.

In this section, the author identifies two datasets:

1. **LearNext dataset**: This dataset contains tourists' movements collected from photos shared on Flickr. It includes data from three different cities (Pisa, Florence, and Rome) and is specifically noted that the large dataset from Rome is used for the experiments.

2. **30Music dataset**: This dataset consists of listening and playlist data retrieved from Last.fm. It organizes play events as listening sessions, which allows for the use of session information as input sequences for the recommendation system.

Now, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **LearNext dataset**, the citation is:
  > Ranieri Baraglia, Cristina Ioana Muntean, Franco Maria Nardini, and Fabrizio Silvestri. *LearNext: learning to predict tourists movements*. In Proceedings of the 22nd ACM international conference on Information & Knowledge Management. ACM, 751â€“756, 2013.

- For the **30Music dataset**, the citation is:
  > Roberto Turrin, Massimo Quadrana, Andrea Condorelli, Roberto Pagano, and Paolo Cremonesi. *30Music Listening and Playlists Dataset*. In RecSys Posters, 2015.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets and their citations clearly, ensuring that I have accurately captured all necessary details for future reference or processing. This structured approach will help in maintaining clarity and completeness in the dataset extraction process.
