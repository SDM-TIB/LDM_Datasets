To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ROBBIE: Robust Bias Evaluation of Large Generative Language Models" by David Esiobu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets along with their full citations.

1. **Initial Reading**: I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract highlights the introduction of two novel datasets, **AdvPromptSet** and **HolisticBiasR**, which are crucial for the study.

2. **Identifying Sections**: Next, I will look into the **Methods** section, particularly the subsections that discuss datasets. This section typically provides detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the experiments.

3. **Dataset Extraction**:
   - In the **Methods** section, I will find the following datasets:
     - **AdvPromptSet**: A novel dataset created for evaluating bias across various demographic axes, consisting of 197,628 prompts.
     - **HolisticBiasR**: An extension of the Regard dataset, which incorporates additional demographic terms to measure bias.
     - **Regard**: A dataset used to measure the model's regard for different demographic groups.
     - **RealToxicityPrompts**: A dataset for evaluating toxicity in model outputs.
     - **BOLD**: A dataset for measuring biases in open-ended language generation.
     - **ToxiGen (v2)**: A dataset for adversarial and implicit hate speech detection.

4. **Confirming Usage**: I will check the **Experiments** section to confirm that these datasets were indeed used in the experiments, ensuring that I only include datasets that were actively utilized in the study.

5. **Retrieving Citations**: I will then refer to the **References** section to find the full citations for each dataset:
   - For **AdvPromptSet**, the citation is:

   - For **BOLD**, the citation is:

   - For **ToxiGen (v2)**, the citation is:

6. **Final Compilation**: After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset names along with their descriptions and citations into a structured format for easy reference.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and cite all relevant datasets from the paper.
