To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Dissecting usersâ€™ needs for search result explanations" by Prerna Juneja et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, results, and discussion sections** to look for any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus, but it may not explicitly mention datasets. Therefore, I will pay close attention to the introduction and methods sections, as they often detail the data collection process and any datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the need for transparency in search engines and the importance of understanding user perspectives. However, they do not mention specific datasets at this point.

Next, I will examine the **methods section**, where the authors describe their research design. They mention conducting an online survey and semi-structured interviews with participants. I will look for any datasets that may have been collected from these methods. The authors specify that they used Prolific and Upwork for participant recruitment, but they do not explicitly name any datasets.

Moving on to the **results section**, I will look for any data presented in tables or figures that may indicate the use of datasets. The authors present findings based on participant responses, but again, they do not refer to specific datasets.

Finally, I will check the **discussion section** for any references to datasets used in the analysis or any external datasets that may have informed their research. The authors discuss the implications of their findings but do not mention any datasets.

After thoroughly reviewing the paper, it appears that the authors did not explicitly mention any datasets by name. However, they did collect qualitative data from interviews and surveys, which could be considered a dataset in a broader sense.

Since no specific datasets were identified in the paper, I will not be able to provide full citations for datasets. Instead, I will summarize the data collection methods used in the study:

1. **Online Survey Dataset**: Collected responses from participants recruited via Prolific and Upwork, focusing on user needs for search explanations.
2. **Interview Dataset**: Qualitative data gathered from semi-structured interviews with 12 non-technical users to explore their perspectives on search explanations.

As there are no formal citations for external datasets, I will conclude my extraction process here. If any datasets had been mentioned, I would have looked for their full citations in the references section to ensure proper documentation.
