To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Independent RL for Cooperative-Competitive Agents: A Mean-Field Perspective" by Muhammad Aneeq uz Zaman et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, experiments, and conclusion sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for experiments or evaluations.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as this is typically where authors describe the datasets used for their experiments in detail. I will look for any specific names of datasets, descriptions of their contents, and any relevant statistics (e.g., number of samples, types of data, etc.).

If the paper includes a **datasets section**, I will pay close attention to it, as it will likely contain comprehensive information about the datasets used, including their sources and any modifications made by the authors.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For each dataset identified, I will note the following details:
1. **Dataset Name**: The official name of the dataset.
2. **Description**: A brief description of the dataset, including its purpose and contents.
3. **Citation**: The full citation for the dataset as it appears in the references section of the paper.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile it into a structured format that clearly presents each dataset along with its details and citation.

Finally, I will ensure that all citations are formatted correctly according to the style used in the paper, as this is essential for academic integrity and proper referencing.
