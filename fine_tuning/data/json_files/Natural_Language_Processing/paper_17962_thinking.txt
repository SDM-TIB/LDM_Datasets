To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SAMF: Small-Area-Aware Multi-Focus Image Fusion for Object Detection" by Xilai Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, proposed method, experiments, and conclusion sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study and hints at the datasets used, particularly mentioning the construction of a real-world MFIF dataset called **Road-MF**.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors discuss the challenges of multi-focus image fusion and the importance of accurately detecting small focus areas. This section may provide context for the datasets used in their experiments.

In the **proposed method** section, I will look for any detailed descriptions of the datasets utilized in their experiments. The authors mention the **Road-MF dataset**, which consists of 80 pairs of images taken against vehicles on a road, specifically designed for object detection tasks.

Moving on to the **experiments section**, I will check for any additional datasets mentioned. The authors compare their method against other state-of-the-art methods using three datasets: **Lytro**, **MFI-WHU**, and **Road-MF**. This confirms that these datasets are integral to their evaluation.

Finally, I will consult the **references section** to gather full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations I will extract are:

1. **Road-MF Dataset**: Since this dataset is newly constructed by the authors, I will note that it is referenced in the paper but does not have a separate citation. I will include a description of it as follows:
   > Xilai Li, Xiaosong Li, Haishu Tan, Jinyang Li. *Road-MF Dataset for Multi-Focus Image Fusion*. This dataset comprises 80 pairs of images taken against vehicles on a road, specifically designed for object detection tasks.

2. **Lytro Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Mansour Nejati, Shadrokh Samavi, and Shahram Shirani. *Multi-focus image fusion using dictionary-based sparse representation*. Information Fusion, vol. 25, pp. 72–84, 2015.

3. **MFI-WHU Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Hao Zhang, Zhuliang Le, Zhenfeng Shao, Han Xu, and Jiayi Ma. *MFF-GAN: An unsupervised generative adversarial network with adaptive and gradient joint constraints for multi-focus image fusion*. Information Fusion, vol. 66, pp. 40–53, 2021.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
