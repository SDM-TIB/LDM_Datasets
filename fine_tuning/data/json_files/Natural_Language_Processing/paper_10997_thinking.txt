To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Examining risks of racial biases in NLP tools for child protective services" by Anjalie Field et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on demographic bias in NLP models, particularly in the context of child protective services (CPS). This indicates that there may be specific datasets related to CPS that are utilized in the research.

Next, I will focus on **section 1 (Data: CPS Contact Notes)**, where the authors describe their primary dataset. They mention that they are working with **3,105,071 contact notes** written by CPS workers in the Department of Human Services (DHS) in an anonymous county from approximately 2010 to November 23, 2020. This dataset is crucial for their analysis of racial disparities in NLP models.

In **section 4 (Racial Disparities in Information Extraction Systems)**, the authors discuss the use of various NLP models, but they do not introduce new datasets. Instead, they analyze the performance of existing models on the contact notes dataset mentioned earlier.

I will also check the **References section** to find any citations related to the datasets used. However, since the primary dataset is specific to the authors' research and not a publicly available dataset, it may not have a formal citation like other datasets.

The key dataset identified is:
1. **CPS Contact Notes**: This dataset consists of over 3 million contact notes written by caseworkers, supervisors, and service providers in the DHS. It includes metadata such as case open and close dates, lists of associated clients, and mappings between cases, referrals, and clients.

Since the dataset is unique to this study and does not have a formal citation in the traditional sense, I will document it as follows:

- **CPS Contact Notes**: An internal dataset comprising 3,105,071 contact notes from the DHS in an anonymous county, covering the period from 2010 to November 23, 2020.

Now, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format that highlights the dataset's significance and context within the research.

In summary, I have identified the primary dataset used in the research and will ensure to document it accurately, emphasizing its relevance to the study's findings on racial biases in NLP tools for child protective services.
