To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ON THE ESTIMATION RATE OF BAYESIAN PINN FOR INVERSE PROBLEMS" by Yi Sun, Debarghya Mukherjee, and Yves Atchadé, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the datasets used.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **methods or experiments sections**. These sections typically detail the data used for simulations or experiments. I will pay attention to any descriptions of data sources, types of data, and how they were utilized in the study.

In this paper, the authors discuss using simulated data generated from a specific partial differential equation (PDE) model. They mention that the observed data consists of noisy measurements of the solution to the PDE, which indicates that the dataset is synthetic rather than sourced from an external repository.

I will summarize the dataset as follows:

1. **Synthetic Dataset**: The authors generated synthetic data based on the heat equation with a known parameter θ. The dataset consists of noisy observations of the solution to the PDE at various sensor locations.

Next, I will check the **references section** to see if there are any citations related to the datasets or methodologies used to generate them. However, since the dataset is synthetic and generated for the purpose of this study, there may not be a formal citation for it.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, ensuring to include a clear description of the dataset and any relevant details about its generation or use in the study.

The final output will include the dataset name, a brief description, and any relevant citations if applicable. Since this dataset is synthetic and not sourced from an external repository, I will note that in the description.

In summary, the steps are:
1. Read the abstract, introduction, and methods sections for mentions of datasets.
2. Identify the nature of the dataset (synthetic or sourced).
3. Summarize the dataset details.
4. Check references for any related citations.
5. Compile the dataset information for output.

This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture the necessary details about the datasets used in the research paper.
