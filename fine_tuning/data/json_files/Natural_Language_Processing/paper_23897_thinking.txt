To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CUDRT: Benchmarking the Detection of Human vs. Large Language Models Generated Texts" by Zhen Tao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to gather initial insights about the datasets. The abstract mentions the construction of a comprehensive bilingual benchmark to evaluate AI-generated text detectors, which indicates that datasets are likely included.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly the parts that describe the dataset creation process. The authors categorize LLM text generation into five operations: Creation, Updating, Deletion, Rewriting, and Translation (CUDRT). Each category is likely to have associated datasets.

In the **CUDRT section**, the authors detail the datasets created for each operation. They mention that they collected texts from news articles and academic papers in both Chinese and English. The specific datasets include:

1. **Creation Operation**: This includes datasets for "Complete" and "Question Answering" tasks, with 5,000 samples each from various domains such as news and academic theses.

2. **Updating Operation**: This includes datasets for "Polish" and "Expand" tasks, also with 5,000 samples each, focusing on improving the quality of existing texts.

3. **Deletion Operation**: This includes datasets for "Summary" and "Refine" tasks, with 3,000 samples for summarization and 5,000 for refinement.

4. **Rewriting Operation**: This includes datasets for rewriting tasks, with 5,000 samples.

5. **Translation Operation**: This includes datasets for English-Chinese translation, with 5,000 samples.

Next, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. The authors reference existing datasets and benchmarks, such as:

- **HC3 Dataset**: Guo et al. (2023) created a dataset named Human ChatGPT Comparison Corpus (HC3), which includes about 40,000 questions and responses from human experts and ChatGPT.

- **MGTBench**: He et al. (2023) proposed a new English benchmark framework called MGTBench.

- **HPPT Dataset**: Yang et al. (2023) introduced a dataset specifically designed for AI-generated text detection.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will include the dataset name, a brief description, and the citation for each dataset.

Finally, I will ensure that the citations are formatted correctly and are complete, as this is crucial for proper attribution and further reference.
