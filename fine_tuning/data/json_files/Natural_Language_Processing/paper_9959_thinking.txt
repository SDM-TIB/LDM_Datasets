To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ML-Enabled Outdoor User Positioning in 5G NR Systems via Uplink SRS Channel Estimates" by Andre Ráth et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract discusses the use of Sounding Reference Signals (SRS) channel estimates for user positioning, which suggests that there may be datasets related to these measurements.

Next, I will focus on the **data collection and methodology section**. Here, the authors describe the experimental setup and the data collection process. They mention collecting three distinct datasets for different scenarios: training, validation, and test datasets. Specifically, they refer to:

1. **LoS-D (Line of Sight Dense Walk)**: This dataset was collected in a dense walking area for training, validation, and testing on the same day.
2. **LoS-A (Line of Sight)**: This dataset was collected along a predictable path, with training data collected a week before the validation and test datasets.
3. **NLoS-A (Non-Line of Sight)**: This dataset was collected in a scenario with obstructed signals, with training and validation datasets collected on separate days.

In the **results and discussion section**, the authors provide performance metrics for each dataset, which further confirms their existence and relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper does not provide specific citations for the datasets themselves, as they are likely proprietary or experimental datasets generated during the study. However, I will note the relevant references that discuss similar methodologies or datasets in the context of 5G positioning:

- For the general context of 5G positioning, I will cite:
  > H. Wymeersch et al., “5G mmWave Positioning for Vehicular Networks,” IEEE Wireless Communications, vol. 24, no. 6, pp. 80-86, Dec. 2017.

- For the use of SRS in positioning, I will cite:
  > F. Wang et al., “SRS-based LTE indoor wireless positioning system,” 2017 IEEE 2nd Advanced Information Technology, Electronic and Automation Control Conference (IAEAC), Chongqing, China, pp. 2356-2359, March 2017.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **LoS-D Dataset**: Collected in a dense walking area for training, validation, and testing on the same day.
2. **LoS-A Dataset**: Collected along a predictable path, with training data collected a week before the validation and test datasets.
3. **NLoS-A Dataset**: Collected in a scenario with obstructed signals, with training and validation datasets collected on separate days.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries along with their citations into a structured format for further processing or review.
