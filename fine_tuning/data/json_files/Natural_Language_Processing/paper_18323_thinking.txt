To extract datasets from the research paper titled "INTELLI-Z: TOWARD INTELLIGIBLE ZERO-SHOT TTS" by Sunghee Jung et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a general overview of the study but does not specify datasets. The introduction discusses the challenges of zero-shot TTS but does not mention specific datasets either.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments and Results)**, particularly **subsection 4.1 (Dataset)**, where the authors explicitly mention the dataset used in their experiments. Here, they state that they utilized a publicly available Korean multi-speaker corpus, which is divided into three subsets with varying numbers of sentences per person.

In this subsection, the authors provide details about the dataset:
- The dataset comprises three subsets with 2,400, 4,800, and 12,000 sentences per person, respectively.
- The subset containing 2,400 sentences per person was used for training, involving 1,872 speakers, while the other subsets were reserved for evaluation.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset mentioned. The authors reference the dataset as a publicly available Korean multi-speaker corpus, and I will look for the corresponding citation:

- The citation for the dataset is:
  > AIHub. "AIHub Korean Multi-Speaker Corpus." Available at: https://www.aihub.or.kr/aihubdata/data/view.do?currMenu=115&topMenu=100&aihubDataSe=realm&dataSetSn=542. Accessed: 2022-10-19.

Since this is the only dataset mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that the full citation is included.

After gathering all the necessary details, I will prepare the dataset entry for review or further processing.
