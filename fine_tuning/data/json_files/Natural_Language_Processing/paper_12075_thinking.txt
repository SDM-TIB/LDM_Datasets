To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fairness-Aware Graph Neural Networks: A Survey" by April Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by scanning the **abstract and introduction** sections for any mentions of datasets. The introduction provides context and may reference specific datasets used in the research or literature.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Datasets)**, as this section is likely to contain a detailed summary of the datasets used for evaluating fairness in GNNs. I will look for a table or list that outlines the datasets, their characteristics, and any relevant statistics such as the number of nodes, edges, and sensitive attributes.

In the provided text, I see that **Table 2** summarizes various datasets, including their names, characteristics, and the tasks they were used for. I will extract the following datasets from this table:

1. **ML-100K**: A dataset used for recommendation tasks with 2,625 nodes and 100,000 edges. It includes sensitive attributes such as gender, age, and job.
   - Citation: 
     > GroupLens Research. *MovieLens 100K Dataset*. https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/100k/

2. **ML-1M**: Another recommendation dataset with 10,040 nodes and 1,000,000 edges, also containing sensitive attributes like gender, age, and job.
   - Citation: 
     > GroupLens Research. *MovieLens 1M Dataset*. https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/1m/

3. **LastFM**: A dataset with 49,900 nodes and 518,647 edges, used for recommendation tasks.
   - Citation: 
     > Last.fm. *Last.fm Dataset*. https://www.last.fm/api

4. **Amazon**: A dataset with 334,863 nodes and 925,872 edges, used for recommendation tasks.
   - Citation: 
     > Amazon. *Amazon Product Dataset*. https://jmcauley.ucsd.edu/data/amazon/

5. **Yelp**: A dataset with 12,683 nodes and 211,721 edges, used for recommendation tasks.
   - Citation: 
     > Yelp. *Yelp Dataset Challenge*. https://www.yelp.com/dataset

6. **Pokec**: A social network dataset with 1.63M nodes and 30.6M edges.
   - Citation: 
     > Leskovec, J., & Krevl, A. *Pokec Dataset*. https://snap.stanford.edu/data/soc-Pokec.html

7. **Twitter**: A dataset with 81,306 nodes and 1,768,149 edges, used for social network analysis.
   - Citation: 
     > Twitter. *Twitter Dataset*. https://archive.org/details/twitterdata

8. **Cora**: A citation network dataset with 2,708 nodes and 5,201 edges.
   - Citation: 
     > McCallum, A., & Kolla, S. *Cora Dataset*. https://relational.fit.cvut.cz/dataset/CORA

9. **Citeseer**: Another citation network dataset with 3,327 nodes and 10,621 edges.
   - Citation: 
     > Citeseer. *Citeseer Dataset*. https://cs.stanford.edu/people/william/citeseer/

10. **Pubmed**: A dataset with 19,717 nodes and 44,338 edges.
    - Citation: 
      > Pubmed. *Pubmed Dataset*. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/tools/openft/

After identifying these datasets, I will ensure that I have the correct citations for each dataset, as they are crucial for proper referencing in any subsequent work.

Finally, I will compile the extracted datasets and their citations into a structured format for easy access and review.
