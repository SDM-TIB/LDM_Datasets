To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Stable Learning in Source-Free Domain Adaptation for Medical Image Segmentation" by Yixin Chen and Yan Wang, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments using two public datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments and Discussions)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. In **section 4.1 (Dataset and Metrics)**, they describe the datasets as follows:

1. **Abdominal Dataset**: This dataset consists of 20 MRI scans from the CHAOS challenge and 30 CT scans from the Multi-Atlas Labeling Beyond the Cranial Vault Workshop and Challenge. The MRI scans are 3D volumes of 256 × 256 × L voxels, and the CT scans are 512 × 512 × L 3D volumes. The ground truth masks are annotated for liver, right kidney, left kidney, and spleen.

2. **Cardiac Dataset**: This dataset is used for another set of domain adaptation experiments, although specific details about the number of scans or their characteristics are not provided in the same section. However, it is mentioned in the results that the cardiac dataset includes segmentation tasks for structures like the ascending aorta, left atrium blood cavity, left ventricle blood cavity, and myocardium of the left ventricle.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **CHAOS challenge**, the citation is:
  > Kavur, A.E., Gezer, N.S., Barış, M., Aslan, S., Conze, P.H., Groza, V., Pham, D.D., Chatterjee, S., Ernst, P., Özkan, S., et al. *Chaos challenge-combined (CT-MR) healthy abdominal organ segmentation*. Medical Image Analysis 69, 101950 (2021).

- For the **Multi-Atlas Labeling Beyond the Cranial Vault**, the citation is:
  > Landman, B., Xu, Z., Iglesias, J., Styner, M., Langerak, T., Klein, A. *Multi-atlas labeling beyond the cranial vault*. URL: https://www.synapse.org (2015).

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will prepare the information for structured output or further processing.
