To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Continual Learning through Networks Splitting and Merging with Dreaming-Meta-Weighted Model Fusion" by Yi Sun et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the proposed method and hints at the datasets used for evaluation. The introduction typically elaborates on the problem being addressed and may mention specific datasets.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used in their experiments. This section is crucial as it usually contains detailed information about the datasets, including their characteristics and how they were utilized in the study.

In **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, the authors mention three datasets:

1. **CIFAR100**: This dataset consists of 60,000 images, each of size 32x32 pixels, divided into 100 classes. Each class contains 500 training images and 100 testing images. The authors note that they split CIFAR100 into 10 disjoint sub-datasets for their experiments.

2. **TinyImageNet**: This dataset contains 120,000 images with a size of 64x64 pixels, organized into 200 classes. Each class has 500 training images, 50 validation images, and 50 testing images. The authors mention that they split this dataset into 25 disjoint sub-datasets.

3. **PASCAL-VOC 2012**: This dataset is used for semantic segmentation and contains 20 classes. The authors adopt the same settings as a previous work (PLOP) and split the dataset into three types of sub-datasets for continual learning.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is important for proper attribution and to provide readers with sources for further exploration.

The citations I will extract are:

- For **CIFAR100**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton, et al. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. 2009.

- For **TinyImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Jiayu Wu, Qixiang Zhang, and Guoxi Xu. *Tiny ImageNet Challenge*. Technical report, 2017.

- For **PASCAL-VOC 2012**, the citation is:
  > Mark Everingham, SM Ali Eslami, Luc Van Gool, Christopher KI Williams, John Winn, and Andrew Zisserman. *The PASCAL Visual Object Classes Challenge: A Retrospective*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 111:98â€“136, 2015.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details or citations.
