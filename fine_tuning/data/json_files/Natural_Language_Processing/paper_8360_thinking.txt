To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Adaptive Selection of the Optimal Strategy to Improve Precision and Power in Randomized Trials" by Laura B. Balzer et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, results, and discussion sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a concise overview, and I will look for any mentions of datasets or data sources used in the research.

In the **introduction**, I will look for references to previous studies or datasets that the authors may have used or built upon. This section often contains background information that can lead to identifying datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, where the authors typically describe their experimental design and data collection processes. Here, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics. The authors may also describe how they utilized real data, such as the ACTG Study 175, which is mentioned in the paper.

In the **results section**, I will check for any tables or figures that summarize data or results derived from specific datasets. This can provide additional context about the datasets used and their relevance to the study's findings.

Finally, I will review the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned in the paper. This is crucial for ensuring that I have accurate and complete citations for each dataset.

Based on my reading, I have identified the following datasets:

1. **ACTG Study 175**: This dataset is used to evaluate the effect of antiretroviral therapy on health outcomes among persons with HIV. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Hammer, S. M., Katzenstein, D. A., Hughes, M. D., Gundacker, H., Schooley, R. T., Haubrich, R. H., et al. (1996). A trial comparing nucleoside monotherapy with combination therapy in HIV-infected adults with CD4 cell counts from 200 to 500 per mm3. *NEJM*, 335(15), 1081â€“1090.

2. **Simulated Datasets**: The authors conducted simulations with various data generating processes (DGPs) to evaluate their methods. While these datasets are not publicly available, they are described in detail in the methods section. The specific simulations include:
   - Linear, Interactive, and Polynomial DGPs for binary and continuous outcomes.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as specified. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
