To extract datasets from the research paper titled "WebGLM: Towards An Efficient Web-Enhanced Question Answering System with Human Preferences" by Hanyu Lai et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the development of WebGLM and mentions the use of a bootstrapped dataset for training, which indicates that there may be specific datasets referenced later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors describe the creation of the **WebGLM-QA dataset**, which is a key dataset used for training their model. I will extract the details about this dataset, including its size and characteristics.

In the **methodology section**, the authors mention that the WebGLM-QA dataset consists of 45,000 high-quality samples after filtering and 83,000 noisy but diverse samples before filtering. This dataset is crucial for training the bootstrapped generator.

I will also check the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. The paper references the **ELI5 dataset**, which is used for comparison and evaluation. The citation for the ELI5 dataset is as follows:
- For the ELI5 dataset:
  > Angela Fan, Yacine Jernite, Ethan Perez, David Grangier, Jason Weston, and Michael Auli. *ELI5: Long Form Question Answering*. In Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, pages 3558â€“3567, 2019.

Now, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset. The datasets I will document are:

1. **WebGLM-QA Dataset**: A quoted and long-formed QA dataset with 45k high-quality samples and 83k noisy samples.
2. **ELI5 Dataset**: A dataset used for long-form question answering.

Finally, I will ensure that the citations are formatted correctly and ready for inclusion in any further documentation or analysis.
