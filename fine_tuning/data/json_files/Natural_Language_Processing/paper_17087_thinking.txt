To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Deep Learning-Based System for Automatic Case Summarization" by Minh Duong et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and system description sections** to look for any references to datasets. The abstract mentions a system that summarizes legal case documents, but it does not specify any datasets. I will need to dig deeper into the introduction and system description for more details.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of analyzing legal texts and mention that their system utilizes a fine-tuned multilingual BERT model trained on a large dataset of Vietnamese legal cases. However, they do not provide a specific name for this dataset.

Next, I will examine the **system description** section. Here, the authors describe the architecture of their summarization system and mention that it employs a supervised method based on a large dataset of Vietnamese legal cases. Again, no specific dataset name is provided.

Since the paper does not explicitly name any datasets, I will check the **references section** to see if any cited works might contain relevant datasets. The references include various papers related to legal document summarization and natural language processing, but they do not seem to provide a specific dataset citation.

Given that the paper does not provide explicit dataset names or citations, I will summarize my findings:

1. The authors mention using a large dataset of Vietnamese legal cases for training their BERT model, but they do not specify the dataset's name or provide a citation.
2. There are no other datasets mentioned in the paper.

Since I cannot find any specific datasets or their citations, I will conclude that this paper does not provide the necessary information to extract datasets in the required format. If I were to document this, I would note that while the authors refer to a dataset, it lacks a formal citation or name.

In summary, I will prepare a note indicating that no datasets were explicitly identified in the paper, and therefore, no citations can be provided.
