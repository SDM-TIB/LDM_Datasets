To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Reinforcement Learning Control Strategies for Electric Vehicles and Renewable Energy Sources Virtual Power Plants" by Francesco Maldonato, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of Electric Vehicles (EVs) and renewable energy sources, which suggests that there may be datasets related to energy consumption, EV charging events, and renewable energy production.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Pre-processing and analysis)**, where the author explicitly mentions the datasets used. Here, I will look for specific names and descriptions of the datasets. The author mentions several datasets:

1. **Elvis Simulation Dataset**: This dataset is generated by the Elvis simulation tool, which models EV charging events, including arrival times, departure times, and state of charge (SoC) at arrival. It is crucial for understanding the behavior of EVs in the VPP context.

2. **Renewables Ninja Dataset**: This dataset provides simulated hourly power output from wind and solar PV farms. It is used to model renewable energy production in the VPP.

3. **Pecan Street Dataport**: This dataset includes energy market prices, specifically the Day-ahead prices from the Entsoe transparency platform, which are essential for understanding the economic aspects of energy consumption.

4. **Low-Voltage Load Forecasting Dataset**: This dataset contains time series of electricity readings from energy consumers in Germany, which is used to model household energy consumption.

In **section 3.3 (Data-sets source)**, the author provides details about the sources of these datasets, which will help in retrieving full citations.

Now, I will compile the full citations for each dataset based on the information provided in the paper:

- For the **Elvis Simulation Dataset**, the citation is:
  > DAI-Labor. *Elvis: Electric Vehicle Charging Infrastructure Simulator*. Available at: https://github.com/dailab/elvis.

- For the **Renewables Ninja Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Renewables Ninja. *Renewables Ninja: Simulated Hourly Power Output from Wind and Solar PV Farms*. Available at: https://www.renewables.ninja/.

- For the **Pecan Street Dataport**, the citation is:
  > Pecan Street. *Pecan Street Dataport: Energy Market Prices*. Available at: https://www.pecanstreet.org/dataport/.

- For the **Low-Voltage Load Forecasting Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Haben, S., Arora, S., Giasemidis, G., Voss, M., & VukadinoviÄ‡ Greetham, D. (2021). *Review of Low Voltage Load Forecasting: Methods, Applications, and Recommendations*. Applied Energy, 304, 117798. doi: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2021.117798.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets in a structured format for clarity and further use.
