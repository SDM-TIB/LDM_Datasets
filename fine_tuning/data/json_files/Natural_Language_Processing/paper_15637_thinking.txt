To extract datasets from the research paper titled "AutoSAM: Towards Automatic Sampling of User Behaviors for Sequential Recommender Systems" by Hao Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on "four real-world datasets from different online platforms," which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention four datasets:

1. **Tmall Dataset**: This dataset contains anonymized users' shopping logs from the Tmall platform over the past six months leading up to the "Double 11" shopping day.

2. **Alipay Dataset**: This dataset includes a large amount of user data from Alibaba Group and Koubei, collected between July 1, 2015, and November 30, 2015.

3. **Yelp Dataset**: A public dataset where user sequential behaviors are derived by ranking rated items in chronological order.

4. **Amazon Book Dataset**: This dataset is constructed from Amazon review data, where sequential behaviors are created using users' rating histories.

In the same section, the authors provide links to the datasets, which I will note for citation purposes. 

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For the **Tmall Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Tmall Dataset. (2023). Retrieved from https://tianchi.aliyun.com/dataset/dataDetail?dataId=42

- For the **Alipay Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Alipay Dataset. (2023). Retrieved from https://tianchi.aliyun.com/dataset/dataDetail?dataId=53

- For the **Yelp Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yelp Dataset. (2023). Retrieved from https://www.yelp.com/dataset

- For the **Amazon Book Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Amazon Book Dataset. (2023). Retrieved from http://deepyeti.ucsd.edu/jianmo/amazon/index.html

With this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described accurately and includes its full citation. This will allow for a structured output that can be used for further analysis or integration into other systems.
