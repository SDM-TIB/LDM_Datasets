To extract datasets from the research paper titled "NUGGET: Neural Agglomerative Embeddings of Text" by Guanghui Qin and Benjamin Van Durme, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors demonstrate NUGGET's effectiveness in tasks involving semantic comparison, which suggests that datasets are likely involved in their experiments.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (specifically section 6) where the authors describe their tasks and datasets in detail. Here, they explicitly mention two datasets used for the document-level semantic similarity test:

1. **PARABANK**: This dataset is derived from a large-scale English paraphrase dataset constructed using a Czech-English neural machine translation system. The authors provide a link to the dataset and mention that it is used for paraphrase identification tasks.

2. **WikiText-103**: This dataset is a collection of Wikipedia articles used for passage reranking tasks. The authors describe how they split the dataset into articles and use sections as passages for their experiments.

In the **appendix A**, the authors provide additional details about the construction of these datasets, confirming their relevance and usage in the experiments.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **PARABANK**, the citation is:
  > Hu, J. E., Rudinger, R., Post, M., and Van Durme, B. *ParaBank: Monolingual Bitext Generation and Sentential Paraphrasing via Lexically-constrained Neural Machine Translation*. In Proceedings of the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI), 2019.

- For **WikiText-103**, the citation is:
  > Merity, S., Xiong, C., Bradbury, J., and Socher, R. *Pointer Sentinel Mixture Models*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR), 2016.

With these citations in hand, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
