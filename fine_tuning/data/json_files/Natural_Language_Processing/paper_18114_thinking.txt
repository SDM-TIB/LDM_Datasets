To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Better Explain Transformers by Illuminating Important Information" by Linxin Song et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluated their method on various classification and question-answering datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed involved. I will look for specific names of these datasets.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (section 5) where the authors detail the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they explicitly list the datasets:

1. **SST-2**: A sentiment classification dataset with 6,920 training examples, 872 validation examples, and 1,821 test examples.
2. **IMDB**: A sentiment classification dataset with 25,000 training examples and 25,000 test examples.
3. **Yelp Polarity**: Another sentiment classification dataset with 560,000 training examples and 38,000 test examples.
4. **QQP**: A dataset for question pairing with 363,846 training examples and 390,965 test examples.
5. **MNLI**: A natural language inference dataset with 392,702 training examples and 20,000 test examples.
6. **SQuADv1**: A question-answering dataset with 87,599 training examples and 9,533 test examples.
7. **SQuADv2**: Another question-answering dataset with 130,319 training examples and 8,862 test examples.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The authors may not provide explicit citations for all datasets, but I can look for the original papers or sources for each dataset mentioned.

For the datasets listed, I will compile the following citations based on the information provided in the paper and known sources:

- **SST-2**:
  > Richard Socher et al. *Recursive Deep Models for Semantic Compositionality over a Sentiment Treebank*. In Proceedings of the 2013 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 1631–1642, 2013.

  > Pranav Rajpurkar et al. *Know What You Don’t Know: Unanswerable Questions for SQuAD*. In Proceedings of the 56th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, pages 784–789, 2018.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets and their citations in a structured format for clarity and future reference. This will ensure that I have accurately captured all relevant datasets from the paper along with their full citations.
