To extract datasets from the research paper titled "COSTA: Code-Switched Speech Translation using Aligned Speech-Text Interleaving" by Bhavani Shankar et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors present a new evaluation benchmark for code-switched speech translation in multiple language pairs, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Dataset Details)**, which is likely to contain comprehensive information about the datasets used in the study. This section is divided into subsections that detail the training data, evaluation sets, and any additional datasets mentioned.

In **subsection 4.1 (Training/Fine-tuning Data)**, the authors mention sourcing 30 hours of ASR data from the **IndicVoices** dataset, which is a significant dataset for their training process. I will note the details provided about this dataset, including its size and the nature of the data.

In **subsection 4.2 (Code-switched Evaluation Sets)**, the authors describe the creation of evaluation sets for Telugu, Hindi, Marathi, and Bengali, extracted from IndicVoices. They provide statistics for each language pair, which confirms the datasets used for evaluation.

Additionally, in **subsection 4.3 (Monolingual Evaluation Sets)**, the authors mention extracting monolingual evaluation sets from IndicVoices for Telugu and Hindi, which further emphasizes the importance of this dataset in their research.

I will also check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The authors reference the IndicVoices dataset and the IndicTrans2 model, which are crucial for understanding the datasets used in their experiments.

The full citation for the **IndicVoices dataset** is:
> Javed, T., Bhogale, K. S., Raman, A., Kumar, P., Kunchukuttan, A., & Khapra, M. M. (2024). IndicVoices: Towards building an inclusive multilingual speech dataset for Indian languages. Preprint, arXiv:2403.01926.

The full citation for the **IndicTrans2 model** is:
> Gala, J., Chitale, P. A., Raghavan, A. K., Gumma, V., Doddapaneni, S., Kumar, A., Nawale, J. A., Sujatha, A., Puduppully, R., Raghavan, V., Kumar, P., Khapra, M. M. (2023). IndicTrans2: Towards high-quality and accessible machine translation models for all 22 scheduled Indian languages. Transactions on Machine Learning Research.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
