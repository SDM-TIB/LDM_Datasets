To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Bilingual Lexicon Induction through Unsupervised Machine Translation" by Mikel Artetxe, Gorka Labaka, and Eneko Agirre, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental settings sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method on the **MUSE dataset**, which suggests that this dataset is crucial for their experiments.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experimental settings section**. Here, the authors clarify that they use the evaluation dictionaries from the **MUSE dataset** for their comparisons. They also mention that they extracted monolingual corpora from Wikipedia to train their own embeddings, but the focus here is on the MUSE dataset.

In the **results and discussion section**, the authors compare their method's performance against previous methods using the MUSE dataset. This reinforces the importance of the MUSE dataset in their evaluation.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citation for the MUSE dataset. The relevant citation is:

- For the **MUSE dataset**, the citation is:
  > Alexis Conneau, Guillaume Lample, Marc’Aurelio Ranzato, Ludovic Denoyer, and Hervé Jégou. *Word translation without parallel data*. In Proceedings of the 6th International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR 2018).

Since the authors do not mention any other datasets explicitly, I will focus solely on the MUSE dataset for my extraction.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry for the MUSE dataset, ensuring that I include the full citation as required. This will be ready for further processing or review.
