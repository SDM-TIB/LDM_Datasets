To extract datasets from the research paper titled "FlowIBR: Leveraging Pre-Training for Efficient Neural Image-Based Rendering of Dynamic Scenes" by Marcel Büschnig et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the use of a "pre-trained rendering backbone based on Generalizable NeRF Transformer (GNT)," which suggests that datasets related to this method may be discussed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental results section** where the authors describe their evaluation setup. In section 4.1, they explicitly state that they used the **Nvidia Dynamic Scenes Dataset** for their experiments. This is a clear indication that this dataset is crucial for their work.

I will then look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the methodology or related work sections. In this case, the authors do not provide a separate datasets section, but they do reference the Nvidia Dynamic Scenes Dataset multiple times throughout the paper, particularly in the context of their experimental setup.

To ensure I have the correct citation for the dataset, I will check the **References section** of the paper. The citation for the Nvidia Dynamic Scenes Dataset is as follows:
> Jae Shin Yoon, Kihwan Kim, Orazio Gallo, Hyun Soo Park, and Jan Kautz. *Novel View Synthesis of Dynamic Scenes With Globally Coherent Depths From a Monocular Camera*. In IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 5335–5344, 2020.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the findings:

1. **Nvidia Dynamic Scenes Dataset**: This dataset is used for evaluating the proposed method, FlowIBR, and is essential for the experiments conducted in the paper.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use, ensuring that each dataset is clearly identified along with its full citation.
