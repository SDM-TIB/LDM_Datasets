To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SliceMamba with Neural Architecture Search for Medical Image Segmentation" by Chao Fan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments on various datasets, which indicates that multiple datasets are likely discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, they mention:

1. **ISIC2017 Dataset**: This dataset is described as containing 2150 images with corresponding lesion segmentation masks.
2. **ISIC2018 Dataset**: This dataset includes 2694 images, also with segmentation masks.
3. **Kvasir Dataset**: An open-source gastrointestinal polyp dataset containing 1000 high-resolution color polyp images.
4. **ClinicDB Dataset**: This dataset has 612 polyp images with manually annotated segmentation masks.
5. **Synapse Dataset**: A multi-organ segmentation dataset containing 30 abdominal CT scans with 3779 axial images.

I will then verify the details of each dataset by checking the **references section** to find the full citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- **ISIC2017 Dataset**:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, which is essential for reproducibility and further research in the field.
