To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Uncertainty-aware Consistency Learning for Cold-Start Item Recommendation" by Chen Gao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors mention the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they explicitly state that they conducted experiments on two benchmark datasets: **Yelp** and **Amazon-Book**. This is a clear indication that these datasets are central to their research.

I will then look for any additional details about these datasets in the text. The authors mention that they followed a 10-core setting for both datasets and split user-item interactions into training, validation, and testing sets. However, they do not provide extensive descriptions of the datasets themselves, which is common in research papers that focus more on methodology and results.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. Since the datasets are widely used benchmarks, I will look for their original sources:

1. **Yelp Dataset**: The citation for the Yelp dataset is typically:
   > Yelp. *Yelp Dataset Challenge*. Retrieved from https://www.yelp.com/dataset/challenge.

2. **Amazon-Book Dataset**: The citation for the Amazon-Book dataset is usually:
   > McAuley, J. J., & Leskovec, J. (2013). *Hidden factors and hidden topics: understanding rating dimensions with review text*. In Proceedings of the 7th ACM Conference on Recommender Systems (RecSys), 2013.

With these citations in hand, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations as required.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for output, ensuring they are structured and ready for any further processing or review.
