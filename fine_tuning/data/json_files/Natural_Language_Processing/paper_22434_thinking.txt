To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Compression-Realized Deep Structural Network for Video Quality Enhancement" by Hanchi Sun et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the experimental results are based on datasets like **LDV 2.0** and **MFQE 2.0**, which indicates that these datasets are crucial for the research.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors describe their methodology and the datasets used. In section 4.1, they explicitly mention that they trained and tested their proposed framework on **LDV 2.0** and **MFQE 2.0**. The LDV 2.0 dataset consists of 270 videos, with 255 for training and 15 for testing, while MFQE 2.0 consists of 126 videos, with 108 for training and 18 for testing. This confirms that both datasets are integral to their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **LDV 2.0**, the citation is:
  > Ren Yang, Radu Timofte, Meisong Zheng, Qunliang Xing, Minglang Qiao, Mai Xu, Lai Jiang, Huaida Liu, Ying Chen, Youcheng Ben, et al. *NTIRE 2022 Challenge on Super-Resolution and Quality Enhancement of Compressed Video: Dataset, Methods and Results*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 1221–1238, 2022.

- For **MFQE 2.0**, the citation is:
  > Zhenyu Guan, Qunliang Xing, Mai Xu, Ren Yang, Tie Liu, and Zulin Wang. *MFQE 2.0: A New Approach for Multi-Frame Quality Enhancement on Compressed Video*. IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 43(3):949–963, 2019.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **LDV 2.0**: A dataset consisting of 270 videos, with 255 used for training and 15 for testing, specifically designed for video quality enhancement tasks.
2. **MFQE 2.0**: A dataset comprising 126 videos, with 108 for training and 18 for testing, aimed at multi-frame quality enhancement on compressed video.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
