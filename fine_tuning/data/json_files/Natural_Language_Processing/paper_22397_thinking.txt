To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Estimating Noisy Class Posterior with Part-level Labels for Noisy Label Learning" by Bin Shi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluated their method on both synthetic and real-world datasets, which indicates that there are datasets involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, they mention several datasets:

1. **MNIST**: A well-known dataset consisting of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images of handwritten digits from 0 to 9.

2. **CIFAR-10**: This dataset contains 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images, representing 10 object classes.

3. **CIFAR-100**: Similar to CIFAR-10, but with 100 object classes, also containing 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images.

4. **Clothing1M**: A large-scale dataset with 1 million clothing images that have noisy labels for training and 10,000 images with clean labels for testing.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **MNIST**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun. The MNIST database of handwritten digits. http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/, 1998.

- For **CIFAR-10** and **CIFAR-100**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky et al. Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images. Technical report, 2009.

- For **Clothing1M**, the citation is:
  > X. Xiao, T. Xia, Y. Yang, C. Huang, and X. Wang. Learning from massive noisy labeled data for image classification. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 2691â€“2699, 2015.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required.

After completing this process, I will have a structured output that includes all the necessary information about the datasets used in the paper, ready for further processing or review.
