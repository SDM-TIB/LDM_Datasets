To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Mamba meets crack segmentation" by Zhili He and Yu-Hsing Wang, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview, and the introduction often discusses the datasets used in the context of the research.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention that they will evaluate their method on two representative and publicly available crack datasets. This indicates that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets**. In this paper, it appears that the datasets are discussed in **section 3.2 (Crack datasets)**. Here, the authors specify two datasets:

1. **Deepcrack**: This dataset consists of 537 crack images with corresponding pixel-level labels. It includes images captured in various pavement scenes, categorized into asphalt and concrete pavements. The training set consists of 300 pairs of images and labels, while the test set has 237 pairs.

2. **Steelcrack**: This dataset contains images of cracks in steel structures, with meticulous manual labels provided for all images. It includes 3300 training images, 525 validation images, and 530 test images, all at a resolution of 512 Ã— 512.

To ensure I have the correct citations, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **Deepcrack**, the citation is:
  > Liu, Y., Yao, J., Lu, X., Xie, R., & Li, L. (2019). DeepCrack: A deep hierarchical feature learning architecture for crack segmentation. *Neurocomputing*, 338, 139-153. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neucom.2019.01.036.

- For **Steelcrack**, the citation is:
  > He, Z., Chen, W., Zhang, J., & Wang, Y.-H. (2024). Crack segmentation on steel structures using boundary guidance model. *Automation in Construction*, 162, 105354. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.autcon.2024.105354.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets along with their full citations, which is crucial for any downstream processing or documentation.
