To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An Adaptive Method for Weak Supervision with Drifting Data" by Alessio Mazzetto et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses an adaptive method for weak supervision and mentions experiments on synthetic and real-world labelers, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will look for specific sections that typically contain dataset information, such as **section 6 (Empirical Evaluation)**, where the authors describe their experimental setup. Here, they mention using the **Animals with Attributes2 (AwA2) dataset** for their experiments. This is a clear indication that I need to extract details about this dataset.

In section 6.2, the authors provide a detailed description of the AwA2 dataset, stating that it consists of images of animals from 50 disjoint classes, split into 40 seen classes for training and 10 unseen classes for testing. They also mention the relations among 85 attributes and how they use this dataset to create a binary classification task with drift.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the AwA2 dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Yongqin Xian, Christoph H Lampert, Bernt Schiele, and Zeynep Akata. *Zero-shot learning—a comprehensive evaluation of the good, the bad and the ugly*. IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 41(9):2251–2265, 2018.

Additionally, I will note that the authors also mention using **synthetic data** in their experiments, but they do not provide a specific citation for this dataset since it is generated for the purpose of the study.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citation for the AwA2 dataset while noting that the synthetic dataset does not have a formal citation.

This structured approach will help ensure that I accurately capture all relevant datasets and their citations from the paper.
