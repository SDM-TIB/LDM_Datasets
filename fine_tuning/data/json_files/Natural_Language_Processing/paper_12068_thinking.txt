To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Information decomposition in complex systems via machine learning" by Kieran A. Murphy and Dani S. Bassett, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, results, and discussion sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions a methodology for analyzing complex systems, which suggests that datasets may be involved, particularly in the context of the examples provided.

Next, I will focus on the **Methods section**, where the authors describe their approach to analyzing complex systems. They mention two paradigmatic examples: a **Boolean circuit** and an **amorphous material undergoing plastic deformation**. I will look for specific datasets related to these examples.

In the **Results section**, the authors detail their analysis of the Boolean circuit and the amorphous material. They describe the datasets used for training and validation, particularly for the amorphous material, where they mention a dataset derived from rearrangement events in simulated glasses. The authors state that the glass dataset is attached to the paper and has also been deposited to Figshare, which indicates that it is publicly accessible.

Now, I will extract the specific datasets mentioned:

1. **Glass Dataset**: This dataset consists of local neighborhoods immediately preceding rearrangement events in simulated glasses. The authors note that it has been deposited on Figshare and is derived from a previous study.

To find the full citation for the glass dataset, I will refer to the **References section**. The relevant citation is:
   > K.A. Murphy, D.S. Bassett. *Regions of simulated glasses for binary classification about imminent rearrangement*. Figshare, https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.24585150.v1 (2023).

Next, I will summarize the findings:

- The **Glass Dataset** is crucial for the analysis of rearrangement events in amorphous materials, and it is publicly available for further research.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and full citation, ensuring that all necessary information is accurately captured for future reference.
