To extract datasets from the research paper titled "When Less is Enough: Positive and Unlabeled Learning Model for Vulnerability Detection" by Xin-Cheng Wen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract highlights that the authors conducted extensive experiments based on real-world vulnerability datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section IV (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for evaluation. They state that three widely-used vulnerability datasets are adopted for their experiments:

1. **FFMPeg+Qemu**: This dataset consists of two open-source C projects with a total of 22,000 samples, out of which 10,000 samples are vulnerable.

2. **Reveal**: This dataset tracks historical vulnerabilities in two open-source projects, containing over 22,000 samples with approximately 2,000 vulnerable samples.

3. **Fan et al.**: This dataset collects 91 types of vulnerabilities from 348 open-source GitHub projects, totaling around 188,000 samples, with 10,000 of them being vulnerable.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

- For **FFMPeg+Qemu**, the citation is:
  > Fan, J., Li, Y., Wang, S., & Nguyen, T. N. (2020). A C/C++ code vulnerability dataset with code changes and CVE summaries. In *MSR ’20: 17th International Conference on Mining Software Repositories* (pp. 508–512). ACM.

- For **Reveal**, the citation is:
  > Chakraborty, S., Krishna, R., Ding, Y., & Ray, B. (2020). Deep learning based vulnerability detection: Are we there yet? CoRR, vol. abs/2009.07235.

- For **Fan et al.**, the citation is:
  > Fan, J., Li, Y., Wang, S., & Nguyen, T. N. (2020). A C/C++ code vulnerability dataset with code changes and CVE summaries. In *MSR ’20: 17th International Conference on Mining Software Repositories* (pp. 508–512). ACM.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations.
