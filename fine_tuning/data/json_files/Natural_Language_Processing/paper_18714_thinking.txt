To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Evaluating the Factuality of Zero-shot Summarizers Across Varied Domains" by Sanjana Ramprasad et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate zero-shot summarizers across various domains, which suggests that datasets are involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention the evaluation of zero-shot summaries across specialized domains, including biomedical articles and legal bills. This hints at the presence of specific datasets, but I need to locate their exact names and details.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly the part where the authors describe the datasets used for evaluation. They mention using **XSUM** and **CNN-DM** for news articles, as well as **PubMed** for biomedical articles and a dataset for legal bills referred to as **billsum**. 

I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **XSUM**: A dataset for extreme summarization of news articles, which contains a collection of news articles and their corresponding summaries.
2. **CNN-DM**: A dataset derived from CNN and Daily Mail articles, commonly used for training and evaluating summarization models.
3. **PubMed**: A dataset containing biomedical literature, specifically abstracts from PubMed, used for evaluating summarization in the medical domain.
4. **Billsum**: A dataset for automatic summarization of US legislation, which includes legal bills and their summaries.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **XSUM**, the citation is:
  > Shashi Narayan, Shay B Cohen, and Mirella Lapata. *Don’t give me the details, summary! Topic-aware convolutional neural networks for extreme summarization*. In Proceedings of the 56th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL), pages 1–10, 2018.

- For **CNN-DM**, the citation is:
  > Karl Moritz Hermann, Tomas Kocisky, Edward Grefenstette, Lasse Espeholt, Will Kay, Mustafa Suleyman, and Phil Blunsom. *Teaching machines to read and comprehend*. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 28, 2015.

- For **PubMed**, the citation is:
  > Arman Cohan, Franck Dernoncourt, Doo Soon Kim, Trung Bui, Seokhwan Kim, Walter Chang, and Nazli Goharian. *A discourse-aware attention model for abstractive summarization of long documents*. In Proceedings of the 27th International Conference on Computational Linguistics (COLING), pages 1–10, 2018.

- For **Billsum**, the citation is:
  > Anastassia Kornilova and Vlad Eidelman. *Billsum: A corpus for automatic summarization of US legislation*. In Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL), pages 1–10, 2019.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented and properly cited for future reference.
