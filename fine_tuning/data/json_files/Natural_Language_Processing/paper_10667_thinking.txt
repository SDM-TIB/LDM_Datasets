To extract datasets from the research paper titled "GRACE: Discriminator-Guided Chain-of-Thought Reasoning" by Muhammad Khalifa et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the experiments conducted, which may include references to specific datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used in their evaluations. In this section, I will look for any specific names of datasets, their descriptions, and any relevant statistics or characteristics that the authors provide.

In the **results section**, the authors may also reference the datasets again, particularly when discussing the performance of their method on these datasets. This will help confirm the datasets identified earlier and provide additional context.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

From the paper, I expect to find the following datasets mentioned:

1. **GSM8K**: A dataset for multi-step reasoning tasks, which is commonly used in evaluating language models.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant datasets from the paper.
