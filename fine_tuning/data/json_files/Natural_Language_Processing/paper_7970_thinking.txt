To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ASK ME ANYTHING: A SIMPLE STRATEGY FOR PROMPTING LANGUAGE MODELS" by Simran Arora et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions and may mention specific datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used in their evaluations. In this section, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, descriptions, and any relevant details about their structure or purpose.

As I read through the paper, I will take note of the following datasets mentioned:

1. **SuperGLUE**: This is a benchmark that includes several datasets for evaluating language understanding models. The specific datasets under SuperGLUE mentioned in the paper include:
   - **BoolQ**: A yes/no question answering dataset over small Wikipedia passages.
   - **CB**: A three-class textual entailment task.
   - **COPA**: A causal reasoning dataset.
   - **MultiRC**: A multi-sentence reading comprehension dataset.
   - **ReCoRD**: A reading comprehension dataset requiring commonsense reasoning.
   - **RTE**: A natural language inference dataset.
   - **WiC**: A word sense disambiguation task.
   - **WSC**: A task requiring reading a sentence with a pronoun and selecting the referent.

2. **ANLI**: This dataset is mentioned as adversarially mined natural language inference from Wikipedia, with three versions (R1, R2, R3).

3. **DBPedia**: An ontology classification dataset with 14 classes.

4. **RealTime QA**: A dynamic question answering dataset that asks questions about current world facts.

5. **SST2**: A movie review binary sentiment classification dataset.

6. **WebQuestions**: A question answering dataset with questions that can be answered using Freebase.

After identifying these datasets, I will then refer to the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets.

The full citations I will look for include:
- For **SuperGLUE** datasets, I will reference the original papers for each dataset.
- For **ANLI**, I will cite the paper by Nie et al. (2020).
- For **DBPedia**, I will cite Zhang et al. (2015).
- For **RealTime QA**, I will cite Kasai et al. (2022).
- For **SST2**, I will cite Socher et al. (2013).
- For **WebQuestions**, I will cite Berant et al. (2013).

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited according to the conventions used in academic writing. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research and their significance in the context of the study.
