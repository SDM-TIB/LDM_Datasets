To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CLIMB: A Benchmark of Clinical Bias in Large Language Models" by Yubo Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract introduces CLIMB as a benchmark for evaluating clinical bias in large language models (LLMs), which suggests that datasets are involved in this evaluation.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (CLIMB)**, where the authors describe the evaluation setup. Here, they mention using the **MIMIC-IV database** for their extrinsic bias evaluation. This is a critical dataset as it contains de-identified Electronic Health Records (EHR) for patients, which is essential for their experiments.

In addition, the authors refer to **CLIBENCH**, which is a dataset used for the diagnosis prediction task. They mention that CLIBENCH contains representative clinical cases induced from the MIMIC-IV database, indicating that it is derived from or related to MIMIC-IV.

I will also check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets:

1. **MIMIC-IV Database**: The citation is:
   > Johnson, A. E. W., Pollard, T. J., Shen, L., Lehman, L. W. C., & Feng, M. (2020). MIMIC-IV: A freely accessible electronic health record dataset. *Scientific Data*, 7(1), 1-13. https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-020-0057-8

2. **CLIBENCH**: The citation is:

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and that the full citations are included. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
