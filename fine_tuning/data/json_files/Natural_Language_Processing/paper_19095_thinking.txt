To extract datasets from the research paper titled "LLM-Enhanced User-Item Interactions: Leveraging Edge Information for Optimized Recommendations" by Xinyuan Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the research focus and any datasets that may be referenced. The abstract mentions evaluating the proposed framework on "real-world datasets," which indicates that specific datasets will be discussed later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments** section. In the **experimental setup** section (4.1), the authors explicitly list seven public recommendation datasets used for their experiments. This is a crucial finding, as it directly identifies the datasets relevant to their research.

The datasets mentioned are:

1. **Amazon (AM)-Beauty dataset**
2. **Amazon (AM)-Toys dataset**
3. **Amazon (AM)-Sports dataset**
4. **Amazon (AM)-Luxury dataset**
5. **Amazon (AM)-Scientific dataset**
6. **Amazon (AM)-Instruments dataset**
7. **Amazon (AM)-Food dataset**

I will now check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The paper cites a reference [20] that corresponds to the datasets used, which is:

- **Julian McAuley and Alex Yang.** 2016. *Addressing complex and subjective product-related queries with customer reviews.* In Proceedings of the 25th International Conference on World Wide Web. 625–635.

This citation pertains to the Amazon datasets mentioned in the paper.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citation for each dataset as required. 

The datasets extracted from the paper are:

1. **Amazon (AM)-Beauty dataset**
   - Citation: Julian McAuley and Alex Yang. 2016. *Addressing complex and subjective product-related queries with customer reviews.* In Proceedings of the 25th International Conference on World Wide Web. 625–635.

2. **Amazon (AM)-Toys dataset**
   - Citation: Julian McAuley and Alex Yang. 2016. *Addressing complex and subjective product-related queries with customer reviews.* In Proceedings of the 25th International Conference on World Wide Web. 625–635.

3. **Amazon (AM)-Sports dataset**
   - Citation: Julian McAuley and Alex Yang. 2016. *Addressing complex and subjective product-related queries with customer reviews.* In Proceedings of the 25th International Conference on World Wide Web. 625–635.

4. **Amazon (AM)-Luxury dataset**
   - Citation: Julian McAuley and Alex Yang. 2016. *Addressing complex and subjective product-related queries with customer reviews.* In Proceedings of the 25th International Conference on World Wide Web. 625–635.

5. **Amazon (AM)-Scientific dataset**
   - Citation: Julian McAuley and Alex Yang. 2016. *Addressing complex and subjective product-related queries with customer reviews.* In Proceedings of the 25th International Conference on World Wide Web. 625–635.

6. **Amazon (AM)-Instruments dataset**
   - Citation: Julian McAuley and Alex Yang. 2016. *Addressing complex and subjective product-related queries with customer reviews.* In Proceedings of the 25th International Conference on World Wide Web. 625–635.

7. **Amazon (AM)-Food dataset**
   - Citation: Julian McAuley and Alex Yang. 2016. *Addressing complex and subjective product-related queries with customer reviews.* In Proceedings of the 25th International Conference on World Wide Web. 625–635.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for further processing or review.
