To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Time-SSM: Simplifying and Unifying State Space Models for Time Series Forecasting" by Jiaxi Hu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to locate any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for validation or comparison. The introduction often discusses the context of the research and may highlight specific datasets relevant to the study.

Next, I will focus on the **Experiments section**, which typically contains detailed information about the datasets used in the study. In this section, the authors usually describe the datasets, including their characteristics, dimensions, and any relevant details about how they were utilized in the experiments.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention several datasets in the **C.1 Datasets** subsection. The datasets listed are:

1. **ETTm1**: This dataset contains 7 factors of electricity transformer data recorded every 15 minutes from July 2016 to July 2018. The dataset size is (34369, 11425, 11425) with forecasting lengths of {96, 192, 336, 720}.

2. **ETTh1**: Similar to ETTm1, this dataset also contains 7 factors of electricity transformer data but recorded hourly. The dataset size is (8445, 2785, 2785) with the same forecasting lengths.

3. **ETTm2**: Another electricity transformer dataset with 7 factors, recorded every 15 minutes. The dataset size is (34369, 11425, 11425) with the same forecasting lengths.

4. **ETTh2**: This dataset contains 7 factors of electricity transformer data recorded hourly. The dataset size is (8545, 2881, 2881) with the same forecasting lengths.

5. **Exchange**: This dataset includes panel data of daily exchange rates from 8 countries from 1990 to 2016. The dataset size is (5120, 665, 1422) with the same forecasting lengths.

6. **Crypto**: This dataset comprises historical transaction data for various cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin and Ethereum. The dataset size is (125699, 17891, 35873) with the same forecasting lengths.

7. **Weather**: This dataset includes 21 meteorological factors collected every 10 minutes from the Weather Station of the Max Planck Bio-geochemistry Institute in 2020. The dataset size is (36696, 5175, 10440) with the same forecasting lengths.

8. **Air Convection**: This dataset includes data for the entire year of 2023, consisting of 10 variables such as air humidity and pressure, sampled at intervals of 15 minutes. The dataset size is (14647, 4882, 4882) with the same forecasting lengths.

Now, I will look for the full citations for these datasets in the **References section** of the paper. However, since the datasets are likely to be publicly available or derived from existing studies, I will provide the citations based on the information given in the paper and any known sources.

For the datasets, the citations are as follows:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use.
