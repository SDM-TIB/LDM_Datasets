To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Topic-switch adapted Japanese Dialogue System based on PLATO-2" by Donghuo Zeng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors created a large-scale Japanese dialogue dataset called **Dialogue-Graph**, which is a strong indication that this is the primary dataset of interest.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Dataset)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the **Dialogue-Graph** dataset. Here, they describe how the dataset was collected, its structure, and the number of dialogue instances it contains. Specifically, they mention that it consists of **1.656 million dialogue data** in a tree structure sourced from News, TV subtitles, and Wikipedia corpus.

In **section 3.1 (Data collection)**, the authors elaborate on the methodology used to collect the dataset, including the crowd-driven system and the participant recruitment process. This section confirms the dataset's significance and provides context for its creation.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the **Dialogue-Graph** dataset. However, since this dataset is created by the authors themselves, it may not have an external citation. Instead, I will note the authors and the context in which the dataset was created.

The citation for the dataset will be:
> Zeng, D., Wu, J., Wang, Y., Ikeda, K., Matsumoto, K., & Hattori, G. (2023). *Topic-switch adapted Japanese Dialogue System based on PLATO-2*. In Proceedings of the [Conference Name], [Location], [Date]. KDDI Research, Inc.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and citation. This will allow for easy reference and use in future research or applications.

In summary, the key steps I took were:
1. Read the abstract and introduction to identify the dataset.
2. Review section 3 for detailed information about the dataset.
3. Note the methodology and context of dataset creation.
4. Prepare the citation based on the authors and the paper details.

With this approach, I can ensure that I accurately capture the necessary details about the dataset from the research paper.
