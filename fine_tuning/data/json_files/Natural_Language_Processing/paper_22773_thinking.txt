To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Influence based explainability of brain tumors segmentation in multimodal Magnetic Resonance Imaging" by Tommaso Torda et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract discusses the application of an influence-based explainability algorithm in the context of brain tumor segmentation, which suggests that datasets related to medical imaging are likely involved.

Next, I will focus on the **Materials and Methods section**, specifically section 3.1, where the authors describe the image database. Here, they mention the **BraTS19 dataset**, which is a key dataset used for their experiments. I will take note of the details provided about this dataset, including its composition and the types of MRI scans included.

In section 3.1, the authors provide a comprehensive description of the BraTS19 dataset, stating that it consists of 259 cases of high-grade gliomas (HGG) and 76 cases of low-grade gliomas (LGG), with MRI scans taken in four different modalities. This information is crucial for understanding the dataset's structure and purpose.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the BraTS19 dataset. The relevant citation is:

- For **BraTS19 dataset**:

Advancing The Cancer Genome Atlas glioma MRI collections with expert segmentation labels and radiomic features. *Scientific Data*, 4, 170117. https://doi.org/10.1038/sdata.2017.117

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry for the BraTS19 dataset, ensuring that I include all relevant details and the full citation.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry in the required format, ready for further processing or review.
