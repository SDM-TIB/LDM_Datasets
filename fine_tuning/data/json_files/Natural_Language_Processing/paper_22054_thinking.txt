To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Analyzing Semantic Change through Lexical Replacements" by Francesco Periti et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on lexical replacements and semantic change, which may hint at the datasets used.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any references to datasets. The authors discuss their contributions and the context of their research, which may include mentions of specific datasets or benchmarks relevant to their work.

In the **methodology section**, the authors describe their experimental setup and the data they used. Here, they mention the **SemCor dataset**, which is a significant dataset for their experiments. I will note the details provided about this dataset, including its purpose and how it was utilized in their research.

The paper also references an **artificial diachronic corpus** created for the study, which is another dataset I need to document. I will look for any specific details about how this corpus was generated and its relevance to the experiments conducted.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets themselves.

For the **SemCor dataset**, the citation is:
> Miller, G. A., Leacock, C., Tengi, R., & Bunker, R. T. (1993). *A Semantic Concordance*. In Human Language Technology: Proceedings of a Workshop Held at Plainsboro, New Jersey, March 21-24, 1993.

For the **artificial diachronic corpus**, since it is generated from existing datasets and does not have a standalone citation, I will note that it is based on the **SemEval and LSCDiscovery benchmarks**. I will also look for any specific references to these benchmarks in the references section.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
