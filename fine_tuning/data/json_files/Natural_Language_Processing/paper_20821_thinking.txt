To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Intrinsic Subgraph Generation for Interpretable Graph based Visual Question Answering" by Pascal Tilli and Ngoc Thang Vu, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors demonstrate competitive performance on the **GQA dataset**, which indicates that this dataset is likely central to their research.

Next, I will examine the **related work section** to see if any other datasets are referenced. The authors mention various datasets in the context of visual question answering, including **Visual Genome** and **CLEVR**, but I need to confirm if these datasets are used in their experiments or just referenced for context.

In the **experimental setup and results section**, I will look for explicit mentions of datasets used for training or evaluation. The authors specifically state that they conduct experiments on the **GQA dataset**, which is confirmed multiple times throughout the paper. They also reference **Visual Genome** as a source for scene graphs but do not indicate that they use it directly in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **references section** to gather full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. **GQA Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Hudson, D., & Manning, C. D. (2019). GQA: A new dataset for real-world visual reasoning and compositional question answering. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 6700–6709.

2. **Visual Genome**: The citation is:
   > Krishna, R., Zhu, Y., Groth, O., Johnson, J., Hata, K., Kravitz, J., Chen, S., Kalantidis, Y., Li, L.-J., Shamma, D. A., et al. (2017). Visual Genome: Connecting language and vision using crowdsourced dense image annotations. International Journal of Computer Vision, 123(1):32–73.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
