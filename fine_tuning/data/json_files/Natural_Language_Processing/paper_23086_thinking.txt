To extract datasets from the research paper titled "FedSAC: Dynamic Submodel Allocation for Collaborative Fairness in Federated Learning" by Zheng Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that extensive experiments were conducted on three public benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved. I will note this as a starting point.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (Section 5) where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they refer to three datasets:

1. **CIFAR10**: A well-known dataset for image classification tasks, consisting of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class.
2. **SVHN (Street View House Numbers)**: A real-world image dataset for digit recognition, containing over 600,000 labeled digits.
3. **Fashion MNIST**: A dataset of Zalando's article images, consisting of 70,000 grayscale images in 10 categories.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **CIFAR10**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton, et al. 2009. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. Master’s thesis, Department of Computer Science, University of Toronto.

- For **SVHN**, the citation is:
  > Yuval Netzer, Tao Wang, Adam Coates, Alessandro Bissacco, Bo Wu, and Andrew Y Ng. 2011. *Reading digits in natural images with unsupervised feature learning*. In NIPS Workshop on Deep Learning and Unsupervised Feature Learning 2011.

- For **Fashion MNIST**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun, Léon Bottou, Yoshua Bengio, and Patrick Haffner. 1998. *Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition*. Proc. IEEE 86, 11 (1998), 2278–2324.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use.

In summary, I will ensure that I have accurately captured the names of the datasets, their descriptions, and their full citations, which are crucial for proper referencing in any subsequent analysis or application of this research.
