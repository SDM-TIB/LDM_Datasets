To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Bilingual Alignment Pre-Training for Zero-Shot Cross-Lingual Transfer" by Ziqing Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their model on two tasks: **MLQA** and **XNLI**, which suggests that these may be datasets used in their experiments.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (section 3) closely, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In section 3.1, the authors mention that they applied their model to the **MLQA** and **XNLI** tasks. I will look for specific details about these datasets, such as their characteristics and any relevant statistics.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide results for both MLQA and XNLI, but they do not provide extensive details about the datasets themselves. Therefore, I will need to refer to the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets.

For the **MLQA dataset**, the citation is:
> Lewis, P., OÄŸuz, B., Rinott, R., Riedel, S., & Schwenk, H. (2019). *MLQA: Evaluating cross-lingual extractive question answering*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1910.07475.

For the **XNLI dataset**, the citation is:
> Conneau, A., Rinott, R., Lample, G., Williams, A., Bowman, S., Schwenk, H., & Stoyanov, V. (2018). *XNLI: Evaluating cross-lingual sentence representations*. In Proceedings of the 2018 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (pp. 2475-2485).

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. This includes ensuring that I have accurately captured the names, descriptions, and citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper.
