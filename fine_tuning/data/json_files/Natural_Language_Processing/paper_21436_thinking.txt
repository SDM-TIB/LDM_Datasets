To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fine-Grained Side Information Guided Dual-Prompts for Zero-Shot Skeleton Action Recognition" by Yang Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. In the abstract, the authors mention achieving state-of-the-art performance on several datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention three datasets:

1. **NTU RGB+D 60 Dataset**: This dataset contains 56,880 action samples across 60 action categories, with multi-modalities including RGB, depth, skeleton, and infrared video. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Shahroudy, A., Liu, J., Ng, T.-T., & Wang, G. (2016). NTU RGB+D: A large scale dataset for 3D human activity analysis. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pp. 1010–1019.

2. **NTU RGB+D 120 Dataset**: An extension of the NTU RGB+D 60 dataset, it contains 114,480 action samples across 120 action categories. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Liu, J., Shahroudy, A., Perez, M., Wang, G., Duan, L.-Y., & Kot, A. C. (2019). NTU RGB+D 120: A large-scale benchmark for 3D human activity understanding. IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 42(10), 2684–2701.

3. **PKU-MMD Dataset**: This dataset includes two phases for action recognition and covers 51 action categories with nearly 20,000 instances. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Chunhui, L., Yueyu, H., Yanghao, L., Sijie, S., & Jiaying, L. (2017). PKU-MMD: A large scale benchmark for continuous multi-modal human action understanding. arXiv preprint arXiv:1703.07475.

After identifying these datasets and their citations, I will ensure that I have accurately noted the details and citations for each dataset.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation.
