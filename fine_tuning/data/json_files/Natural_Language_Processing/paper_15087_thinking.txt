To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Inference for Nonlinear Endogenous Treatment Effects Accounting for High-Dimensional Covariate Complexity" by Qingliang Fan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

1. **Read the Abstract and Introduction**: I will start by examining the abstract and introduction sections to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract often summarizes the key findings and may reference datasets used in the study.

2. **Identify Sections Related to Data**: Next, I will look for sections that typically contain information about datasets, such as "Data," "Datasets," or "Empirical Analysis." In this paper, I will specifically look for sections that discuss the empirical study of air pollution and migration, as this is likely to contain relevant datasets.

3. **Locate Specific Datasets**: In the relevant sections, I will look for specific names of datasets, descriptions of their contents, and any details about how they were collected or used in the analysis. For example, the paper mentions using data from the China population census and pollution data from WUSTL surface PM2.5 data.

4. **Extract Full Citations**: After identifying the datasets, I will check the references section of the paper to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

5. **Document Each Dataset**: For each dataset identified, I will document the following information:
   - **Name of the Dataset**: The title or name of the dataset.
   - **Description**: A brief description of what the dataset contains and its relevance to the study.
   - **Citation**: The full citation for the dataset, including authors, title, publication venue, and year.

6. **Compile the Information**: Finally, I will compile all the extracted information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly documented with its name, description, and citation.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets used in the research paper, providing a clear reference for future researchers.
