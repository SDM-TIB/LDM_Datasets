To extract datasets from the research paper titled "UltraLight VM-UNet: Parallel Vision Mamba Significantly Reduces Parameters for Skin Lesion Segmentation" by Renkai Wu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors conducted experiments on **three skin lesion public datasets**, which indicates that datasets are indeed involved.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of these datasets in the **introduction**. The authors mention that their model was validated on three publicly available dermatologic lesion datasets, which suggests that these datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

In the **methods section**, I will specifically check for a subsection that discusses the datasets used for the experiments. Here, the authors provide details about the datasets:

1. **ISIC2017 Dataset**: This dataset consists of 2000 images, which includes dermatoscope images with segmentation mask labels. The dataset is divided into training, validation, and testing sets.

2. **ISIC2018 Dataset**: This dataset contains 2594 images, also with dermatoscope images and segmentation mask labels, and is similarly divided into training, validation, and testing sets.

3. **PH2 Dataset**: This is a smaller dataset with 200 images, used for external validation, also containing dermatoscope images and segmentation mask labels.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **ISIC2017 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Codella, N. C. F., et al. (2018). Skin lesion analysis toward melanoma detection: A challenge at the 2017 international symposium on biomedical imaging (ISBI), hosted by the international skin imaging collaboration (ISIC). In *2018 IEEE 15th International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI)*, pages 168–172. IEEE.

- For the **ISIC2018 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Codella, N. C. F., et al. (2019). Skin lesion analysis toward melanoma detection 2018: A challenge hosted by the international skin imaging collaboration (ISIC). *arXiv preprint arXiv:1902.03368*.

- For the **PH2 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Mendonça, T., et al. (2013). PH2 - A dermoscopic image database for research and benchmarking. In *2013 35th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)*, pages 5437–5440. IEEE.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all details are accurately represented for future reference or processing.
