To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Making Users Indistinguishable: Attribute-wise Unlearning in Recommender Systems" by Chaochao Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental settings sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on three real-world datasets, which suggests that these datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, specifically **subsection 4.1 (Experimental Settings)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention three datasets:

1. **MovieLens 100K (ML-100K)**: This dataset contains user ratings for movies and includes user attributes such as gender, age, and occupation. The authors note that it is one of the most widely used datasets in recommendation systems.

2. **MovieLens 1M (ML-1M)**: This is a larger version of the MovieLens dataset, containing 1 million ratings, and also includes user attributes.

3. **LFM-2B**: This dataset consists of over 2 billion listening events used for music retrieval and recommendation tasks, and it includes user attributes such as gender, age, and country.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

- For **MovieLens 100K**, the citation is:
  > F. Maxwell Harper and Joseph A. Konstan. *The MovieLens Datasets: History and Context*. ACM Transactions on Interactive Intelligent Systems (TIIS), 5(4):1–19, 2015.

- For **MovieLens 1M**, the citation is:
  > F. Maxwell Harper and Joseph A. Konstan. *The MovieLens Datasets: History and Context*. ACM Transactions on Interactive Intelligent Systems (TIIS), 5(4):1–19, 2015.

- For **LFM-2B**, the citation is:
  > Alessandro B Melchiorre, Navid Rekabsaz, Emilia Parada-Cabaleiro, Stefan Brandl, Oleg Lesota, and Markus Schedl. *Investigating Gender Fairness of Recommendation Algorithms in the Music Domain*. Information Processing & Management, 58(5):102666, 2021.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details and that the citations are accurate and complete.
