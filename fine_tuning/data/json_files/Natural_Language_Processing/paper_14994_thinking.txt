To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Evaluating Robustness of Visual Representations for Object Assembly Task Requiring Spatio-Geometrical Reasoning" by Chahyon Ku et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the peg-in-hole assembly task and the challenges associated with it. They mention a novel geometric-peg-in-hole task designed to evaluate spatio-geometric reasoning capabilities, which suggests that a dataset may be involved, but I need to find specific details.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors describe the creation of 3D models of nine peg and hole object pairs, which indicates that they have generated a dataset for their experiments. 

The paper states that they generated 3D models using Blender, which implies that the dataset consists of these models. However, I need to confirm if there are any specific datasets referenced or if they are using existing datasets.

I will also check the **references section** for any citations related to datasets. The authors mention using various pretrained models and refer to datasets like Ego4D and Epic Kitchens, which are significant in the context of visual representations for robotics.

Now, I will compile the information I have gathered:

1. **Geometric-Peg-in-Hole Dataset**: This dataset consists of 3D models of nine peg and hole object pairs created for the purpose of evaluating spatio-geometric reasoning in robotic manipulation tasks. The models were generated using Blender.

2. **Ego4D Dataset**: This dataset is referenced as a source for pretraining visual representations. It contains a large collection of egocentric videos, which are crucial for training models in robotics.

3. **Epic Kitchens Dataset**: Similar to Ego4D, this dataset is mentioned as a source for pretraining visual representations and consists of videos captured in kitchen environments.

Next, I will retrieve the full citations for these datasets from the references section:

- For the **Ego4D Dataset**, the citation is:
  > K. Grauman et al., "Ego4D: Around the world in 3,000 hours of egocentric video," in Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2022, pp. 18 995â€“19 012.

- For the **Epic Kitchens Dataset**, the citation is:
  > A. D. R. et al., "The Epic Kitchens Dataset: A Large-Scale Dataset for Egocentric Video Understanding," in Proceedings of the European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), 2018.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will prepare to format this information according to the required structure for downstream processing.
