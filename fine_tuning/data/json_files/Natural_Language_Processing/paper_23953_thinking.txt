To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Robust Compressive Tracking via Online Weighted Multiple Instance Learning" by Sandeep Singh Sengar, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to find any references to datasets. The abstract mentions "challenging benchmark datasets," which indicates that datasets are used, but I need to find their specific names.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experimental results and analysis)**, where the author discusses the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the author explicitly mentions two benchmark datasets:

1. **Object Tracking Benchmark (OTB)**: This dataset contains 100 fully annotated video sequences designed for evaluating tracking algorithms. It includes various challenging attributes such as background clutter, deformation, fast motion, illumination variation, and occlusion.

2. **Visual Object Tracking (VOT)**: This dataset consists of 60 video sequences with complex environments, also fully annotated for tracking evaluation. It is designed to measure the performance of tracking algorithms under various conditions.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **Object Tracking Benchmark (OTB)**, the citation is:
  > Wu, Y., Lim, J., & Yang, M.-H. (2015). Object tracking benchmark. *IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence*, 37(9), 1834–1848. doi:10.1109/TPAMI.2015.2439280.

- For the **Visual Object Tracking (VOT)**, the citation is:
  > Kristan, M., Matas, J., Leonardis, A., Felsberg, M., Cehovin, L., Fernández, G., ... & Pflugfelder, R. (2015). The visual object tracking vot2015 challenge results. In *Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision Workshops* (pp. 1–23).

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will prepare to compile this information into a structured format for further use or analysis.
