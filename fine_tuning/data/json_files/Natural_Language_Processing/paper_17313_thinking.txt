To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On the Role of Server Momentum in Federated Learning" by Jianhui Sun et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

1. **Initial Reading**: I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract may provide a brief overview of the experiments conducted, which often includes dataset names.

2. **Identifying Sections**: Next, I will look for specific sections that typically contain dataset information, such as **Section 4 (Experiments)** or any section explicitly labeled as **Datasets**. These sections usually provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the experiments.

3. **Extracting Dataset Information**: In the relevant sections, I will look for:
   - The names of the datasets.
   - Descriptions of the datasets, including their size, type, and any specific characteristics (e.g., whether they are balanced or imbalanced).
   - Any references to prior works or papers that describe these datasets, as these will be necessary for proper citation.

4. **Cross-Referencing Citations**: After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for ensuring that I have the correct and complete citation information.

5. **Compiling Dataset Entries**: For each dataset, I will compile the following information:
   - **Name**: The official name of the dataset.
   - **Description**: A brief description of the dataset, including its purpose and any relevant details.
   - **Citation**: The full citation for the dataset as found in the References section.

6. **Final Review**: I will review all extracted information to ensure accuracy and completeness, making sure that all datasets mentioned in the paper are accounted for and properly cited.

By following these steps, I will be able to extract and document the datasets used in the research paper effectively, ensuring that I have all necessary details for future reference or analysis.
