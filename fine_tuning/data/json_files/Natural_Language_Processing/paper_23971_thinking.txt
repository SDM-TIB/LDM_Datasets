To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Lightning-Fast Thunderstorm Warnings: Predicting Severe Convective Environments with Global Neural Weather Models" by Monika Feldmann et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and data sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions evaluating three neural weather models (Pangu-Weather, GraphCast, and FourCastNet) against the ERA-5 reanalysis and the IFS operational numerical weather prediction model. This indicates that these models are likely based on specific datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **Data section** (Section 2), where the authors explicitly state that they are using data from the benchmark dataset "Weatherbench2" for the models Pangu-Weather, GraphCast, and IFS. This is a crucial dataset that needs to be documented.

In addition, the authors mention the **ERA-5 reanalysis** as a ground truth for their evaluations. I will ensure to include this dataset as well.

I will also check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets:

1. **Weatherbench2**: The citation for this dataset is:
   > Rasp, S., Hoyer, S., Merose, A., Langmore, I., Battaglia, P., Russel, T., Sanchez-Gonzalez, A., Yang, V., Carver, R., Agrawal, S., Chantry, M., Bouallegue, Z. B., Dueben, P., Bromberg, C., Sisk, J., Barrington, L., Bell, A., and Sha, F. (2024). Weatherbench 2: A benchmark for the next generation of data-driven global weather models.

2. **ERA-5 Reanalysis**: The citation for this dataset is:
   > Hersbach, H., Bell, B., Berrisford, P., Hirahara, S., Horányi, A., Muñoz-Sabater, J., Nicolas, J., Peubey, C., Radu, R., Schepers, D., Simmons, A., Soci, C., Abdalla, S., Abellan, X., Balsamo, G., Bechtold, P., Biavati, G., Bidlot, J., Bonavita, M., De Chiara, G., Dahlgren, P., Dee, D., Diamantakis, M., Dragani, R., Flemming, J., Forbes, R., Fuentes, M., Geer, A., Haimberger, L., Healy, S., Hogan, R. J., Holm, E., Janisková, M., Keeley, S., Laloyaux, P., Lopez, P., Lupu, C., Radnoti, G., de Rosnay, P., Rozum, I., Vamborg, F., Villaume, S., and Thépaut, J.-N. (2020). The ERA5 global reanalysis. Quarterly Journal of the Royal Meteorological Society, 146(730):1999–2049.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
