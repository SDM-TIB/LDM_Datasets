To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Refining Segmentation On-the-Fly: An Interactive Framework for Point Cloud Semantic Segmentation" by Peng Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. In the abstract, the authors mention evaluating their framework on the **S3DIS** and **ScanNet** datasets, which indicates that these are the datasets of interest.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (specifically section 4) where the authors discuss the datasets in detail. In section 4.1, they explicitly mention:

1. **S3DIS Dataset**: This dataset consists of 6 areas with 272 scenes and 13 categories. The authors specify that they use scenes from Area 5 for interactive segmentation.

2. **ScanNet Dataset**: This dataset contains 1513 scenes and covers 20 semantic categories. The authors follow a specific strategy for train-test splitting as referenced in their methodology.

To confirm the details and obtain full citations, I will check the **References section** of the paper. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **S3DIS Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Armeni, I., Sener, O., Zamir, A.R., Jiang, H., Brilakis, I., Fischer, M., Savarese, S. (2016). *3D Semantic Parsing of Large-Scale Indoor Spaces*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2016.

- For the **ScanNet Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Dai, A., Chang, A.X., Savva, M., Halber, M., Funkhouser, T., Nie√üner, M. (2017). *ScanNet: Richly-Annotated 3D Reconstructions of Indoor Scenes*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2017.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
