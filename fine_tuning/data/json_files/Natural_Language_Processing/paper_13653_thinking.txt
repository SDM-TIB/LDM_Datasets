To extract datasets from the research paper titled "PRISTA-Net: Deep Iterative Shrinkage Thresholding Network for Coded Diffraction Patterns Phase Retrieval" by Aoxu Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions experiments on **Coded Diffraction Patterns (CDPs)**, which indicates that this is a dataset used in their research.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this section, the authors describe their training setup, which includes a training set consisting of **6,000 images from BSD400 and PASCAL VOC**. This is a clear indication that these two datasets are utilized in their experiments.

I will also check the **methodology section** for any additional details about how these datasets are used. The authors mention generating CDPs from the images in the training set, which reinforces the importance of these datasets in their research.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. For the **BSD400 dataset**, the citation is:
   > D. Martin, C. Fowlkes, D. Tal, and J. Malik. "A database of human segmented natural images and its application to evaluating segmentation algorithms and measuring ecological statistics." In Proceedings Eighth IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision. ICCV 2001, vol. 2, pp. 416–423, 2001.

2. For the **PASCAL VOC dataset**, the citation is:
   > M. Everingham, S. M. Eslami, L. Gool, C. K. Williams, J. Winn, and A. Zisserman. "The pascal visual object classes challenge: A retrospective." International Journal of Computer Vision, vol. 111, no. 1, pp. 98–136, Jan 2015.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all necessary details are included for future reference or processing.
