To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Localizing uniformly moving mono-frequent sources using an inverse 2.5D approach" by Christian H. Kasess et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any references to datasets used for validation or testing.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly any subsections that discuss the experimental setup or simulations. This section often contains detailed information about the datasets used, including their characteristics and how they were generated or collected. I will pay attention to any references to simulated data or real-world datasets.

In the **results section**, I will look for any mentions of datasets used to validate the proposed method. The authors may describe the performance of their algorithm using specific datasets, which will be crucial for my extraction.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is important for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets if needed.

For this paper, I anticipate that the authors may have used simulated datasets for their experiments, particularly since they mention "simulated data of a moving point source." I will look for specific details about the simulation parameters, such as the frequency of the source, the speed of the source, and the arrangement of the microphone array.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, I will compile the findings into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required.

In summary, my steps will be:
1. Read the abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections for mentions of datasets.
2. Focus on the methods section for details about experimental setups and datasets.
3. Check the results section for validation of the proposed method using specific datasets.
4. Retrieve full citations from the references section for each identified dataset.
5. Compile the information into a structured format with full citations.

By following these steps, I will ensure a thorough extraction of datasets from the paper while maintaining proper academic standards for citation.
