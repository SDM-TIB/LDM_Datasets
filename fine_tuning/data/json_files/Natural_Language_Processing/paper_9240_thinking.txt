To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Transformer-based Models for Long-Form Document Matching: Challenges and Empirical Analysis" by Akshita Jha et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and datasets sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of "three different kinds of semi-structured long document datasets in English," which indicates that datasets are indeed discussed.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section** to gather context about the datasets. The authors mention the importance of matching long documents and refer to the datasets used for their experiments. This section will help me understand the purpose of the datasets in relation to the research.

I will then navigate to the **datasets section** (which is likely labeled as such) to find explicit mentions of the datasets. In this paper, the authors list three datasets:

1. **ACL Anthology Network Corpus (AAN)**: This dataset consists of 23,766 papers written by 18,862 authors in 373 venues related to NLP. It forms a citation network where similar papers are connected.

2. **Wikipedia Articles (WIKI)**: This dataset is created from a Wikipedia dump containing 6 million articles. The authors describe their methodology for selecting similar articles based on outgoing links.

3. **USPTO Patents (PAT)**: This dataset consists of patents from the USPTO, categorized into four different technology areas. The authors explain how they curated this dataset and the labeling process for similarity.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations I will extract are:

- For **ACL Anthology Network Corpus (AAN)**:
  > Radev, D. R., Muthukrishnan, P., Qazvinian, V., & Abu-Jbara, A. (2013). The ACL Anthology Network Corpus. *Language Resources and Evaluation*, 47(4), 1-26.

- For **Wikipedia Articles (WIKI)**:
  > Wikimedia Foundation. (2023). Wikipedia Dumps. Retrieved from https://dumps.wikimedia.org/enwiki/latest/enwiki-latest-pages-articles.xml.bz2

- For **USPTO Patents (PAT)**:
  > Google. (2023). Patents Public Data. Retrieved from https://github.com/google/patents-public-data

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
