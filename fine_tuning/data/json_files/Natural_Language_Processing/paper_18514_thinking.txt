To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Graph-Mamba: Towards Long-Range Graph Sequence Modeling with Selective State Spaces" by Chloe Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that extensive experiments were conducted on ten benchmark datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the datasets are described in **Appendix A**, where the authors summarize the characteristics and associated prediction tasks for each dataset.

In **Appendix A**, I will find the following datasets:

1. **Peptides-func**: This dataset involves graph-level classification with 10 functional labels. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Dwivedi, V. P., Rampásek, L., Galkin, M., Luu, A. T., Wolf, G., and Beaini, D. *Long range graph benchmark*. Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 35:22326–22340, 2022.

2. **Peptides-struct**: This dataset focuses on graph-level regression, predicting 11 structural properties of the molecules. The citation is the same as above.

3. **PascalVOC-SP**: This dataset is a graph representation of the Pascal VOC dataset for node-level classification tasks. The citation is:
   > Dwivedi, V. P., Rampásek, L., Galkin, M., Luu, A. T., Wolf, G., and Beaini, D. *Long range graph benchmark*. Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 35:22326–22340, 2022.

4. **COCO-SP**: Similar to PascalVOC-SP, this dataset is also for node-level classification tasks. The citation remains the same.

5. **MalNet-Tiny**: This dataset consists of function call graphs extracted from Android APKs, containing 5 classification labels. The citation is:
   > Freitas, S., Dong, Y., Neil, J., and Chau, D. H. *A large-scale database for graph representation learning*. 2021.

6. **PCQM-Contact**: This dataset introduces a link prediction task based on 3D molecular structures. The citation is:
   > Dwivedi, V. P., Rampásek, L., Galkin, M., Luu, A. T., Wolf, G., and Beaini, D. *Long range graph benchmark*. Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 35:22326–22340, 2022.

7. **CIFAR10**: The graph equivalent of the CIFAR10 image classification dataset. The citation is:
   > Dwivedi, V. P., Rampásek, L., Galkin, M., Luu, A. T., Wolf, G., and Beaini, D. *Long range graph benchmark*. Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 35:22326–22340, 2022.

8. **MNIST**: The graph equivalent of the MNIST image classification dataset. The citation is the same as above.

9. **CLUSTER**: A synthetic graph dataset of community structures. The citation is:
   > Dwivedi, V. P., Rampásek, L., Galkin, M., Luu, A. T., Wolf, G., and Beaini, D. *Long range graph benchmark*. Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 35:22326–22340, 2022.

10. **PATTERN**: Another synthetic graph dataset of community structures. The citation is the same as above.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. Each dataset will be clearly described along with its full citation to ensure proper attribution.
