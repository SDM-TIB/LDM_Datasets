To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Jurassic is (almost) All You Need: Few-Shot Meaning-to-Text Generation for Open-Domain Dialogue" by Lena Reed et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and datasets sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the experiments conducted, indicating that two datasets are used for prompt-based learning in the Athena dialogue system.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used:

1. **Athena-KG-Synthetic**: This dataset is created from knowledge graph triples and is used for the domains of music, movies, sports, and TV. The authors mention that it consists of approximately 32,000 training instances, 3,558 development instances, and a test set of 100 instances for each template category.

2. **Viggo Dataset**: This dataset is a parallel corpus that combines responses generated from templates with those generated from meaning representations. The authors state that it includes training, development, and test sets, with each instance using one of Viggo's nine dialogue acts.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **Athena-KG-Synthetic**, the citation is not explicitly provided in the references, but it is derived from the work on knowledge graphs and dialogue systems. I will note that it is a synthetic dataset created for this specific research.

- For **Viggo Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Juraj Juraska, Kevin K Bowden, and Marilyn Walker. *ViGGO: A video game corpus for data-to-text generation in open-domain conversation*. In Proc. of the 12th International Conference on Natural Language Generation, 2019.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations as required. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
