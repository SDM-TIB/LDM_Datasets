To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Computational analyses of linguistic features with schizophrenic and autistic traits along with formal thought disorders" by Takeshi Saga et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the collection of a Japanese audio-report dataset with score labels related to Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and Schizotypal Personality Disorder (SPD). This indicates that a dataset is indeed present, and I need to find more details about it.

Next, I will examine **section 2 (Dataset)**, where the authors describe the data collection process. They mention that they collected an audio-report dataset with schizotypal and autistic personality scores through a crowd-sourcing service. This section provides crucial details about the dataset, including the types of tasks participants were asked to perform (e.g., recounting a recent dream, a negative memory, or their biggest mistake) and the number of participants involved (54 participants from 446 sessions).

I will also look for any specific names or identifiers for the dataset. The authors do not provide a unique name for the dataset but describe it in detail, which is sufficient for my purposes. I will summarize the dataset's characteristics, including the number of recordings, the types of tasks, and the demographic information collected.

After gathering the dataset details, I will check the **References section** to find any citations related to the methodologies or questionnaires used in the dataset collection. The authors reference several questionnaires, such as the Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire (SPQ) and the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS2), which are essential for understanding the dataset's context.

The full citations for the questionnaires mentioned in the paper are as follows:

- For the **Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire (SPQ)**:
  > Raine, A. (1991). The SPQ: A Scale for the Assessment of Schizotypal Personality Based on DSM-III-R Criteria. *Schizophrenia Bulletin*, 17(4), 555–564. https://doi.org/10.1093/schbul/17.4.555

- For the **Social Responsiveness Scale, Second Edition (SRS-2)**:
  > Constantino, J. N., & Gruber, C. P. (2012). *Social Responsiveness Scale, Second Edition (SRS-2)*. Western Psychological Services.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its context, I will compile the information into a structured format that includes the dataset description and the relevant citations.

In summary, I will document the following dataset information:
1. **Dataset Name**: Japanese Audio-Report Dataset (not explicitly named in the paper)
2. **Description**: Collected audio reports from 54 participants, focusing on schizotypal and autistic traits, with various tasks and demographic information.
3. **Citations**:
   - Raine, A. (1991). The SPQ: A Scale for the Assessment of Schizotypal Personality Based on DSM-III-R Criteria. *Schizophrenia Bulletin*, 17(4), 555–564. https://doi.org/10.1093/schbul/17.4.555
   - Constantino, J. N., & Gruber, C. P. (2012). *Social Responsiveness Scale, Second Edition (SRS-2)*. Western Psychological Services.

Finally, I will ensure that all extracted information is clear and concise, ready for further processing or review.
