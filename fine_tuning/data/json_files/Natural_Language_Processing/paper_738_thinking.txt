To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Uncovering Flaming Events on News Media in Social Media" by Praboda Rajapaksha et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the study focuses on detecting flaming events in social media, specifically using a sentiment prediction method, which suggests that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will examine **section III (Experiments)**, where the authors describe their methodology for dataset collection. They mention implementing a crawler to collect 300 public posts and related comments from three news media outlets (BBCNews, CNN, and FoxNews) during February 2018. This indicates that a dataset was created for the purpose of their analysis.

In **section III.A (Dataset description and pre-processing)**, the authors provide more details about the dataset. They specify that they collected posts and comments from the Facebook pages of BBCNews, CNN, and FoxNews, and they describe the preprocessing steps applied to the data. This section confirms the existence of a dataset and provides context for its use in the study.

Now, I will look for the **full citations** of the datasets mentioned. The authors do not provide formal citations for the datasets in the references section, but I can construct them based on the information provided in the paper:

1. **Dataset of Facebook Posts and Comments**: This dataset consists of 300 public posts and their associated comments collected from the Facebook pages of BBCNews, CNN, and FoxNews during February 2018. The citation for this dataset can be structured as follows:
   > Rajapaksha, P., Farahbakhsh, R., Crespi, N., & Defude, B. (2018). *Uncovering Flaming Events on News Media in Social Media*. Retrieved from [insert URL or DOI if available].

2. **SCL-NMA Dataset**: The authors reference the Sentiment Composition Lexicon for Negators, Models, and Degree Adverbs (SCL-NMA) dataset, which is used for sentiment classification. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Kiritchenko, S., & Mohammad, S. M. (2017). *The effect of negators, modals, and degree adverbs on sentiment composition*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1712.01794.

After identifying these datasets and their citations, I will compile the information into a structured format for further processing or review. This will ensure that the datasets are properly documented and can be referenced in future work.
