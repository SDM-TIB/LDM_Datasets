To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ICDBigBird: A Contextual Embedding Model for ICD Code Classification" by George Michalopoulos et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the effectiveness of the ICDBigBird model on a "real-world clinical dataset," which suggests that a specific dataset is being used.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly mention the dataset used for their experiments. They state that they conducted their experiments on the **MIMIC-III dataset**, specifically a subset containing the top 50 most frequent ICD codes. This section provides crucial details about the dataset's purpose and the context in which it was used.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the MIMIC-III dataset. The relevant citation is:

- **MIMIC-III Dataset**: 
  > Alistair EW Johnson, Tom J Pollard, Lu Shen, H Lehman Li-wei, Mengling Feng, Mohammad Ghassemi, Benjamin Moody, Peter Szolovits, Leo Anthony Celi, and Roger G Mark. *MIMIC-III, a freely accessible critical care database*. Scientific Data, 3:160035, 2016.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets, I will compile the information regarding the MIMIC-III dataset into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation as required.

After gathering all necessary information, I will prepare the dataset entry for the MIMIC-III dataset, ready for further processing or review.
