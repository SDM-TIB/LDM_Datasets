To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Hard Prompts Made Interpretable: Sparse Entropy Regularization for Prompt Tuning with RL" by Yunseon Choi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions evaluating the proposed method across various tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved. I will look for specific names of datasets in these sections.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the use of prompt tuning and mention that they evaluate their approach across various tasks, including few-shot text classification and unsupervised text style transfer. This indicates that there are likely datasets associated with these tasks.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**. Here, the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used for their experiments. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names and characteristics.

From the text, I identify the following datasets used in their experiments:

1. **SST-2 Dataset**: This dataset is used for sentiment classification tasks. It consists of sentences from movie reviews, where the task is to classify the sentiment as either positive or negative.

2. **Yelp Polarity Dataset**: This dataset contains reviews from Yelp, where the task is to classify the overall sentiment of the review as positive or negative.

3. **MR Dataset**: This dataset consists of sentences from movie reviews, similar to SST-2, where the classification task is also sentiment-based.

4. **CR Dataset**: This dataset includes customer reviews, and the task is to classify the sentiment of the reviews as positive or negative.

5. **AG’s News Dataset**: This dataset contains news articles, and the task is to classify the articles into one of four topics: World, Sports, Business, or Tech.

6. **Yahoo Answers Dataset**: This dataset consists of passages that need to be classified into one of ten topics, including Culture, Science, Health, Education, Computers, Sports, Business, Music, Family, and Politics.

7. **Subj Dataset**: This dataset includes sentences from reviews, where the task is to classify the sentences as subjective or objective.

Now, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for these datasets. This is crucial for proper documentation.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
