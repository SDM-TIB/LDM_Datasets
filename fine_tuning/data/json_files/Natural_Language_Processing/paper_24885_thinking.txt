To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CoMix: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Multi-Task Comic Understanding" by Emanuele Vivoli et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** sections to get an overview of the datasets discussed. The abstract mentions that CoMix comprises three existing datasets with expanded annotations, which indicates that I should look for these datasets in detail.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Books in the CoMix)**, where the authors describe the datasets included in the CoMix benchmark. Here, they mention the following datasets:

1. **Manga109**: This dataset is noted for its various iterations that have enriched the annotations landscape, including object detection and character re-identification.

2. **PopManga**: This dataset offers annotations for character and text detection, as well as speaker identification and re-identification.

3. **eBDtheque**: This dataset provides detection annotations for panels, characters, text lines, and some occurrences of character faces.

The authors also mention that CoMix includes a new dataset of American comic-style books, which they have incorporated to enhance the diversity of comic styles.

In **section 4 (Annotation in the CoMix benchmark)**, the authors provide more details about the annotations and the tasks enabled by these datasets, confirming their relevance for the benchmark.

Now, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for each dataset:

- For **Manga109**, the citation is:

- For **PopManga**, the citation is:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations. This will ensure that the datasets are accurately represented and properly cited for future reference or use in research.
