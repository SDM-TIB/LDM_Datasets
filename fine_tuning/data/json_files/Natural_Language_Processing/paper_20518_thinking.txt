To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Neuron-centric Hebbian Learning" by Andrea Ferigo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and while it may not explicitly mention datasets, it often highlights the context in which the research is conducted. The introduction typically discusses related work and may reference datasets used in previous studies.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, as it often details the experimental setup, including any datasets used for training or evaluation. In this paper, the authors mention testing their model on two simulated robotic locomotion tasks, which suggests that there may be datasets associated with these tasks.

In the **experiments section**, the authors describe the specific tasks and configurations they used. They mention using a Voxel-based Soft Robots (VSR) simulator and a quadruped robotic task from the MuJoCo suite. I will look for any specific dataset names or references to datasets used in these experiments.

After identifying potential datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets.

For the datasets mentioned in this paper, I will summarize them as follows:

1. **Voxel-based Soft Robots (VSR) Dataset**: This dataset is used for simulating locomotion tasks with soft robots. The authors refer to a simulation tool for the optimization of 2-D voxel-based soft robots, which is likely a dataset or a collection of simulation scenarios.

   Citation:

2. **MuJoCo Ant Task Dataset**: This dataset is associated with the Ant task, which involves a quadruped robot moving on a flat terrain. The authors mention using the PyBullet physics engine for this task, which indicates that the dataset may be part of the MuJoCo suite.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This systematic approach ensures that I accurately capture all relevant datasets and their citations from the research paper.
