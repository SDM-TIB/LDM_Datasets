To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The Impact of AI Tool on Engineering at ANZ Bank: An Empirical Study on GitHub Copilot Within Corporate Environment" by Sayan Chatterjee et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, indicating that it involves an experiment with GitHub Copilot, which suggests that there may be datasets related to participant performance and feedback.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly the **data collection approach**. Here, the authors describe the sources of data they used to analyze developer productivity, code quality, and sentiment. They mention four sources: GitHub Copilot metrics, surveys, static code analysis, and grading of correctness. This indicates that there are multiple datasets involved.

In the **data collection approach**, the authors specify the metrics collected from GitHub Copilot, including the number of suggestions provided, acceptance rates, and the number of languages used. This information is crucial for identifying the dataset related to GitHub Copilot's performance.

The surveys conducted during the experiment also represent a dataset. The authors mention baseline surveys and weekly surveys to gather participant sentiment and productivity metrics. I will note the specific metrics they collected, such as total time spent solving problems and unit test success ratios.

Additionally, the **static code analysis** performed using SonarQube provides another dataset related to code quality and security vulnerabilities. The authors describe how they assessed the code submitted by participants, which is essential for understanding the dataset's context.

Now, I will check the **results section** to see if the authors provide any specific statistics or summaries related to the datasets. They present findings on productivity improvements, code quality metrics, and participant sentiment, which will help me describe the datasets more comprehensively.

Finally, I will refer to the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets or studies mentioned. While the paper does not explicitly mention external datasets, it references studies that may provide context or comparison points for the findings.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the datasets into a structured format, ensuring to include full citations for any referenced studies or datasets used in the analysis. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets involved in the research.
