To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Mobile Data Driven Hierarchical Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach for Real-time Demand-Responsive Railway Rescheduling and Station Overcrowding Mitigation" by Enze Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, results, and discussion sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study and mentions the use of **mobile data (MD)** to model passenger dynamics, which indicates that this dataset is crucial for the research.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, where the authors describe how they utilize mobile data to infer real-time in-station demand. They mention that the mobile data captures anonymous passenger movement in real time, which is essential for their demand-responsive approach. I will look for specific details about the mobile data, such as its source, structure, and any preprocessing steps mentioned.

In the **results section**, the authors discuss the performance of their hierarchical deep reinforcement learning (HDRL) model and how it was tested using real-world data from a specific disruption scenario (the Zhengzhou flood). This section may provide insights into how the datasets were used in the experiments and any additional datasets that were referenced.

I will also check the **appendices**, as they often contain supplementary information about datasets, including descriptions of the mobile data, its attributes, and any other relevant datasets used in the analysis.

After identifying the datasets, I will compile the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. For the **mobile data**, the authors acknowledge the provision of this data by Smart Step Digital Technology Co., Ltd., which will be included in the citation.

Here are the datasets I will extract:

1. **Mobile Data (MD)**: This dataset captures the mobility of passengers using signal towers and is used to infer real-time in-station demand. The authors describe its attributes, such as entering time, leaving time, leaving mode, and user quantity.

The full citation for the mobile data is:
> Smart Step Digital Technology Co., Ltd. *Mobile Data for Railway Passenger Movement Analysis*. [Data source description].

Next, I will ensure that I have accurately documented the details of the mobile data, including its purpose, how it was collected, and its relevance to the study.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for easy reference and review. This will include a clear description of each dataset, its source, and its significance in the context of the research.
