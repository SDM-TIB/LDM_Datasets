To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Experiments on Paraphrase Identification Using Quora Question Pairs Dataset" by Andreas Chandra and Ruben Stefanus, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors modeled the **Quora question pairs dataset** to identify similar questions, indicating that this dataset is central to their research.

Next, I will look for specific details about the dataset in the **experiments section**. In section 4, the authors describe the dataset as consisting of **404,290 observations**, where each observation consists of a pair of questions labeled as either similar or not. This section confirms that the **Quora Question Pairs dataset** is the primary dataset used in their experiments.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the **Quora Question Pairs dataset**. The paper provides a link to the dataset, which is hosted on GitHub. The citation for the dataset is as follows:

- **Quora Question Pairs Dataset**:
  > Quora. *Quora Question Pairs Dataset*. Available at: https://github.com/jakartaresearch/quora-question-pairs.

Since the dataset is provided by Quora and the authors have referenced it directly, I will ensure to include this citation in my dataset entry.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and the full citation as required. 

After completing this process, I will have a clear and accurate representation of the dataset used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
