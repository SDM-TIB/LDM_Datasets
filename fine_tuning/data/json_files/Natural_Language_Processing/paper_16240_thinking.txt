To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On the Out-of-Distribution Coverage of Combining Split Conformal Prediction and Bayesian Deep Learning" by Paul Scemama and Ariel Kapusta, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus, which may include references to datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** in detail, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used in their evaluations. I will look for any specific names or descriptions of datasets, including their characteristics, sizes, and any relevant details about how they were used in the experiments.

In this paper, I notice that the authors mention two datasets in the **experiments section**:

1. **CIFAR10 Dataset**: This dataset is described as containing 60,000 32x32 RGB images across 10 classes, with a specific breakdown of training and testing images.

2. **MedMNIST Dataset**: This dataset includes various standardized datasets of biomedical images, specifically mentioning the organCmnist and organSmnist datasets, which are used for classification tasks.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access the datasets.

The citations I find are:

- For **CIFAR10 Dataset**:
  > Krizhevsky, A., Hinton, G., et al. (2009). *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. 

- For **MedMNIST Dataset**:
  > Yang, J., Shi, R., Wei, D., Liu, Z., Zhao, L., Ke, B., Pfister, H., & Ni, B. (2023). *MedMNIST v2 - a large-scale lightweight benchmark for 2D and 3D biomedical image classification*. Scientific Data, 10(1), 41.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference. This will include the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all necessary details are included for future use or verification.
