To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Dynamic Correlation Learning and Regularization for Multi-Label Confidence Calibration" by Tianshui Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the introduction of a new task called Multi-Label Confidence Calibration (MLCC) and hints at the use of datasets for evaluation. This suggests that datasets will be discussed further in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology or experiments sections**. In this paper, the authors mention using two well-known datasets for their experiments: **MS-COCO** and **Visual Genome**. I will note down the details provided about these datasets, including their characteristics and the context in which they are used.

In the **experiments section**, the authors describe how they utilize these datasets for evaluating their proposed method. They mention that MS-COCO consists of 122,218 images with 80 categories, and Visual Genome contains 108,249 images with dense annotations. This information is crucial for understanding the datasets' relevance to the study.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **MS-COCO**, the citation is:
  > T.-Y. Lin, M. Maire, S. Belongie, J. Hays, P. Perona, D. Ramanan, P. Dollár, and C. L. Zitnick. "Microsoft coco: Common objects in context." In *Computer Vision–ECCV 2014: 13th European Conference, Zurich, Switzerland, September 6-12, 2014, Proceedings, Part V*, pages 740–755, 2014.

- For **Visual Genome**, the citation is:
  > R. Krishna, Y. Zhu, O. Groth, J. Johnson, K. Hata, J. Kravitz, S. Chen, Y. Kalantidis, L.-J. Li, D. A. Shamma et al. "Visual genome: Connecting language and vision using crowdsourced dense image annotations." *International Journal of Computer Vision*, vol. 123, pp. 32–73, 2017.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described with its name, characteristics, and full citation. This structured approach will help in accurately documenting the datasets used in the research paper.
