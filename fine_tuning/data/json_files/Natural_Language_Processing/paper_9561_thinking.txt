To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The NPU-ASLP System for Audio-Visual Speech Recognition in MISP 2022 Challenge" by Pengcheng Guo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the NPU-ASLP system for the Audio-Visual Diarization and Recognition (AVDR) task in the MISP 2022 Challenge, but it does not specify any datasets. The introduction provides context about the challenge but does not name any datasets either.

Next, I will examine the **data processing and simulation** section (2.1) for any references to datasets. Here, the authors mention the use of "106 hours Near data provided by the challenge," which indicates that there is a specific dataset associated with the MISP 2022 Challenge. However, the exact name of the dataset is not provided in this section.

I will also check the **experiments** section (3.1) to see if there are any additional details about the datasets used for training and evaluation. The authors mention that the total training data is about 1300 hours, which includes the Near data and augmented data, but again, they do not provide specific dataset names.

To ensure I have not missed any references, I will review the **references section** to see if any cited works provide information about the datasets. The references include papers related to the MISP Challenge, but they do not explicitly list datasets.

The only dataset that is clearly mentioned is the "106 hours Near data" provided by the MISP 2022 Challenge. I will need to find the full citation for this dataset. The MISP Challenge is referenced in the paper, and I can use the citation provided in reference [1] to document it.

The full citation for the MISP Challenge dataset is:
> Hang Chen, Hengshun Zhou, Jun Du, Chin-Hui Lee, Jingdong Chen, et al., “The first multimodal information based speech processing (MISP) challenge: Data, Tasks, Baselines and Results,” in Proc. ICASSP. IEEE, 2022, pp. 9266–9270.

Now, I will compile the dataset entry for the "Near data" used in the MISP 2022 Challenge, ensuring to include the full citation.

After gathering all necessary information, I will prepare the dataset entry for review or further processing.
