To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Mitigating Open-Vocabulary Caption Hallucinations" by Assaf Ben-Kish et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract introduces the **OpenCHAIR benchmark**, which is a key component of the research, indicating that it is likely a dataset or benchmark used in their experiments.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (The OpenCHAIR Benchmark)**, where the authors describe the construction and purpose of the OpenCHAIR dataset. They explain that it is designed to measure hallucinations in image captioning in an open-vocabulary setting. This section provides detailed information about how the dataset was created, including the use of captions from the **MS-COCO dataset** as seeds for generating diverse synthetic captions.

In this section, the authors also mention the **Stable Diffusion XL** model used to generate images corresponding to the captions, which indicates that the dataset consists of synthetic images paired with diverse captions.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. **OpenCHAIR**: The authors do not provide a specific citation for OpenCHAIR in the references, but they describe it as a new benchmark they are introducing. Therefore, I will note it as a dataset created by the authors of this paper.

2. **MS-COCO**: The citation for the MS-COCO dataset is:
   > Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, Serge Belongie, Lubomir Bourdev, Ross Girshick, James Hays, Pietro Perona, Deva Ramanan, C. Lawrence Zitnick, and Piotr Dollár. *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. In Proceedings of the European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), pages 740–755, 2014.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

- **OpenCHAIR**: A benchmark dataset created by the authors to evaluate open-vocabulary hallucinations in image captioning.
- **MS-COCO**: A widely used dataset for image captioning that provides images and corresponding object annotations.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for clarity and future reference.
