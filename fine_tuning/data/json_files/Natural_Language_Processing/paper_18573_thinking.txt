To extract datasets from the research paper titled "FedShift: Tackling Dual Heterogeneity Problem of Federated Learning via Weight Shift Aggregation" by Jungwon Seo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used. In this case, the abstract does not mention specific datasets, so I will proceed to the introduction.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of federated learning but do not specify any datasets. Therefore, I will move on to the **experiments section**, which is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets used for evaluation.

In **section 4.1 (Dataset)**, the authors explicitly mention that they used the **CIFAR10 dataset** for their main experiments. They describe it as containing 50,000 images for training and 10,000 images for testing, focusing on measuring the top-1 accuracy of the global model. This section confirms that CIFAR10 is a key dataset for their research.

Next, I will look for the full citation of the CIFAR10 dataset in the **References section**. The citation for the CIFAR10 dataset is as follows:
> Krizhevsky, A., Nair, V., and Hinton, G. C. *CIFAR-10 (Canadian Institute for Advanced Research)*. URL http://www.cs.toronto.edu/˜kriz/cifar.html.

Since the paper also mentions conducting experiments with different datasets, such as CIFAR100, I will check if there is any additional information about it in the experiments section. The authors mention CIFAR100 in the context of additional experiments, but they do not provide a separate dataset description or citation in the main body of the text. However, I can infer that CIFAR100 is also a significant dataset used in their research.

I will now look for the citation for the CIFAR100 dataset in the **References section**. The citation is typically similar to that of CIFAR10, but I will confirm it:
> Krizhevsky, A., Nair, V., and Hinton, G. C. *CIFAR-100 (Canadian Institute for Advanced Research)*. URL http://www.cs.toronto.edu/˜kriz/cifar.html.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will summarize the findings:

1. **CIFAR10 Dataset**: Used for the main experiments, containing 50,000 training images and 10,000 testing images.
   - Citation: Krizhevsky, A., Nair, V., and Hinton, G. C. *CIFAR-10 (Canadian Institute for Advanced Research)*. URL http://www.cs.toronto.edu/˜kriz/cifar.html.

2. **CIFAR100 Dataset**: Mentioned in the context of additional experiments.
   - Citation: Krizhevsky, A., Nair, V., and Hinton, G. C. *CIFAR-100 (Canadian Institute for Advanced Research)*. URL http://www.cs.toronto.edu/˜kriz/cifar.html.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or processing.
