To extract datasets from the research paper titled "LLM360: Towards Fully Transparent Open-Source LLMs" by Zhengzhong Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to look for any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the release of two LLMs, AMBER and CRYSTALCODER, and indicates that they include training data. This suggests that datasets are involved, but I need to find specific names and details.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Initial Model Release)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used for training both AMBER and CRYSTALCODER. In this section, they describe the pre-training datasets for each model:

1. **AMBER Dataset**: The pre-training data for AMBER is a mixture of several datasets, including RefinedWeb, StarCoder, and RedPajama, totaling approximately 1.26 trillion tokens. The authors provide a breakdown of the data mix, which is crucial for understanding the dataset composition.

2. **CRYSTALCODER Dataset**: The pre-training dataset for CRYSTALCODER consists of SlimPajama and StarCoder data, amounting to around 1.382 trillion tokens. The authors detail the three-stage training process and the specific data used in each stage, which is important for transparency.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations of the datasets mentioned. The paper does not provide explicit citations for the datasets like RefinedWeb, SlimPajama, or StarCoder, but I can infer their sources based on the context provided in the paper and existing literature.

For example, I can look for the following citations based on the context:

- **RefinedWeb**: This dataset is mentioned in the context of web data collection and may have a citation in related works or its own publication.
- **StarCoder**: The authors reference a paper that describes this dataset, which I will need to locate for proper citation.
- **RedPajama**: Similar to RefinedWeb, I will need to find the original source for this dataset.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as accurately as possible.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in the required format for further processing or review.
