To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Investigating Bias Representations in Llama 2 Chat via Activation Steering" by Dawn Lu and Nina Rimsky, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors utilized the **StereoSet dataset** and custom prompts generated by GPT-4 for their experiments. This suggests that these datasets are crucial for understanding their methodology.

Next, I will examine the **Methodology and Data** section, where the authors provide more details about the datasets used. Here, they explicitly mention the **StereoSet dataset**, describing it as a large-scale natural English dataset intended to measure stereotypical biases across various domains. This confirms its significance in their research.

Additionally, the authors mention that they created a **custom set of gender-bias prompts** and used GPT-4 to generate similar examples. While this is not a traditional dataset, it is important to note it as part of their data collection process.

I will also look for any references to datasets in the **experiments** or **results** sections, but it seems that the primary dataset of interest is the **StereoSet dataset**.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to gather the full citation for the **StereoSet dataset**. The citation provided in the references is:

- **StereoSet dataset**:
  > Moin Nadeem, Anna Bethke, and Siva Reddy. *Stereoset: Measuring stereotypical bias in pretrained language models*. 2020.

Since the authors also mention using custom prompts generated by GPT-4, I will note that as well, but it does not have a formal citation like a dataset would.

In summary, the key dataset extracted from the paper is the **StereoSet dataset**, and I will ensure to include its full citation in the final output. I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and completeness.
