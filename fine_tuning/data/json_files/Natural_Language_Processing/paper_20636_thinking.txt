To extract datasets from the research paper titled "End-to-End Mineral Exploration with Artificial Intelligence and Ambient Noise Tomography" by Jack Muir et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, results, and data availability sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a high-level overview, and while it may not list specific datasets, it sets the context for what the paper discusses. The introduction often highlights the significance of the research and may mention datasets used for analysis.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, where the authors typically describe the datasets utilized in their research. In this paper, the authors mention using various geophysical data layers for their prospectivity model. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sources, and any relevant details about their resolution or characteristics.

In the **results section**, the authors may refer to the datasets again, particularly when discussing the outcomes of their analyses or models. This will help confirm the datasets identified earlier and provide additional context for their use.

The **data availability section** is crucial as it often contains a summary table of datasets used in the study, including their sources and any relevant identifiers. In this paper, there is a table (Table 1) that lists the datasets along with their resolutions and sources, which will be essential for compiling the full citations.

Now, I will extract the datasets mentioned in the paper:

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries with their full citations for further processing or review. This structured approach ensures that I accurately capture all relevant datasets and their sources as presented in the research paper.
