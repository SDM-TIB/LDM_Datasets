To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Distributed Momentum Methods Under Biased Gradient Estimations" by Ali Beikmohammadi, Sarit Khirirat, and Sindri Magnusson, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses numerical experiments on training deep neural networks with Top-K sparsification and clipping, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this section, the authors describe their experiments using the **MNIST** and **FashionMNIST** datasets. They provide details about the number of training and test images for each dataset, which confirms their use in the experiments.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the **References section** of the paper:

1. **MNIST Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Yann LeCun. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/, 1998.

2. **FashionMNIST Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Han Xiao, Kashif Rasul, and Roland Vollgraf. *Fashion-MNIST: A Novel Image Dataset for Benchmarking Machine Learning Algorithms*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1708.07747, 2017.

After identifying the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use.

In summary, the datasets extracted from the paper are:
- **MNIST Dataset** with its citation.
- **FashionMNIST Dataset** with its citation.

This systematic approach ensures that I capture all relevant datasets and their proper citations from the research paper.
