To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Impact and Integration of Mini Photovoltaic Systems on Electric Power Distribution Grids" by Gökhan Demirel et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and conclusion** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on mini-photovoltaic (MPV) systems and their impact on low-voltage grids, but it does not explicitly mention datasets.

Next, I will examine the **methodology and case studies sections**. In the case studies, the authors mention conducting real-world time series data analysis and simulations, which suggests that datasets are involved. Specifically, they mention the creation of the **MPVBench dataset**, which is described as containing real-time MPV data for the energy community, along with associated metadata.

I will also check the **experiments section** for any additional datasets used in the analysis. The authors reference using benchmark tools like **SimBench** for evaluating control mechanisms in inverter-based distributed energy resources (DER). This indicates that SimBench is another dataset relevant to their research.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper:

1. **MPVBench Dataset**: The authors state that this dataset contains real-time MPV data and is available on their GitHub repository. However, since the citation is not provided in the text, I will note that it is an open-source dataset developed by the authors.

2. **SimBench Dataset**: The citation for this dataset is:
   > Meinecke, S., Sarajlić, D., Drauz, S. R., Klettke, A., Lauven, L.-P., Rehtanz, C., Moser, A., & Braun, M. (2020). SimBench—a benchmark dataset of electric power systems to compare innovative solutions based on power flow analysis. *Energies*, 13(12), 3290. 

After identifying these datasets and their citations, I will compile the information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their respective citations.
