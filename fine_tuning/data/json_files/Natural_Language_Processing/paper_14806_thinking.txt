To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Predict-and-Optimize Approach to Profit-Driven Churn Prevention" by Nuria Gómez-Vargas et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the proposed method is evaluated on **12 churn prediction datasets**, which indicates that there are multiple datasets involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experimental Results)**, specifically **subsection 4.1 (Data description)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the datasets used. Here, they mention that the datasets are derived from a Chilean mutual fund company and contain customer demographic features, behavior data, and financial indexes. They also specify that there are **12 different datasets** corresponding to customer bases from January to December 2017.

In this subsection, the authors provide a summary of the datasets in **Tables 3 and 4**, which include the number of customers, variables, churn rates, and customer lifetime values (CLVs) for each month. This detailed description confirms the presence of multiple datasets.

Now, I will compile the full citations for the datasets mentioned in the paper. Since the datasets are derived from a specific company and the paper does not provide external citations for these datasets, I will note that they are proprietary datasets from a Chilean mutual fund company. However, I will still document the relevant details as follows:

1. **Dataset 1 (January)**: Contains 786 training instances and 197 testing instances with a churn rate of 16.99% and a CLV of 85.00e.
2. **Dataset 2 (February)**: Contains 792 training instances and 198 testing instances with a churn rate of 16.97% and a CLV of 85.00e.
3. **Dataset 3 (March)**: Contains 792 training instances and 198 testing instances with a churn rate of 17.17% and a CLV of 88.20e.
4. **Dataset 4 (April)**: Contains 818 training instances and 205 testing instances with a churn rate of 16.32% and a CLV of 88.40e.
5. **Dataset 5 (May)**: Contains 844 training instances and 211 testing instances with a churn rate of 17.25% and a CLV of 86.80e.
6. **Dataset 6 (June)**: Contains 889 training instances and 223 testing instances with a churn rate of 18.35% and a CLV of 91.20e.
7. **Dataset 7 (July)**: Contains 924 training instances and 231 testing instances with a churn rate of 19.74% and a CLV of 91.00e.
8. **Dataset 8 (August)**: Contains 930 training instances and 233 testing instances with a churn rate of 18.23% and a CLV of 92.20e.
9. **Dataset 9 (September)**: Contains 938 training instances and 235 testing instances with a churn rate of 19.35% and a CLV of 90.60e.
10. **Dataset 10 (October)**: Contains 961 training instances and 241 testing instances with a churn rate of 20.38% and a CLV of 87.40e.
11. **Dataset 11 (November)**: Contains 972 training instances and 244 testing instances with a churn rate of 21.46% and a CLV of 87.20e.
12. **Dataset 12 (December)**: Contains 962 training instances and 241 testing instances with a churn rate of 17.87% and a CLV of 89.40e.

Since these datasets are proprietary and specific to the study, I will note that the citation for these datasets is:
> Gómez-Vargas, N., Maldonado, S., & Vairetti, C. (2023). A Predict-and-Optimize Approach to Profit-Driven Churn Prevention. *Preprint*.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing.
