To extract datasets from the research paper titled "NoteLLM-2: Multimodal Large Representation Models for Recommendation" by Chao Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the study, which may include references to datasets used.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **Datasets** section, which is typically where authors describe the datasets they utilized for their experiments. In this paper, I will specifically check **section 2.2 (Datasets and Experimental Settings)**, as it appears to be the section where the authors discuss the datasets they constructed and used for their experiments.

In this section, the authors mention that they obtained a real-world multimodal item-to-item (I2I) dataset from their platform. They describe the training dataset, which contains 1.5 million notes and 1.1 million note pairs, and the testing dataset, which contains 0.5 million notes and 21,262 note pairs. This information is crucial as it indicates the scale and nature of the datasets used.

I will also check the **Appendix C**, where the authors provide detailed statistics of the training and testing datasets. This will help me gather more specific information about the datasets, such as the average number of words per title and content.

After gathering the necessary details, I will consult the **References section** to find any citations related to the datasets mentioned. However, since the datasets are constructed from user behavior data and are not standard datasets from previous works, they may not have formal citations. In this case, I will note that the datasets are proprietary and derived from the authors' platform.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I clearly describe each dataset, including its purpose, size, and any relevant statistics. If there are no formal citations for the datasets, I will indicate that they are proprietary datasets created by the authors.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets used in the research paper while adhering to the importance of providing full citations where applicable.
