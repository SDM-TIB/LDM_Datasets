To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Continual Driving Policy Optimization with Closed-Loop Individualized Curricula" by Haoyi Niu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned or referenced. The abstract discusses the development of a framework for autonomous vehicles (AV) and mentions the use of a scenario library, which suggests that there may be datasets involved.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this paper, the authors mention that all traffic scenarios used in their experiments are generated by (Re)2H2O. This indicates that (Re)2H2O is a dataset or a method for generating datasets relevant to their research.

I will then check the **appendix** for any additional details about the dataset. The appendix provides a detailed description of the scenario data, stating that it consists of 65,494 extreme scenarios generated under specific conditions, with a high accident rate. This information is crucial for understanding the dataset's characteristics.

Now, I will compile the full citation for the dataset mentioned:

1. **(Re)2H2O Dataset**: The dataset is referenced in the paper as follows:
   > Niu, H., Hu, J., Cui, Z., & Zhang, Y. (2023). (Re)2H2O: Autonomous driving scenario generation via reversely regularized hybrid offline-and-online reinforcement learning. In Proceedings of the 2023 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV), pp. 1-8.

Finally, I will ensure that I have accurately captured the dataset's name, its description, and the full citation. This will allow me to present the information in a structured manner for further processing or review.

In summary, I will extract the following dataset information:
- Dataset Name: (Re)2H2O Dataset
- Description: A dataset containing 65,494 extreme scenarios generated for autonomous vehicle training and testing.
- Full Citation: Niu, H., Hu, J., Cui, Z., & Zhang, Y. (2023). (Re)2H2O: Autonomous driving scenario generation via reversely regularized hybrid offline-and-online reinforcement learning. In Proceedings of the 2023 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV), pp. 1-8.

After gathering this information, I will be ready to format it according to the required structure for further use.
