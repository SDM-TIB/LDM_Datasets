To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Moving Target Sensing for ISAC Systems in Clutter Environment" by Dongqi Luo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, but it may not contain detailed dataset information. The introduction often discusses related work and may mention datasets used in prior studies.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets or experiments**. In many research papers, authors will describe the datasets they used for their experiments in a specific section, often labeled as "Datasets" or "Experimental Setup." This section typically includes details about the datasets, such as their names, sizes, and characteristics.

In this paper, I will pay special attention to any **tables or figures** that might summarize the datasets or present results derived from them. For example, Table I lists generated kinematic parameters of targets, which may imply the use of a dataset for simulation purposes.

After identifying any datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

For this paper, I will summarize the findings as follows:

1. **Simulation Dataset**: The authors mention that they assume there are 2 moving targets and 400 scatters in the environment, with parameters distributed according to specific distributions. However, they do not reference a publicly available dataset but rather describe a simulated environment.

2. **Citations**: Since the paper does not reference any external datasets, I will note that the dataset is derived from simulations rather than an established dataset.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the paper itself, as it serves as the source of the dataset information.

The citation for the paper is:
> Dongqi Luo, Huihui Wu, Hongliang Luo, Bo Lin, and Feifei Gao. "Moving Target Sensing for ISAC Systems in Clutter Environment." *Department of Automation, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China*.

This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture the relevant dataset information from the paper while providing proper citations.
