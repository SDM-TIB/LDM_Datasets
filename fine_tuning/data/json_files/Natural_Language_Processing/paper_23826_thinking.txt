To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SUBLLM: A Novel Efficient Architecture with Token Sequence Subsampling for LLM" by Quandong Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the architecture and its efficiency but does not mention specific datasets. The introduction focuses on the challenges faced by large language models (LLMs) and does not provide dataset details either.

Next, I will examine **section 4 (Experiments)**, which is likely to contain information about the datasets used for training and evaluation. In this section, the authors mention using **SlimPajama** as the pre-training corpus. This is a significant dataset, and I need to gather more details about it.

In the **References section**, I will look for the full citation of the SlimPajama dataset. The paper cites it as follows:
> SlimPajama: A 627B token cleaned and deduplicated version of RedPajama. https://www.cerebras.net/blog/slimpajama-a-627b-token-cleaned-and-deduplicated-version-of-redpajama, June 2023.

This citation provides the necessary details about the dataset, including its size and the source.

Now, I will summarize the findings:

1. **SlimPajama**: This dataset is used as the pre-training corpus for the SUBLLM model. It consists of a large collection of text data, specifically cleaned and deduplicated, which is crucial for training language models effectively.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry with the full citation into a structured format for further processing or review.
