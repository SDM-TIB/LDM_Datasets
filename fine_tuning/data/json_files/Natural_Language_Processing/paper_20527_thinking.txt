To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Alpha-wolves and Alpha-mammals: Exploring Dictionary Attacks on Iris Recognition Systems" by Sudipta Banerjee et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to get an overview of the study and see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method using the **IITD**, **CASIA-IrisV4-Thousand**, and **CASIA-IrisV4-Synthetic** datasets. This is a good starting point.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for any additional context or details about these datasets. The introduction discusses the vulnerability of iris recognition systems and mentions the datasets again, confirming their relevance to the study.

I will then look at the **experimental design** section, which is crucial for understanding how the datasets were used. Here, the authors provide specific details about each dataset:

1. **IITD Dataset**: This dataset comprises 224 subjects with 1,188 left eye images and 1,052 right eye images. It is used for both wolf selection and evaluation.

2. **CASIA-IrisV4-Thousand Dataset**: This dataset includes 1,000 subjects with 10,000 left eye images and 10,000 right eye images.

3. **CASIA-IrisV4-Synthetic Dataset**: This synthetic dataset contains 10,000 images from 1,000 synthetic identities, with no distinction between left or right eye images.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:

- For the **IITD Dataset**, the citation is:
  > IIT Delhi Iris Database. https://www4.comp.polyu.edu.hk/˜csajaykr/IITD/Database_Iris.htm. [Online accessed Jan 2023].

- For the **CASIA-IrisV4-Thousand Dataset**, the citation is:
  > CASIA Iris V4 Database. https://hycasia.github.io/dataset/casia-irisv4/. [Online accessed May 2023].

- For the **CASIA-IrisV4-Synthetic Dataset**, the citation is included in the reference for the CASIA-IrisV4-Thousand dataset, as it is a part of the same database.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations, ensuring that I document each dataset clearly and accurately.

In summary, I will extract the following datasets with their citations:
1. IITD Dataset
   - Citation: IIT Delhi Iris Database. https://www4.comp.polyu.edu.hk/˜csajaykr/IITD/Database_Iris.htm. [Online accessed Jan 2023].
   
2. CASIA-IrisV4-Thousand Dataset
   - Citation: CASIA Iris V4 Database. https://hycasia.github.io/dataset/casia-irisv4/. [Online accessed May 2023].

3. CASIA-IrisV4-Synthetic Dataset
   - Citation: CASIA Iris V4 Database. https://hycasia.github.io/dataset/casia-irisv4/. [Online accessed May 2023].

With this structured approach, I will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations for further processing or review.
