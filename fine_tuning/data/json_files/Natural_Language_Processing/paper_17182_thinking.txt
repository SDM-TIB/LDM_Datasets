To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Exploring Sound vs Vibration for Robust Fault Detection on Rotating Machinery" by Serkan Kiranyaz et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any mention of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors present a new benchmark dataset called the **Qatar University Dual-Machine Bearing Fault Benchmark dataset (QU-DMBF)**, which is a strong indication that this is a primary dataset of interest.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for further details about the dataset. The introduction reiterates the significance of the QU-DMBF dataset, emphasizing its role in providing both sound and vibration data across various working conditions. This section confirms that the QU-DMBF dataset is central to the study.

I will then look into **section II (Exploration Methodology and QU-DMBF Dataset)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the QU-DMBF dataset. They mention that it includes sound and vibration data from two different motors under 1080 working conditions, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's scope and application.

In this section, the authors also describe the experimental setup and the data collection process, which further solidifies the importance of the QU-DMBF dataset. They provide specifics about the types of machines used, the configurations, and the conditions under which the data was collected.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the QU-DMBF dataset. The authors mention that the dataset is publicly shared, and I will ensure to include the link provided in the paper for access.

The citation for the QU-DMBF dataset is:
> Kiranyaz, S., Devecioglu, O. C., Alhams, A., Sassi, S., Ince, T., Avci, O., & Gabbouj, M. (2023). *Exploring Sound vs Vibration for Robust Fault Detection on Rotating Machinery*. Available: https://github.com/OzerCanDevecioglu/Exploring-Sound-vs-Vibration-for-Robust-Fault-Detection-on-Rotating-Machinery

Finally, I will compile the extracted information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the dataset used in the research paper.
