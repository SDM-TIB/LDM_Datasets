To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Survey on Lexical Ambiguity Detection and Word Sense Disambiguation" by Miuru Abeysiriwardana and Deshan Sumanathilaka, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and related work sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract discusses various techniques in NLP, particularly focusing on Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD), but does not explicitly mention any datasets. I will need to look deeper into the body of the paper.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any references to datasets used in the studies discussed. The introduction mentions challenges in the field, such as the scarcity of sense-annotated corpora, which suggests that datasets may be discussed later in the paper.

I will then look at the **related work section** where the authors review various approaches to WSD. This section often contains references to datasets used in previous studies. I will pay close attention to any citations that mention specific datasets or corpora.

In the **findings and analysis section**, the authors discuss various studies and their methodologies. Here, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets used in those studies. For example, if a study is referenced that utilizes a specific dataset for WSD, I will note that down.

I will also check the **tables** included in the paper, particularly **Table II**, which compares models and datasets. This table may provide direct references to datasets used in the studies discussed.

Once I identify the datasets, I will need to gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This will involve consulting the **References section** of the paper to find the appropriate citations for the datasets. Each dataset will need to be accurately cited to ensure proper attribution.

For example, if I find that the paper references the "ULS-WSD-18" and "UAW-WSD-18" datasets, I will look for their full citations in the references. If the citations are not directly provided, I may need to look up the original papers or sources that introduced these datasets.

After compiling the dataset names and their full citations, I will summarize the findings in a clear format, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described along with its citation.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for any required output format, ensuring that all information is organized and ready for review or further processing.
