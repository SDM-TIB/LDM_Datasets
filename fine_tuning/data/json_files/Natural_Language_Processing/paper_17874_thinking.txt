To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Generalizable Models via Disentangling Spurious and Enhancing Potential Correlations" by Na Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions "Digits-DG," which suggests that this dataset is used in their experiments.

Next, I will focus on **section IV (Experiments)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they explicitly list four datasets:

1. **PACS**: This dataset contains 9,991 images across 7 classes and 4 domains (Photo, Art painting, Cartoon, and Sketch). The authors note that PACS is commonly used for domain generalization tasks.

2. **VLCS**: This dataset consists of 10,729 images across 5 classes and 4 domains (Caltech-101, LabelME, PASCAL VOC 2007, and Sun09). The authors mention that they adopt the official split for their experiments.

3. **Office-Home**: This dataset includes around 15,500 images covering 65 categories and 4 domains (Artistic, Clipart, Product, and Real-World). The authors state that they randomly split the dataset into training and validation sets.

4. **Digits-DG**: This dataset is a combination of four handwritten digit recognition datasets (MNIST, MNIST-M, SVHN, and SYN). The authors explain that they randomly select 600 images per class for each domain and split the data into training and validation sets.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. However, the paper does not provide specific citations for the datasets used, as they are well-known datasets in the domain of computer vision and machine learning.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the names and descriptions of each dataset as follows:

- **PACS**: Contains 9,991 images with 7 classes and 4 domains (Photo, Art painting, Cartoon, and Sketch).
- **VLCS**: Comprises 10,729 images across 5 classes and 4 domains (Caltech-101, LabelME, PASCAL VOC 2007, and Sun09).
- **Office-Home**: Includes around 15,500 images covering 65 categories and 4 domains (Artistic, Clipart, Product, and Real-World).
- **Digits-DG**: A combination of MNIST, MNIST-M, SVHN, and SYN datasets, with 600 images per class for each domain.

Finally, I will ensure that I have accurately documented the datasets with their respective descriptions, ready for any further processing or review.
