To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Mobile-Seed: Joint Semantic Segmentation and Boundary Detection for Mobile Robots" by Youqi Liao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that experiments were conducted on the **Cityscapes dataset**, **CamVid**, and **PASCAL Context datasets**. This suggests that these datasets are crucial for the research.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments** section. In the **experimental evaluation section**, the authors explicitly state that they conducted experiments on the **Cityscapes**, **CamVid**, and **PASCAL Context** datasets. This confirms that these datasets are used in their research.

Now, I will gather detailed information about each dataset, including their characteristics and the context in which they were used. The paper mentions that the **Cityscapes dataset** is used for semantic urban scene understanding, **CamVid** is a high-definition ground truth database for semantic object classes in video, and **PASCAL Context** is used for object detection and semantic segmentation.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. **Cityscapes Dataset**:
   > Cordts, M., Omran, M., Ramos, S., Rehfeld, T., Enzweiler, M., Benenson, R., Franke, U., Roth, S., & Schiele, B. (2016). The cityscapes dataset for semantic urban scene understanding. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pp. 3213–3223.

2. **CamVid Dataset**:

3. **PASCAL Context Dataset**:
   > Mottaghi, R., Chen, X., Liu, X., Cho, N.-G., Lee, S.-W., Fidler, S., Urtasun, R., & Yuille, A. (2014). The role of context for object detection and semantic segmentation in the wild. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pp. 891–898.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their full citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured all necessary details regarding the datasets used in the research.
