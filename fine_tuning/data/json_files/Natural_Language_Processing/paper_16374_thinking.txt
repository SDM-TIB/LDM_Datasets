To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Side4Video: Spatial-Temporal Side Network for Memory-Efficient Image-to-Video Transfer Learning" by Huanjin Yao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. In the abstract, the authors reference their method's performance on various video datasets, which indicates that datasets are likely discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4), particularly **subsection 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors typically provide a comprehensive list of datasets used for their evaluations. Here, I will look for specific names and descriptions of the datasets.

Upon reviewing subsection 4.1, I find the following datasets mentioned:

1. **Something-Something V1 & V2 (SSV1 and SSV2)**: These datasets are used for action recognition and contain a large number of videos categorized into various action classes. The authors note that SSV1 has 110K videos and SSV2 has 220K videos across 174 classes.

2. **Kinetics-400 (K400)**: This is another dataset used for action recognition, comprising 300K video clips across 400 human action classes.

3. **MSR-VTT**: This dataset is utilized for text-video retrieval and consists of 10K videos, each with 20 textual descriptions.

4. **MSVD**: This dataset contains 1970 video clips with approximately 80K descriptive sentences, also used for text-video retrieval.

5. **VATEX**: A large-scale dataset with 34,991 videos, used for text-video retrieval, containing multiple annotations.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and should be formatted correctly.

The full citations I find are:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or processing. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets referenced in the paper along with their proper citations.
