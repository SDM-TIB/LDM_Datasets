To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Global-Local Collaborative Inference with LLM for Lidar-Based Open-Vocabulary Detection" by Xingyu Peng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that extensive experiments were conducted on **ScanNetV2** and **SUN RGB-D**, indicating that these are the datasets used in the study.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of these datasets in the **experiments section** (section 4.1). Here, the authors explicitly state that they conducted experiments on two datasets: 

1. **ScanNetV2**: This dataset is described as a widely used 3D object detection and semantic segmentation dataset, containing 1513 scenes with over 200 object classes.

2. **SUN RGB-D**: This dataset is noted as a large 3D object detection and scene understanding dataset, which contains 10,335 samples with around 800 object classes.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **ScanNetV2**, the citation is:
  > Dai, A., Chang, A.X., Savva, M., Halber, M., Funkhouser, T., Nießner, M. *ScanNet: Richly-annotated 3D reconstructions of indoor scenes*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 5748–5758, 2017.

- For **SUN RGB-D**, the citation is:
  > Song, S., Lichtenberg, S.P., Xiao, J. *SUN RGB-D: A RGB-D scene understanding benchmark suite*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 567–576, 2015.

Having gathered this information, I will now prepare to create structured entries for each dataset, ensuring that the full citations are included for proper referencing. This will allow for clear documentation of the datasets used in the research.
