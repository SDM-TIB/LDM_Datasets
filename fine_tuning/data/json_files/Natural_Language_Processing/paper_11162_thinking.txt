To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Pairwise Ranking Losses of Click-Through Rates Prediction for Welfare Maximization in Ad Auctions" by Boxiang Lyu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions demonstrating advantages on "synthetic and real-world data," which suggests that datasets are involved, but I need to find specific names.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** in detail. In this section, the authors explicitly mention using the **Criteo Display Advertising Challenge dataset** as a benchmark for their experiments. This is a clear indication of a dataset being utilized.

I will also look for any other datasets mentioned throughout the paper, particularly in the **related works** or **methodology sections**. However, the primary focus seems to be on the Criteo dataset, which is a well-known dataset in the field of click-through rate prediction.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Criteo dataset. The authors do not provide a specific citation for the dataset itself, but they reference the Criteo Display Advertising Challenge, which is commonly cited in related literature.

The citation for the Criteo dataset is:
> Criteo. *Criteo Display Advertising Challenge*. Available at: https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~r01922136/kaggle-2014-criteo.pdf.

Since the paper primarily discusses the Criteo dataset and synthetic data generated for experiments, I will summarize the findings as follows:

1. **Criteo Display Advertising Challenge Dataset**: This dataset is used for evaluating the proposed methods in the context of click-through rate prediction in ad auctions.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for clarity and future reference.
