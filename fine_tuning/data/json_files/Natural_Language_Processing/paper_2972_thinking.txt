To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Is human scoring the best criteria for summary evaluation?" by Oleg Vasilyev and John Bohannon, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of summary quality measures, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the body of the paper.

In the **introduction**, the authors reference various families of automated measures of summary quality, but again, no specific datasets are named. However, they mention the **CNN/Daily Mail dataset** in the context of evaluating summary quality, which is a significant clue.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section**. In **section 3.1**, the authors explicitly state that they considered four types of summaries derived from the **CNN/Daily Mail dataset**. This confirms that this dataset is used in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the **CNN/Daily Mail dataset**. The citation is as follows:
> Karl Moritz Hermann, Tomáš Kočiský, Edward Grefenstette, Lasse Espeholt, Will Kay, Mustafa Suleyman, and Phil Blunsom. *Teaching machines to read and comprehend*. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, volume 28, pages 1693–1701, 2015.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format.

The only dataset extracted from this paper is the **CNN/Daily Mail dataset**, and I will ensure to include the full citation as required. 

After this, I will prepare the dataset entry for the output.
