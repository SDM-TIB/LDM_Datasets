To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Local Appearance Model for Volumetric Capture of Diverse Hairstyles" by Ziyan Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the creation of high-fidelity avatars using multi-view captures of hundreds of people, which suggests that there is a dataset involved. The introduction further emphasizes the importance of capturing diverse hairstyles, indicating that a dataset is likely used for this purpose.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the **experiments section** (specifically section 4) describes the dataset collected for their study. It states that the dataset consists of multiview RGB images of around 260 identities, with each capture having approximately 160 views.

The details provided in section 4.1 specify that the dataset includes lightstage captures of multiple identities, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's structure and purpose. The authors also mention that they excluded captures of 8 identities for testing purposes, which is important for dataset integrity.

Now, I will compile the information about the dataset, including its name, description, and any relevant details. I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the dataset. However, in this case, the dataset is described in the paper itself without a separate citation, so I will summarize the dataset information based on the details provided.

The dataset can be summarized as follows:
- **Dataset Name**: Multiview RGB Image Dataset
- **Description**: A dataset containing lightstage captures of approximately 260 identities, with each identity captured from around 160 views focusing on the head and hair region. The dataset is designed for training and testing models for generating personalized avatars.

Since there is no specific citation provided for the dataset in the references, I will note that the dataset is part of the authors' original work and does not have an external citation.

Finally, I will ensure that I have accurately captured all relevant details and prepare to format this information according to the required structure for downstream processing.
