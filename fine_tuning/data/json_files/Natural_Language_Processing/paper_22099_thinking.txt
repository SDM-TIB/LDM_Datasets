To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Generalist Robot Learning from Internet Video: A Survey" by Robert McCarthy et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the focus on learning from video data, which suggests that datasets will be discussed later in the paper. The introduction elaborates on the challenges and opportunities in leveraging internet video data for robotics, indicating that specific datasets may be referenced.

Next, I will navigate to **section 6 (Datasets)**, which is explicitly dedicated to discussing datasets. This section will likely provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used or recommended for learning from video. I will look for any named datasets, their characteristics, and how they relate to the research objectives.

In **subsection 6.3 (Existing Datasets)**, the authors provide a table summarizing various datasets. I will extract the relevant datasets listed in this table, noting their names, content duration, and any specific characteristics mentioned. The datasets include:

1. **InternVid**: A large-scale internet-scraped video dataset.
   - Citation: Wang, C., Luo, X., Ross, K. W., & Li, D. (2023). InternVid: A large-scale video-text dataset for multimodal understanding and generation. ArXiv, abs/2307.06942.

2. **Ego4D**: Contains egocentric video of diverse participants.
   - Citation: Grauman, K., Westbury, A., Byrne, E., Chavis, Z. Q., Furnari, A., Girdhar, R., Hamburger, J., Jiang, H., Liu, M., Liu, X., Martin, M., Nagarajan, T., Radosavovic, I., Ramakrishnan, S. K., Ryan, F., & et al., J. S. (2021). Ego4D: Around the world in 3,000 hours of egocentric video. In Proceedings of the European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), pp. 720–736.

3. **Ego-Exo4D**: Paired egocentric and third-person video of skilled activities.
   - Citation: Grauman, K., Westbury, A., Torresani, L., Kitani, K., Malik, J., Afouras, T., Ashutosh, K., Baiyya, V., Bansal, S., Boote, B., et al. (2023). Ego-exo4D: Understanding skilled human activity from first-and third-person perspectives. 

4. **Something-Something V2**: Contains short clips of object-centric actions.
   - Citation: Goyal, R., Kahou, S. E., Michalski, V., Materzynska, J., Westphal, S., Kim, H., Haenel, V., Fründ, I., Yianilos, P. N., Mueller-Freitag, M., Hoppe, F., Thurau, C., Bax, I., & Memisevic, R. (2017). The “Something Something” video database for learning and evaluating visual common sense. 

5. **RoboVQA**: Contains video of teleoperated robots and humans performing long-horizon household tasks.
   - Citation: Sermanet, P., Ding, T., Zhao, J., Xia, F., Dwibedi, D., Gopalakrishnan, K., Chan, C., Dulac-Arnold, G., Maddineni, S., Joshi, N. J., et al. (2023). RoboVQA: Multimodal long-horizon reasoning for robotics.

6. **Epic-Kitchens-100**: Contains long-form video of cooking activities in real households.
   - Citation: Damen, D., Doughty, H., Farinella, G. M., Furnari, A., Kazakos, E., Ma, J., Moltisanti, D., Munro, J., Perrett, T., Price, W., et al. (2022). Rescaling egocentric vision: Collection, pipeline and challenges for Epic-Kitchens-100.

After identifying these datasets, I will ensure to compile their full citations accurately as they are crucial for proper referencing in any subsequent work or analysis.

Finally, I will summarize the findings in a structured manner, ensuring clarity and completeness in the documentation of each dataset's details and citations.
