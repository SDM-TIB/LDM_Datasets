To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Brain-Inspired Two-Stage Approach: Enhancing Mathematical Reasoning by Imitating Human Thought Processes" by Yezeng Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract indicates that the authors propose a novel approach to enhance mathematical reasoning abilities, which suggests that they may have utilized specific datasets for their experiments.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Brain)**, where the authors discuss their methodology in detail. Here, they mention the use of various models and datasets. Specifically, they state that they utilized four models from the ToRA series to perform inference on the GSM8K train set, resulting in a dataset of reasoning paths. This is a clear indication that the GSM8K dataset is one of the datasets used in their experiments.

In **section 4 (Experiments)**, the authors provide further details about the datasets used for training and evaluation. They mention conducting supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with 55K data for the Frontal Lobe Model and 90K data for the Parietal Lobe Model. They also refer to the GSM8K dataset as the evaluation benchmark for their models.

Now, I will compile the full citations for the datasets mentioned in the paper. The GSM8K dataset is referenced as follows:

- For the **GSM8K dataset**, the citation is:
  > Karl Cobbe, Vineet Kosaraju, Mohammad Bavarian, Mark Chen, Heewoo Jun, Lukasz Kaiser, Matthias Plappert, Jerry Tworek, Jacob Hilton, Reiichiro Nakano, Christopher Hesse, and John Schulman. *Training verifiers to solve math word problems*. 2021.

Additionally, the authors mention using models like Code LLaMA, but since they do not specify a separate dataset for it, I will focus on the GSM8K dataset as the primary dataset referenced.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets in a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
