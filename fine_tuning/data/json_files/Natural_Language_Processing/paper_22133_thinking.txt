To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards End-to-End Semi-Supervised Table Detection with Semantic Aligned Matching Transformer" by Tahira Shehzadi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract highlights the importance of large labeled datasets for training deep learning models, which suggests that datasets will be discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 5), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. Here, they mention four datasets: **TableBank**, **PubLayNet**, **PubTables**, and **ICDAR-19**. I will extract the relevant details for each dataset, including their characteristics and the context in which they were used.

1. **TableBank**: The authors describe it as a prominent dataset for table recognition tasks, comprising 417,000 document images annotated from the arXiv database. They specifically mention using the table detection component of this dataset.

2. **PubLayNet**: This dataset contains 335,703 images with annotations for various document elements, including tables. The authors note that they used a subset of images specifically related to table annotations for their experiments.

3. **PubTables**: The authors describe this dataset as having nearly one million tables, specifically designed for table detection in scientific documents, with comprehensive annotations for precise location information.

4. **ICDAR-19**: This dataset was introduced for the ICDAR 2019 competition on table detection and recognition, and the authors mention using it for direct comparisons with previous methods.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets.

The full citations I will extract are:

- **TableBank**:
  > Li, M., Cui, L., Huang, S., Wei, F., Zhou, M., & Li, Z. (2019). *TableBank: A benchmark dataset for table detection and recognition*. 

- **PubLayNet**:
  > Zhong, X., Tang, J., & Yepes, A. J. (2019). *PubLayNet: Largest dataset ever for document layout analysis*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition (ICDAR).

- **PubTables**:
  > Smock, B., Pesala, R., & Abraham, R. (2022). *PubTables-1M: Towards comprehensive table extraction from unstructured documents*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR).

- **ICDAR-19**:
  > Gao, L., Huang, Y., D'ejean, H., Meunier, J.-L., Yan, Q., Fang, Y., Kleber, F., & Lang, E. (2019). *ICDAR 2019 competition on table detection and recognition (cTDaR)*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition (ICDAR).

Finally, I will compile the extracted dataset information and their citations into a structured format for easy reference and further processing. This systematic approach ensures that I capture all relevant details while maintaining the integrity of the citations.
