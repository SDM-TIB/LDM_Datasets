To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Exploring Backdoor Vulnerabilities of Chat Models" by Yunzhuo Hao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, experiments, and conclusion sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments demonstrating the effectiveness of their backdoor attack method, which suggests that datasets were used for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention the construction of a poisoned dataset for training the backdoored model, which includes both poisoned conversation data and clean conversation data. They specify that the poisoned dataset consists of **Multi. Trigger Scenarios Poisoned Data** with 2,000 samples for each poisoning setting.

I will also look for specific datasets mentioned in the context of data collection and poisoning procedures. The authors reference the **UltraChat_200k** dataset, which is a heavily filtered version of the original UltraChat dataset, and the **HuggingFaceH4 2023** dataset, which is used for sampling conversation data related to malicious scenarios.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the **References section** of the paper:

1. **UltraChat_200k Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Ning Ding, Yulin Chen, Bokai Xu, Yujia Qin, Zhi Zheng, Shengding Hu, Zhiyuan Liu, Maosong Sun, and Bowen Zhou. *Enhancing chat language models by scaling high-quality instructional conversations*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2305.14233, 2023.

2. **HuggingFaceH4 2023 Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Hugging Face. *HuggingFaceH4 2023 Dataset*. Available at: https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/h4.

After identifying these datasets and their citations, I will summarize the key details about each dataset, including their purpose and the context in which they were used in the experiments.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for easy reference and further processing.
