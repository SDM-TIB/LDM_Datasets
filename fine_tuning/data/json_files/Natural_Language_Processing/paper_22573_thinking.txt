To extract datasets from the research paper titled "BonnBot-I Plus: A Bio-diversity Aware Precise Weed Management Robotic Platform" by Alireza Ahmadi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the introduction of a new dataset compatible with precision weeding, which indicates that there is at least one dataset to extract. The introduction further emphasizes the advancements in weed management algorithms and the real-world performance of the BonnBot-I platform, hinting at the practical applications of the datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any relevant subsections that might provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the research. In this paper, the authors mention the **SB21 dataset** in the **Experimental Setup** section, specifically in subsection B. Here, they describe the dataset's composition, including the number of RGB-D frames, the types of crops and weeds included, and the annotation details.

The SB21 dataset is described as follows:
- It consists of 84 RGB-D frames of crops and 12 distinct weed categories, totaling 942 instances of sugar beet and 4989 instances of weeds. The dataset is divided into training, validation, and evaluation sets.

Additionally, the authors reference two previously released datasets, **SB20** and **WeedAI**, which are also relevant to their work. I will need to extract information about these datasets as well.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and will include the authors, title, publication venue, and year.

1. For the **SB21 dataset**, since it is a new dataset introduced in this paper, I will cite it as follows:
   > Alireza Ahmadi, Michael Halstead, Claus Smitt, and Chris McCool. *BonnBot-I Plus: A Bio-diversity Aware Precise Weed Management Robotic Platform*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS), 2023.

2. For the **SB20 dataset**, the citation is:
   > Alireza Ahmadi, Michael Halstead, and Chris McCool. *Virtual Temporal Samples for Recurrent Neural Networks: Applied to Semantic Segmentation in Agriculture*. In German Conference on Pattern Recognition, 2021.

3. For the **WeedAI dataset**, the citation is:
   > Michael Halstead, P. Zimmer, and C. McCool. *A Cross-Domain Challenge with Panoptic Segmentation in Agriculture*. The International Journal of Robotics Research, 2024.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research, ready for further processing or review.
