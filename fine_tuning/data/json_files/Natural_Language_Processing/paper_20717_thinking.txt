To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Enhancing Video Transformers for Action Understanding with VLM-aided Training" by Hui Lu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors achieve state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks like **Kinetics-400** and **Something-Something V2**, which indicates that these datasets are likely used in their experiments.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors detail the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they explicitly mention the following datasets:

1. **Kinetics-400**: This dataset is described as one of the most widely used action recognition benchmarks, consisting of 240K training videos and 20K validation videos, with an average duration of 10 seconds.

2. **Something-Something V2 (SSV2)**: This dataset includes 169K training and 25K validation videos, categorized into 174 motion-centric classes of humans performing actions with objects.

3. **UCF-101**: A smaller dataset consisting of 9.5K training videos and 3.5K validation videos.

4. **HMDB51**: Another compact dataset containing 3.5K training videos and 1.5K validation videos.

5. **AVA V2.2**: This dataset is used for spatio-temporal localization of human actions, comprising 211K training and 57K validation video segments.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
