To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MuseChat: A Conversational Music Recommendation System for Videos" by Zhikang Dong et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract, introduction, and dataset sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. In the abstract, the authors mention building a **large-scale dataset** for evaluating their conversational music recommendation system, which indicates that a dataset is indeed present.

Next, I will focus on the **dataset section (Section 3)**, where the authors describe the dataset in detail. They mention that they created a conversational music recommendation dataset using the **YouTube8M dataset**. This dataset is crucial as it serves as the foundation for their experiments.

In the dataset section, the authors provide specific details about how they constructed their dataset, including the number of music videos and the process of generating dialogues. They state that they collected **98,206 music videos** labeled as "music video" from YouTube8M, which is a significant detail.

Now, I will look for the full citation of the **YouTube8M dataset** in the **References section**. The citation is as follows:
> Sami Abu-El-Haija, Nisarg Kothari, Joonseok Lee, Paul Natsev, George Toderici, Balakrishnan Varadarajan, and Sudheendra Vijayanarasimhan. *YouTube-8M: A Large-Scale Labeled Video Dataset for Video Classification*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1609.08675, 2016.

Additionally, the authors mention using the **Million Song Dataset (MSD)** and the **MagnaTagATune (MTT)** dataset for music tagging purposes. I will also retrieve the citations for these datasets.

The citation for the **Million Song Dataset** is:
> Thierry Bertin-Mahieux, Daniel P.W. Ellis, Brian Whitman, and Paul Lamere. *The Million Song Dataset*. In Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Music Information Retrieval (ISMIR 2011), 2011.

The citation for the **MagnaTagATune dataset** is:
> Umut GucÂ¸lu, Jordy Thielen, Michael Hanke, and Marcel A. J. van Gerven. *Brains on Beats*. 2016.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and that the full citations are included for reference. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
