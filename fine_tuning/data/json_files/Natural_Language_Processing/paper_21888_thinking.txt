To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Decentralized Personalized Federated Learning based on a Conditional ‘Sparse-to-Sparser’ Scheme" by Qianyu Long et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and it may mention datasets used for experiments or evaluations. 

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section VI) where the authors typically describe the datasets used in their evaluations. In this section, I will look for specific mentions of datasets, including their names and any relevant details about how they were used in the experiments.

Upon reviewing Section VI, I find that the authors conducted experiments on three datasets: **HAM10000**, **CIFAR10**, and **CIFAR100**. They also mention the partition methods used to create non-i.i.d. scenarios, which are important for understanding the context of the datasets.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset from the **References section** of the paper. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets.

1. **HAM10000 Dataset**: The citation is:
   > P. Tschandl, C. Rosendahl, and H. Kittler. "The HAM10000 dataset, a large collection of multi-source dermatoscopic images of common pigmented skin lesions." *Scientific Data*, vol. 5, no. 1, pp. 1–9, 2018.

2. **CIFAR10 Dataset**: The citation is:
   > A. Krizhevsky, I. Sutskever, and G. E. Hinton. "Imagenet classification with deep convolutional neural networks." *Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems*, vol. 25, 2012.

3. **CIFAR100 Dataset**: The citation is:
   > A. Krizhevsky, G. Hinton et al. "Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images." 2009.

After collecting the dataset names and their citations, I will summarize this information clearly, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its corresponding citation.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that can be used for further processing or review.
