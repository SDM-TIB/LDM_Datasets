To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Docs2KG: Unified Knowledge Graph Construction from Heterogeneous Documents Assisted by Large Language Models" by Yuanyi Luo et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the extraction of multimodal information from various document types, which suggests that there may be datasets involved, but I need to look for specific names.

In the **introduction**, the authors emphasize the importance of extracting meaningful information from unstructured documents, but they do not explicitly mention any datasets. I will continue to the methodology section for more details.

In **section 3 (Docs2KG Framework)**, the authors describe the types of documents that the framework can handle, including emails, web pages, PDF files, and Excel files. However, they do not specify any particular datasets used in their experiments or demonstrations.

Next, I will check the **demonstration section (section 4)**, where they mention using a PDF file containing information about the population size and structure of Hong Kong from 2011 to 2021, and an Excel file with records of the population census from 2021 to 2023. These documents are used to illustrate the capabilities of the Docs2KG framework, but they do not provide formal dataset names or citations.

Finally, I will look at the **References section** to see if any datasets are cited. The references include various works related to knowledge graphs and document processing, but they do not provide specific datasets that were used in the research.

Since the paper does not provide formal datasets with citations, I will note that the authors utilized a PDF and an Excel file for their demonstration, but these are not formally published datasets with citations. Therefore, I will summarize the findings as follows:

1. **Population Data PDF**: Contains information about the population size and structure of Hong Kong from 2011 to 2021. However, no formal citation is provided for this document.

2. **Population Census Excel File**: Contains records of the population census from 2021 to 2023. Again, no formal citation is provided.

In conclusion, while the paper discusses the use of specific documents for demonstration purposes, it does not provide formal datasets with citations. I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity, noting the absence of formal citations for the datasets mentioned.
