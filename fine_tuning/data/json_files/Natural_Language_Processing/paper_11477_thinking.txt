To extract datasets from the research paper titled "TryOnDiffusion: A Tale of Two UNets" by Luyang Zhu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract states that the method is trained on **4 Million image pairs**, which indicates a dataset is involved, but I need to find more specific details.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (Section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for training and testing. In this section, they mention that they collected a paired training dataset of **4 Million samples**, consisting of images of the same person wearing the same garment in different poses. This is a significant dataset, but I need to check if they provide a specific name or reference for it.

The authors also mention that they provide results on the **VITON-HD dataset**. I will need to gather details about this dataset as well, including its citation.

In the **References section**, I will look for the full citations of the datasets mentioned. The citation for the **VITON-HD dataset** is as follows:
- Seunghwan Choi, Sunghyun Park, Minsoo Lee, and Jaegul Choo. *Viton-HD: High-resolution virtual try-on via misalignment-aware normalization*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 14131â€“14140, 2021.

Since the authors do not provide a specific name for the 4 Million image pairs dataset, I will refer to it as the **TryOnDiffusion Dataset** for clarity in my output.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset. The entries will be structured clearly to reflect the information gathered from the paper.

After completing this process, I will have a comprehensive list of datasets extracted from the paper, ready for further processing or review.
