To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Unbiased Decisions Reduce Regret: Adversarial Domain Adaptation for the Bank Loan Problem" by Elena Gal et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the bank loan problem and mentions the use of "challenging benchmark problems," which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they mention several datasets:

1. **Census Income Dataset**: This dataset is referenced as the "Adult" dataset, which contains demographic information useful for fairness evaluation.

2. **Default of Credit Card Clients Dataset**: This dataset is mentioned as part of their experiments, indicating its relevance to the bank loan problem.

3. **FICO Dataset**: The authors refer to an anonymized dataset of home equity line of credit, which is also used in their experiments.

4. **MNIST Dataset**: The authors mention that they converted the MNIST dataset into a binary reward format for their specific application in the bank loan problem.

Now, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Census Income Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Lichman, M.; et al. 2013. UCI machine learning repository.

- For the **Default of Credit Card Clients Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Lichman, M.; et al. 2013. UCI machine learning repository.

- For the **FICO Dataset**, the citation is:
  > FICO. Explainable machine learning challenge. 2018. https://community.fico.com/s/explainable-machine-learning-challenge. Accessed: 2022-01-01.

- For the **MNIST Dataset**, the citation is:
  > LeCun, Y.; Cortes, C.; and Burges, C. J. C. 1998. The MNIST database of handwritten digits. http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations. This will ensure that all relevant details are captured for future reference or processing.
