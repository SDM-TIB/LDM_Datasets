To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Gender-Neutral Word Embeddings" by Jieyu Zhao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention any datasets used. The introduction often discusses the context and significance of the research, which might include references to datasets.

In the **introduction**, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or references to prior work that utilized specific datasets. The authors may refer to datasets used in previous studies, which could be relevant for understanding their own work.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**. This section typically details the datasets used for evaluation and testing. I will look for any subsections that specifically mention datasets, such as "Datasets" or "Data Collection." Here, the authors may describe the datasets they used, including their characteristics and how they were utilized in the experiments.

In this paper, I notice that the authors mention a dataset called **SemBias**, which is created for evaluating gender relational analogy tasks. They also refer to the **WinoBias dataset**, which is used for coreference resolution tasks. I will take note of these datasets and their descriptions.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets themselves.

For the **SemBias dataset**, the citation is:
> Jurgens, D., Turney, P. D., Mohammad, S. M., & Holyoak, K. J. (2012). Semeval-2012 task 2: Measuring degrees of relational similarity. In Proceedings of the First Joint Conference on Lexical and Computational Semantics-Volume 1: Proceedings of the main conference and the shared task, and Volume 2: Proceedings of the Sixth International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (pp. 356â€“364). Association for Computational Linguistics.

For the **WinoBias dataset**, the citation is:
> Zhao, J., Wang, T., Yatskar, M., Ordonez, V., & Chang, K.-W. (2018). Gender bias in coreference resolution: Evaluation and debiasing methods. NAACL.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described clearly and that the full citations are included for reference. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
