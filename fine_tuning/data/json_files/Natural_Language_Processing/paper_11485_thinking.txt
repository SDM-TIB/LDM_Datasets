To extract datasets from the research paper titled "HePCo: Data-Free Heterogeneous Prompt Consolidation for Continual Federated Learning" by Shaunak Halbe et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the datasets used in the experiments. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on **CIFAR-100**, **ImageNet-R**, and **DomainNet**, which indicates that these datasets are likely central to their research.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (section 5) to find detailed descriptions of how these datasets were utilized. The authors specify that they adapted **CIFAR-100** for their formulation and evaluated their methods on **ImageNet-R** and **DomainNet**. This confirms that all three datasets are indeed used in their experiments.

I will then check the **datasets section** (section 5) for any additional details about these datasets. The paper states that **CIFAR-100** is a commonly used benchmark in continual federated learning, while **ImageNet-R** and **DomainNet** are larger-scale datasets that capture real-world distribution shifts. This contextual information is useful for understanding the datasets' relevance.

Now, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

1. **CIFAR-100**: The citation is:
   > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton, et al. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. Tech Report, 2009.

2. **ImageNet-R**: The citation is:
   > Dan Hendrycks, Steven Basart, Norman Mu, Saurav Kadavath, Frank Wang, Evan Dorundo, Rahul Desai, Tyler Zhu, Samyak Parajuli, Mike Guo, Dawn Song, Jacob Steinhardt, and Justin Gilmer. *The many faces of robustness: A critical analysis of out-of-distribution generalization*. ICCV, 2021.

3. **DomainNet**: The citation is:
   > Xingchao Peng, Qinxun Bai, Xide Xia, Zijun Huang, Kate Saenko, and Bo Wang. *Moment matching for multi-source domain adaptation*. 2019.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

- **CIFAR-100**: A widely used benchmark dataset for image classification, consisting of 100 classes with 600 images per class.
- **ImageNet-R**: A dataset designed to evaluate robustness in image classification, containing various classes and challenging distribution shifts.
- **DomainNet**: A dataset used for domain adaptation, consisting of images from various domains and classes.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly presents each dataset along with its citation, ensuring that the details are accurate and complete for future reference.
