To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DoRA: Weight-Decomposed Low-Rank Adaptation" by Shih-Yang Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a summary of the research and may mention datasets used for evaluation. In the introduction, the authors often discuss the context of their work, which may include references to specific datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as this is where authors typically detail the datasets used for their experiments. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names and descriptions. 

In this paper, the authors mention evaluating their method on various tasks, including commonsense reasoning and visual instruction tuning. They refer to specific datasets used for these tasks, which I will need to identify.

I will also check the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily.

For example, if the authors mention using the **VQAv2 dataset**, I will look for its citation in the references. The citation for VQAv2 is:
> Goyal, Y., Khot, T., Summers-Stay, D., Batra, D., and Parikh, D. "Making the v in vqa matter: Elevating the role of image understanding in visual question answering." In Proceedings of the IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pp. 6904–6913, 2017.

Similarly, if they mention the **GQA dataset**, I will find its citation:
> Hudson, D. A. and Manning, C. D. "GQA: A new dataset for real-world visual reasoning and compositional question answering." In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pp. 6700–6709, 2019.

After identifying the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset's name, description, and full citation.

Finally, I will ensure that all extracted information is accurate and properly formatted, ready for any further processing or review.
