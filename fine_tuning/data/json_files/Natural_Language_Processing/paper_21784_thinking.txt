To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Beyond Pixel-Wise Supervision for Medical Image Segmentation: From Traditional Models to Foundation Models" by Yuyan Shi et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the challenges of medical image segmentation and mentions the use of weak annotations, which suggests that datasets may be referenced.

Next, I will focus on **section II (Task Formulation)** and **section III (Solutions for Medical Image Segmentation with Weak Annotations)**, as these sections are likely to contain specific datasets used in the experiments. I will look for any tables or figures that summarize the datasets, as they often provide concise information.

In **Table I**, I find references to several datasets used for weakly supervised medical image segmentation methods. The datasets mentioned include:

1. **TMAs (Tissue Microarrays)**: Used for microscope images, referenced in the context of weakly supervised segmentation methods.
2. **LIDC-IDRI**: A dataset for CT images, specifically for lung nodule analysis.
3. **ProMRI**: A dataset for MRI images, used in various segmentation tasks.
4. **ACDC (Automated Cardiac Diagnosis Challenge)**: A dataset for cardiac MRI segmentation.
5. **CHAOS**: A dataset for abdominal organ segmentation.

In **Table II**, I will also check for datasets related to bounding box annotations. The datasets mentioned include:

1. **IUGR dataset**: Used for MRI images.
2. **PROMISE12**: Another dataset for MRI images.
3. **MSD liver**: A dataset for liver segmentation in CT images.
4. **NIH**: A dataset for various lesions.

Next, I will consult the **References section** to retrieve the full citations for these datasets. This is crucial for proper attribution and to ensure that the datasets can be accessed by others.

For example, the citation for the **LIDC-IDRI dataset** is:
> Armato III, S. G., McLennan, G., Bidaut, L., McNitt-Gray, M. F., Meyer, C. R., Reeves, A. P., Zhao, B., Aberle, D. R., Henschke, C. I., & Hoffman, E. A. (2011). The lung image database consortium (lidc) and image database resource initiative (idri): a completed reference database of lung nodules on ct scans. *Medical Physics*, 38(2), 915-931.

I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described with its full citation, and prepare them for structured output.

After gathering all necessary information, I will summarize the datasets in a clear format, ensuring that all citations are complete and accurate for future reference.
