To extract datasets from the research paper titled "TELEClass: Taxonomy Enrichment and LLM-Enhanced Hierarchical Text Classification with Minimal Supervision" by Yunyi Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the experiments are conducted on "two public datasets," which indicates that datasets are indeed present. I will look for specific names or descriptions of these datasets.

Next, I will carefully read through the **experiments section** (Section 4.1) where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they describe the datasets as follows:

1. **Amazon-531**: This dataset consists of Amazon product reviews and features a three-layer label taxonomy of 531 product types. It includes 29,487 unlabeled training samples and 19,685 testing samples.

2. **DBpedia-298**: This dataset comprises Wikipedia articles and has a three-layer label taxonomy of 298 categories, with 196,665 unlabeled training samples and 49,167 testing samples.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. 

For **Amazon-531**, the citation is:
> Julian McAuley and Jure Leskovec. *Hidden factors and hidden topics: understanding rating dimensions with review text*. In RecSys, 2013.

For **DBpedia-298**, the citation is:
> Jens Lehmann, Robert Isele, Max Jakob, Anja Jentzsch, Dimitris Kontokostas, Pablo N. Mendes, Sebastian Hellmann, Mohamed Morsey, Patrick van Kleef, S. Auer, and Christian Bizer. *DBpedia - A large-scale, multilingual knowledge base extracted from Wikipedia*. Semantic Web, 6(2):167â€“195, 2015.

Now that I have the dataset names and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset along with its citation. This will ensure that the datasets are properly documented and can be referenced in future work or research.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for review or further processing, ensuring that all necessary details are included for each dataset.
