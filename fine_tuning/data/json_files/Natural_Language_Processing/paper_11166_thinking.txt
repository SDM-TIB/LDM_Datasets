To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Active Learning on Medical Image" by Angona Biswas et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** of the paper to locate any references to datasets. The abstract discusses the challenges of limited annotated medical image data, which suggests that datasets are likely to be mentioned later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, specifically **section 3 (Case Description with Dataset information)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the datasets used in their study. Here, they mention the use of the **BRATS 2019 dataset**, which contains MRI data for brain tumor classification. The authors describe the dataset as consisting of 335 individuals with brain tumor diagnoses, including 259 patients with high-grade gliomas (HGG) and 76 patients with low-grade gliomas (LGG). They also provide details about the MRI sequences included in the dataset.

In addition to the BRATS dataset, I will check for any other datasets mentioned throughout the paper. The authors reference the **ImageNet dataset** in the context of transfer learning, but this is not a dataset they directly use for their experiments; rather, it serves as a pre-training resource for their model.

Now, I will gather the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. **BRATS 2019 Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Spyridon Bakas, Hamed Akbari, Aristeidis Sotiras, Michel Bilello, Martin Rozycki, Justin S Kirby, John B Freymann, Keyvan Farahani, and Christos Davatzikos. *Advancing the cancer genome atlas glioma MRI collections with expert segmentation labels and radiomic features*. Scientific Data, 4(1):1–13, 2017.

2. **ImageNet Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Olga Russakovsky, Jia Deng, Hao Su, Jonathan Krause, Sanjeev Satheesh, Sean Ma, Zhiheng Huang, Andrej Karpathy, Aditya Khosla, Michael Bernstein, et al. *Imagenet large scale visual recognition challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 115:211–252, 2015.

After compiling this information, I will ensure that I have accurately documented the datasets and their citations, ready for further processing or review. This structured approach will help ensure that all relevant datasets are captured and properly cited.
