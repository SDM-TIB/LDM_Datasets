To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Social Welfare Functions" by Kanad Shrikar Pardeshi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are referenced. The abstract mentions a dataset of utility vectors for a food resource allocation task, which suggests that there is a specific dataset used in their experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 6) where the authors describe their empirical results. Here, they mention using a dataset from Lee et al. (2019) related to a US-based nonprofit that operates a donation transportation service. This is a clear indication of a dataset that is crucial for their analysis.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the dataset mentioned. The relevant citation for the dataset is:

- For the dataset from Lee et al. (2019):
  > Lee, M. K., Kusbit, D., Kahng, A., Kim, J. T., Yuan, X., Chan, A., See, D., Noothigattu, R., Lee, S., Psomas, A., et al. *WeBuildAI: Participatory framework for algorithmic governance*. Proceedings of the ACM on human-computer interaction, 3(CSCW):1–35, 2019.

Now, I will summarize the dataset information:

1. **Dataset Name**: WeBuildAI Dataset
   - **Description**: This dataset includes utility vectors for a food resource allocation task, derived from the operations of a US-based nonprofit organization. It contains utility functions learned from various stakeholders involved in the donation process.
   - **Citation**: Lee, M. K., Kusbit, D., Kahng, A., Kim, J. T., Yuan, X., Chan, A., See, D., Noothigattu, R., Lee, S., Psomas, A., et al. *WeBuildAI: Participatory framework for algorithmic governance*. Proceedings of the ACM on human-computer interaction, 3(CSCW):1–35, 2019.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format for further use or analysis. This systematic approach ensures that I accurately capture the datasets referenced in the paper along with their proper citations.
