To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Real-Time Non-Invasive Imaging and Detection of Spreading Depolarizations through EEG: An Ultra-Light Explainable Deep Learning Approach" by Yinzhe Wu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of EEG for non-invasive detection of spreading depolarizations (SDs), which suggests that there may be datasets related to EEG recordings.

Next, I will focus on the **Methods section**, particularly the subsection titled "Patient Studies," where the authors describe the patient recruitment and data collection process. Here, they mention that data was collected from two patients at Kingâ€™s College Hospital, which indicates that there are specific datasets associated with these patients.

In this section, the authors provide details about the EEG and ECoG data collected from the patients. For **Patient #1**, they recorded EEG and ECoG data for 39 hours, confirming 17 occurrences of SDs. For **Patient #2**, they recorded data for 22 hours, with no SDs detected. This information is crucial as it outlines the datasets used in their study.

I will also check the **Results section** to see if there are any additional details about the datasets or any specific metrics related to the data analysis. However, the primary dataset information is already captured in the Methods section.

Now, I will compile the full citations for the datasets mentioned in the paper. The authors note that the EEG dataset may be available upon reasonable request, which is important for potential users of the dataset.

The citations for the datasets are as follows:

1. **EEG Dataset from Patient #1**:
   > Yinzhe Wu et al. "Real-Time Non-Invasive Imaging and Detection of Spreading Depolarizations through EEG: An Ultra-Light Explainable Deep Learning Approach." *IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering*, 2024. (Data available upon request)

2. **EEG Dataset from Patient #2**:
   > Yinzhe Wu et al. "Real-Time Non-Invasive Imaging and Detection of Spreading Depolarizations through EEG: An Ultra-Light Explainable Deep Learning Approach." *IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering*, 2024. (Data available upon request)

After gathering this information, I will prepare the dataset entries in the required format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited.
