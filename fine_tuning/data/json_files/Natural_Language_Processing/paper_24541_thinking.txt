To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Sparse deep neural networks for nonparametric estimation in high-dimensional sparse regression" by Dongya Wu and Xin Li, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and it may mention datasets used for experiments or evaluations. 

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors often discuss the context of their research and may reference specific datasets that are relevant to their work. 

Then, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. This is where the authors typically describe the datasets they used for their experiments, including details such as the number of samples, features, and any specific characteristics of the datasets.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets.

For this paper, I will look for any datasets mentioned, such as:

1. **Synthetic Dataset**: If the authors generated synthetic data for their experiments, I will note the details provided about how this data was created, including any parameters or distributions used.

2. **Real-world Dataset**: If the authors used any publicly available datasets, I will extract the names and details of these datasets, including the citation information.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, I will compile the findings, ensuring that I include full citations for each dataset as per the references in the paper. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.

Finally, I will summarize the datasets in a clear format, ensuring that each dataset is described with its relevant details and citations, ready for further processing or review.
