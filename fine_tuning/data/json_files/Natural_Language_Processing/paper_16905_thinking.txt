To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Stellar: Systematic Evaluation of Human-Centric Personalized Text-to-Image Methods" by Panos Achlioptas et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors introduce a standardized dataset called **Stellar**, which is a significant indication that this is a primary dataset of interest.

Next, I will look for specific sections that detail the datasets used in the research. In this case, I will focus on the **section 3 (Personalized Text-to-Image Data)**, where the authors describe the **Stellar** dataset in detail. They mention that Stellar is comprised of 20,000 carefully curated prompts paired with images of 400 unique human identities sourced from **CelebAMask-HQ**. This section provides a clear description of the dataset's structure and purpose.

I will also check the **tables** within the paper, particularly **Table 1**, which compares Stellar with existing datasets. This table highlights the number of prompts and subjects in Stellar compared to other datasets, reinforcing its significance.

Now, I will gather the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. **Stellar Dataset**: The authors describe it as a large-scale multimodal dataset with prompts of imaginary human-centric depictions. The citation for the Stellar dataset is:
   > Panos Achlioptas, Alexandros Benetatos, Iordanis Fostiropoulos, and Dimitris Skourtis. *Stellar: Systematic Evaluation of Human-Centric Personalized Text-to-Image Methods*. In Proceedings of the Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2023.

2. **CelebAMask-HQ**: This dataset is used for the images of human identities in Stellar. The citation for CelebAMask-HQ is:
   > Ziwei Liu, Ping Luo, Xiaogang Wang, and Xiaoou Tang. *Deep Learning Face Attributes in the Wild*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2015.

After identifying these datasets and their citations, I will compile the information into a structured format for further processing or review.

In summary, I will ensure to extract the datasets mentioned in the paper, focusing on their descriptions and full citations, which are crucial for proper referencing in any subsequent work.
