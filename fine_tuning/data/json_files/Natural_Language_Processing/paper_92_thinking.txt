To extract datasets from the research paper titled "EVE: Explainable Vector Based Embedding Technique Using Wikipedia" by M. Atif Qureshi and Derek Greene, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract and introduction** sections to get an overview of the paper's objectives and the context in which datasets are mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their model using a dataset constructed from the 2015 English-language Wikipedia dump, which is a significant clue.

Next, I will look into **section 4 (Evaluation)**, where the authors describe their experimental setup. In this section, they mention constructing a new dataset composed of seven different topical types, each containing at least five sub-topical categories. This section is likely to provide detailed information about the dataset used for evaluation.

In **subsection 4.2 (Dataset)**, the authors provide a summary of the dataset, including its structure and content. They describe the dataset as being organized into topical types such as "Animal classes," "Cuisine," "European cities," and "Nobel laureates," with examples of categories and items within those categories. This detailed description will help in documenting the dataset accurately.

I will also check the **References section** to find any citations related to the datasets mentioned. However, since the dataset is constructed from Wikipedia, it may not have a formal citation like other datasets. Instead, I will note that the dataset is derived from the 2015 English-language Wikipedia dump.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring to include the full citation for the dataset as follows:

1. **Wikipedia Dataset**: The dataset is constructed from the complete 2015 English-language Wikipedia dump, which includes various topical types and categories.

The citation for the dataset will be:
> Qureshi, M. A., & Greene, D. (2023). EVE: Explainable Vector Based Embedding Technique Using Wikipedia. *Journal of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery*. Retrieved from http://mlg.ucd.ie/eve

After gathering all this information, I will ensure that the dataset entries are clearly documented, including the dataset name, description, and citation, ready for any further processing or review.
