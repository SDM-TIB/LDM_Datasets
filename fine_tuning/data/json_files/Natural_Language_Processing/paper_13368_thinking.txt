To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards a Holistic Approach: Understanding Sociodemographic Biases in NLP Models using an Interdisciplinary Lens" by Pranav Narayanan Venkit, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to look for any references to datasets. The abstract provides a general overview, but I need to focus on sections that detail the research methods and findings.

In the **introduction**, the author discusses the importance of understanding bias in NLP models and mentions the creation of the **Bias Identification Test in Sentiment (BITS) corpus**. This indicates that a dataset has been developed specifically for the research.

Next, I will check the **methodology or experiments sections** for more details about the BITS corpus. The author states that the BITS corpus was created to quantify explicit sociodemographic bias in sentiment analysis and toxicity analysis models. This section will likely provide insights into the dataset's structure, size, and purpose.

I will also look for any references to other datasets used in the research. The author mentions using various AI-as-a-Service (AIaaS) sentiment analysis tools and toxicity analysis models, but I need to confirm if these tools are based on specific datasets or if they are standalone models.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **references section** to find full citations for the BITS corpus and any other datasets mentioned. The BITS corpus is linked to a GitHub repository, which may provide additional context or citation information.

The citation for the BITS corpus is:
> Pranav Narayanan Venkit. *Bias Identification Test in Sentiment (BITS) corpus*. Available at: https://github.com/PranavNV/BITS.

If there are any other datasets mentioned in the references, I will extract their citations as well.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including their names, descriptions, and citations, ensuring that each entry is complete and accurately reflects the content of the paper. This will prepare the dataset entries for further processing or review.
