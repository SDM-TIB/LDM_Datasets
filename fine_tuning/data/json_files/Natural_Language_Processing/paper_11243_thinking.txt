To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Model-Based Deep Learning" by Nir Shlezinger and Yonina C. Eldar, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract and introduction** sections of the paper. These sections often provide a summary of the research and may mention any datasets used in the study. I will look for any explicit references to datasets or benchmarks.

Next, I will proceed to the **methodology and experiments sections**. These sections typically contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used for training and testing the models. I will pay close attention to any subsections that discuss data collection, dataset characteristics, and how the datasets were utilized in the experiments.

I will also check the **results section** for any mentions of datasets, especially if the authors discuss performance metrics or comparisons based on different datasets. This can provide additional context about the datasets used.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **references section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. It is crucial to ensure that I have the correct and complete citation information, including authors, title, publication venue, and year.

For example, if I find that the authors used the "MNIST dataset" for their experiments, I will look for the original citation for the MNIST dataset, which is:

> Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation.

Finally, I will format the extracted information in a structured manner, ready for further processing or review. This structured output will include all relevant details about each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring that the citations are complete and accurate.
