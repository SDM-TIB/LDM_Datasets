To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Generalizing 6-DoF Grasp Detection via Domain Prior Knowledge" by Haoxiang Ma et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of the **GraspNet-1billion benchmark** for extensive experiments, indicating that this is a key dataset.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for any additional datasets or details about the GraspNet-1billion benchmark. The introduction emphasizes the challenges of grasp detection and mentions the benchmark as a significant resource for evaluating their method.

In the **experiments section**, specifically **section 4.1**, the authors provide detailed information about the GraspNet-1billion benchmark. They describe it as a large-scale dataset that includes 190 cluttered scenes, with 100 scenes for training and 90 for testing. This section confirms that the GraspNet-1billion benchmark is the primary dataset used in their experiments.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the GraspNet-1billion benchmark. The citation is as follows:
> Haoshu Fang, Chenxi Wang, Minghao Gou, and Cewu Lu. *GraspNet-1billion: A large-scale benchmark for general object grasping*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 1-10, 2020.

Additionally, the authors mention using objects from the **Dex-Net** and **YCB dataset** for real-world evaluations. I will look for these datasets in the references as well.

For the **Dex-Net**, the citation is:
> Jeffrey Mahler, Jacky Liang, Sherdil Niyaz, Michael Laskey, Richard Doan, Xinyu Liu, Juan Aparicio Ojea, and Ken Goldberg. *Dex-net 2.0: Deep learning to plan robust grasps with synthetic point clouds and analytic grasp metrics*. In Robotics: Science and Systems, 2017.

For the **YCB dataset**, the citation is:
> Berk Çalli, Arjun Singh, James Bruce, Aaron Walsman, Kurt Konolige, Siddhartha S. Srinivasa, Pieter Abbeel, and Aaron M. Dollar. *Yale-CMU-Berkeley dataset for robotic manipulation*. International Journal of Robotics Research, 36(3):261–268, 2017.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will summarize the findings:

1. **GraspNet-1billion**: A large-scale benchmark for general object grasping.
   - Citation: Haoshu Fang, Chenxi Wang, Minghao Gou, and Cewu Lu. *GraspNet-1billion: A large-scale benchmark for general object grasping*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 1-10, 2020.

2. **Dex-Net**: A dataset for planning robust grasps.
   - Citation: Jeffrey Mahler, Jacky Liang, Sherdil Niyaz, Michael Laskey, Richard Doan, Xinyu Liu, Juan Aparicio Ojea, and Ken Goldberg. *Dex-net 2.0: Deep learning to plan robust grasps with synthetic point clouds and analytic grasp metrics*. In Robotics: Science and Systems, 2017.

3. **YCB dataset**: A dataset for robotic manipulation.
   - Citation: Berk Çalli, Arjun Singh, James Bruce, Aaron Walsman, Kurt Konolige, Siddhartha S. Srinivasa, Pieter Abbeel, and Aaron M. Dollar. *Yale-CMU-Berkeley dataset for robotic manipulation*. International Journal of Robotics Research, 36(3):261–268, 2017.

With this information, I can now compile the dataset entries for further processing or review.
