To extract datasets from the research paper titled "WojoodNER 2024: The Second Arabic Named Entity Recognition Shared Task" by Mustafa Jarrar et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that a new Arabic fine-grained NER dataset called **WojoodFine** is introduced, which is a strong indication that this dataset is central to the research.

Next, I will look into **section 4 (Datasets and Evaluation Metrics)**, as this section is likely to provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the shared task. Here, I find that the paper discusses two main datasets:

1. **WojoodFine**: This dataset is described as an enhanced version of the original Wojood corpus, containing approximately 550k tokens annotated with 51 entity types and subtypes. It is used for the Closed-Track Flat Fine-Grained NER and Closed-Track Nested Fine-Grained NER subtasks.

2. **WojoodGaza**: This dataset is specifically curated for the Open-Track NER related to the Israeli War on Gaza. It includes 60k tokens collected from various news domains, with a development dataset of 10k tokens and a testing dataset of 50k tokens.

In the same section, the authors provide a breakdown of how the datasets are structured and the specific splits for training, development, and testing.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets:

- For **WojoodFine**, the citation is:
  > Liqreina, H., Jarrar, M., Khalilia, M., El-Shangiti, A. O., & Abdul-Mageed, M. (2023). Wojood: Nested Arabic Named Entity Corpus and Recognition using BERT. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC 2022), Marseille, France.

- For **WojoodGaza**, while it may not have a separate citation in the references, it is mentioned in the context of the shared task and is based on the same annotation guidelines as WojoodFine.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and includes the full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
