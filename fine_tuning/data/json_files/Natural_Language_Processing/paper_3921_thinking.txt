To extract datasets from the research paper titled "How to Split: the Effect of Word Segmentation on Gender Bias in Speech Translation" by Marco Gaido et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of gender bias in translation technologies, which suggests that datasets are likely involved. The introduction further emphasizes the focus on gender bias in translation tools, hinting at the presence of specific datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments** section. In this paper, the authors mention two key datasets:

1. **MuST-C Corpus**: This is a multilingual corpus for end-to-end speech translation, which contains 492 hours of speech for English-French and 465 hours for English-Italian. It serves as the training data for their experiments.

2. **MuST-SHE**: This is a gender-sensitive benchmark derived from the MuST-C corpus, specifically designed to evaluate gender translation. It consists of 1,113 sentences for English-French and 1,096 sentences for English-Italian.

I will then check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **MuST-C Corpus**:

- For **MuST-SHE**:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and that the full citations are included. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
