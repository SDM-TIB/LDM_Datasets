To extract datasets from the research paper titled "GreenEVT: Greensboro Electric Vehicle Testbed" by Gustav Nilsson et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract and introduction** sections to get an overview of the datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the paper presents an open-source testbed that utilizes high-fidelity models of both the electric distribution system and the transportation network. This suggests that there are datasets related to both systems.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **methodology and results sections**. In the **Testbed Components** section, the authors describe the datasets used for the electric distribution system and the transportation network. 

1. **SMART-DS Dataset**: This dataset is mentioned as a source of high-fidelity electric distribution system data for Greensboro, NC. The authors describe it as a large-scale, realistic-but-not-real electric distribution model that captures electrical connections down to individual households. 

2. **OpenStreetMap Data**: The paper states that the transportation network data was imported from OpenStreetMap, which provides detailed road and traffic information for the city.

3. **Parcel Data**: The authors mention using publicly available parcel data from the state of North Carolina, which includes information on the location and usage of parcels in Greensboro.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **SMART-DS Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Palmintier, B., Elgindy, T., Mateo, C., Postigo, F., GÃ³mez, T., de Cuadra, F., & Martinez, P. D. (2021). Experiences developing large-scale synthetic US-style distribution test systems. *Electric Power Systems Research*, 190, 106665. https://www.nrel.gov/grid/smart-ds.html.

- For the **OpenStreetMap Data**, while it may not have a formal citation in the references, I can note that it is a widely recognized open-source mapping project. A general citation could be:
  > OpenStreetMap contributors. (n.d.). OpenStreetMap. Retrieved from https://www.openstreetmap.org.

- For the **Parcel Data**, the citation can be referenced as:
  > North Carolina Department of Transportation. (n.d.). Parcel data. Retrieved from https://www.nconemap.gov/pages/parcels.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited. This structured approach will help in accurately documenting the datasets used in the research paper for future reference or analysis.
