To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SiLLM: Large Language Models for Simultaneous Machine Translation" by Shoutao Guo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

Step 1: I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that experiments were conducted on two datasets, which suggests that they are important for the research.

Step 2: Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used in their experiments. This section typically provides the most detailed information about the datasets, including their names, sizes, and any relevant characteristics.

Step 3: In section 4.1, I find two datasets mentioned:

1. **WMT15 German→English (De→En)**: This dataset consists of 4.5 million parallel sentence pairs. The authors mention that they randomly sampled 100,000 sentence pairs for fine-tuning their model and specify the validation and test sets used.

2. **MuST-C English→German (En→De)**: This dataset contains 230,000 samples and is used for translation tasks. Similar to the WMT15 dataset, the authors state that they randomly sampled 100,000 samples for fine-tuning and mention the validation and test sets.

Step 4: I will now look at the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets.

- For the **WMT15 dataset**, the citation is:
  > Myle Ott, Sergey Edunov, Alexei Baevski, Angela Fan, Sam Gross, Nathan Ng, David Grangier, and Michael Auli. *fairseq: A fast, extensible toolkit for sequence modeling*. In Proceedings of the 2019 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, NAACL-HLT 2019, Minneapolis, MN, USA, June 2-7, 2019, Demonstrations, pages 48–53. Association for Computational Linguistics.

- For the **MuST-C dataset**, the citation is:
  > Mattia A. Di Gangi, Roldano Cattoni, Luisa Bentivogli, Matteo Negri, and Marco Turchi. *MuST-C: a Multilingual Speech Translation Corpus*. In Proceedings of the 2019 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, Volume 1 (Long and Short Papers), pages 2012–2017, Minneapolis, Minnesota. Association for Computational Linguistics.

Step 5: Finally, I will compile the extracted dataset information, including their descriptions and full citations, ensuring that I adhere to the required format for clarity and completeness.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets used in the research paper, providing a comprehensive overview for future reference.
