To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On The Cross-Modal Transfer from Natural Language to Code through Adapter Modules" by Divyam Goel et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets used for training or evaluation.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experimental Setup)**, particularly **subsection 4.2 (Datasets and Tasks)**, where the authors detail the datasets used for training the L-adapters and for the tasks of cloze test and code clone detection. Here, I will find specific datasets mentioned:

1. **CodeNet (CN)**: This dataset is described as a large-scale, high-quality dataset collected for studies of artificial intelligence for code. The authors mention that it is used to train L-adapters for programming languages.

2. **CodeSearchNet (CSN)**: This dataset is a joint effort from GitHub and Microsoft Research, consisting of code and comment pairs in multiple programming languages. It is also used for training L-adapters.

3. **POJ-104**: This dataset is used for code clone detection, containing C/C++ programs.

4. **Big Clone Bench (BCB)**: Another dataset for code clone detection, which is evaluated using F1 scores.

5. **SCD-88**: A Python-specific subset of the cross-language clone detection dataset, used for evaluating code clone detection.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The citations I will look for are:

- For **CodeNet**, I will find the citation:
  > Ruchir Puri et al. *Project CodeNet: A Large-Scale AI for Code Dataset for Learning a Diversity of Coding Tasks*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2105.12655, 2021.

- For **CodeSearchNet**, the citation is:
  > Hamel Husain et al. *CodeSearchNet Challenge: Evaluating the State of Semantic Code Search*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1909.09436, 2020.

- For **POJ-104**, I will find the citation:
  > Daniel Perez and Shigeru Chiba. *Cross-language clone detection by learning over abstract syntax trees*. In 2019 IEEE/ACM 16th International Conference on Mining Software Repositories (MSR), 2019.

- For **Big Clone Bench (BCB)**, I will find the citation:
  > Xin Wang et al. *CLSEBERT: Contrastive Learning for Syntax Enhanced Code Pre-Trained Model*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2108.04556, 2021.

- For **SCD-88**, I will find the citation:
  > Daniel Perez and Shigeru Chiba. *Cross-language clone detection by learning over abstract syntax trees*. In 2019 IEEE/ACM 16th International Conference on Mining Software Repositories (MSR), 2019.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries along with their full citations for clarity and completeness. This structured approach ensures that I do not miss any important details regarding the datasets used in the research.
