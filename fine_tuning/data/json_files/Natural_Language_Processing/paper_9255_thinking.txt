To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "CCDN: Checkerboard Corner Detection Network for Robust Camera Calibration" by Ben Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant details, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and datasets sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions evaluations on two different datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Datasets)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for training and testing their model. They mention that the training dataset consists of images captured directly and digitally augmented versions of these images. They also specify that they used four types of checkerboards for calibration patterns, which were placed under various conditions to create a diverse dataset of 8900 images, with 8000 used for training and the remainder for validation.

The authors also detail the testing datasets, which include the **uEye dataset** and the **GoPro dataset**. The uEye dataset is noted for its slight lens distortion and is used to evaluate robustness against perspective transforms and noise. The GoPro dataset is down-sampled and used to assess robustness against lens distortion.

Now, I will look for the full citations of these datasets in the **References section** of the paper. The uEye dataset is referenced in the context of the ROCHADE paper, and the GoPro dataset is also associated with the same reference.

The citations I need to extract are:

1. **uEye Dataset**: This dataset is referenced in the context of the ROCHADE paper, which is:
   > Placht, S. et al. *ROCHADE: Robust checkerboard advanced detection for camera calibration*. In: Computer Vision - ECCV 2014: 13th European Conference, Zurich, Switzerland, 6–12 September, Proceedings, Part IV, pp. 766–779 (2014).

2. **GoPro Dataset**: This dataset is also referenced in the same ROCHADE paper:
   > Placht, S. et al. *ROCHADE: Robust checkerboard advanced detection for camera calibration*. In: Computer Vision - ECCV 2014: 13th European Conference, Zurich, Switzerland, 6–12 September, Proceedings, Part IV, pp. 766–779 (2014).

Since both datasets are derived from the same source, I will ensure to note that they are both cited from the ROCHADE paper.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.
