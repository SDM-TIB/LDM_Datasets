To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Phoneme-Based Contextualization for Cross-Lingual Speech Recognition in End-to-End Models" by Ke Hu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information and provide full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract discusses the challenges of recognizing rare named entities in foreign languages, which suggests that datasets related to speech recognition and possibly foreign language utterances may be involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, specifically **subsection 4.1 (Data Sets)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention two key datasets:

1. **Training Set**: This dataset contains 35 million English utterances, amounting to around 27,500 hours of data. It is sourced from Googleâ€™s general English traffic and is anonymized and hand-transcribed for training purposes.

2. **Directions Test Set**: This dataset consists of 1,000 synthesized utterances in French, specifically designed for evaluating the model's performance on navigation queries. The authors refer to this as the Directions test set, which includes both the ground-truth place names and unrelated French place names.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. However, since the datasets mentioned are not standalone datasets published in separate papers, I will provide a description of the datasets based on the information given in the paper.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their descriptions and ensure that I include the context in which they were used in the experiments. The citations for the datasets will be based on the context provided in the paper rather than traditional references, as they are not formally published datasets.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for review or further processing, ensuring that all relevant details are captured accurately.
