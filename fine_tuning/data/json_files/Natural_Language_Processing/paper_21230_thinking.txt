To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "Forget NLI, Use a Dictionary: Zero-Shot Topic Classification for Low-Resource Languages with Application to Luxembourgish" by Fred Philippy et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and dataset sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors constructed two new topic relevance classification datasets based on a dictionary, which suggests that these datasets are central to their research.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Our Dataset)**, where the authors describe the datasets in detail. They mention that they created two datasets based on a publicly available online dictionary:

1. **LETZ-SYN**: This dataset is derived from synonyms found in the Luxembourg Online Dictionary (LOD). It includes example sentences paired with their corresponding synonyms as labels. The dataset consists of 11,822 training samples, 1,478 validation samples, and 1,478 test samples.

2. **LETZ-WoT**: This dataset is based on word translations available in the same dictionary. It is structured similarly to LETZ-SYN, with a balanced number of "entailment" and "non-entailment" samples. The dataset includes 39,132 training samples, 4,892 validation samples, and 4,892 test samples.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will check the **References section**. The authors mention that the datasets are based on the Luxembourg Online Dictionary, which is publicly available under a Creative Commons Zero (CC0) license. However, they do not provide a specific citation for the dictionary itself in the references.

For the datasets, I will cite them as follows:

- For **LETZ-SYN** and **LETZ-WoT**, since they are newly created datasets based on the Luxembourg Online Dictionary, I will reference the paper itself as the source of these datasets:

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their descriptions and citations into a structured format for further processing. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the necessary information regarding the datasets used in this research paper.
