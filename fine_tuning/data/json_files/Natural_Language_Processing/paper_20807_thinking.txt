To extract datasets from the research paper titled "PlainMamba: Improving Non-Hierarchical Mamba in Visual Recognition" by Chenhongyi Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate PlainMamba on various visual recognition tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved. I will look for specific mentions of datasets in these sections.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**. This section typically contains detailed information about the datasets used for training and evaluation. I will look for any tables or text that explicitly list the datasets, their sizes, and any relevant characteristics.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **ImageNet-1K**: This dataset is widely used for image classification tasks and contains 1,000 classes with over 1.2 million images. It is a standard benchmark in the field of computer vision.

2. **COCO (Common Objects in Context)**: This dataset is used for object detection and instance segmentation tasks. It contains over 330,000 images, with more than 200,000 labeled images and 80 object categories.

3. **ADE20K**: This dataset is used for semantic segmentation tasks. It contains over 20,000 images with pixel-level annotations across 150 object categories.

Now, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

- For **ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Deng, J., Dong, W., Socher, R., Li, L.J., Li, K., & Fei-Fei, L. (2009). *ImageNet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In 2009 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 248–255.

- For **COCO**, the citation is:
  > Lin, T.Y., Maire, M., Belongie, S., Hays, J., Perona, P., Ramanan, D., Dollár, P., & Zitnick, C.L. (2014). *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. In European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), 740–755.

- For **ADE20K**, the citation is:
  > Zhou, B., Zhao, H., Puig, X., Fidler, S., Barriuso, A., & Torralba, A. (2017). *Scene parsing through ADE20K dataset*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2017, 2017–2026.

With these citations in hand, I will compile the dataset information, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that I adhere to the required format for clarity and completeness.
