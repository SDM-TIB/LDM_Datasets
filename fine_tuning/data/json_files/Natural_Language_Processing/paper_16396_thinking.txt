To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Speech-Based Blood Pressure Estimation with Enhanced Optimization and Incremental Clustering" by Vaishali Rajput et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of a real-time dataset consisting of Blood Pressure values and corresponding voice signals collected from participants, which indicates that a dataset is indeed present.

Next, I will look for specific details about the dataset in the **methodology section**. Here, the authors describe the dataset as consisting of Blood Pressure values and voice signals from 25 participants aged 20 to 65, with a breakdown of gender and the impact of Blood Pressure on some participants. This section provides key information about the dataset's composition.

In the **dataset description**, the authors provide further details, including the types of measurements (Systolic and Diastolic values) and the recording devices used (Boya BY-M1 Omni directional microphone and Omron hem 7120 Blood Pressure monitor). This information is crucial for understanding the dataset's context and application.

I will also check the **results section** to see if there are any additional datasets mentioned or referenced. However, the primary dataset appears to be the one described in the methodology.

Now, I will compile the full citation for the dataset mentioned in the paper. Since the dataset is based on original data collected by the authors, I will cite it as follows:

- **Real-time dataset for Blood Pressure estimation**:
  > Rajput, V., Mulay, P., & Raje, R. (2023). *Speech-Based Blood Pressure Estimation with Enhanced Optimization and Incremental Clustering*. Symbiosis Institute of Technology, Symbiosis International (Deemed University), Pune, India.

Finally, I will summarize the dataset information in a structured manner, ensuring that I include the full citation as required. This will allow for clear documentation and reference for future use or analysis.
