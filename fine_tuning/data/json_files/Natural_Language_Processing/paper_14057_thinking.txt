To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Using AI Uncertainty Quantification to Improve Human Decision-Making" by Laura R. Marusich et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted two online behavioral experiments and mentions the use of "three different publicly-available and widely-used datasets." This suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Current Work)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used in their experiments. They mention three datasets:

1. **Census Dataset**: This dataset contains 48,842 instances and 14 attributes. The authors note that missing values were replaced with the mode, and dollar amounts were adjusted for inflation.

2. **German Credit Dataset**: This dataset consists of 1,000 instances and 20 attributes, with currency values converted to dollars and adjusted for inflation.

3. **Student Performance Dataset**: This dataset has 649 instances and 33 attributes. The authors combined three attributes (first period grade, second period grade, and final grade) into one average grade.

The authors also mention that each dataset was split into training (70%) and test (30%) data sets, which is important for understanding how the datasets were utilized in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The paper cites the UCI Machine Learning Repository as the source for all three datasets. The citation for the repository is:

- **UCI Machine Learning Repository**: 
  > Dua, D., & Graff, C. (2017). UCI Machine Learning Repository. Retrieved from http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml.

Since all three datasets are from the same source, I will use this citation for each dataset entry.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This will provide a clear and organized summary of the datasets used in the research.

After completing this process, I will have a structured output ready for review or further processing.
