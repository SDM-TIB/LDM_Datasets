To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Generative Human Motion Stylization in Latent Space" by Chuan Guo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, but I will pay particular attention to the **experiments section**, as it typically contains detailed information about the datasets used for evaluation.

In the **experiments section**, the authors mention that they adopt three datasets for comprehensive evaluation:

1. **Aberman et al. (2020)**: This dataset is described as a widely used motion style dataset containing 16 distinct style labels, with a total duration of 193 minutes. This indicates that it is a significant dataset for motion stylization tasks.

2. **Xia et al. (2015)**: This dataset is noted to be a smaller motion style collection with a total duration of 25 minutes, captured in 8 styles, and includes accurate action type annotations for 8 actions. The authors mention that the motions are typically shorter than 3 seconds, which is relevant for understanding the dataset's characteristics.

3. **CMU Mocap (CMU)**: This dataset is described as an unlabeled dataset with high diversity and quantity of motion data. The authors specify that all motion data is retargeted to the same 21-joint skeleton structure, with a 10% held-out subset for evaluation.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Aberman et al. (2020)**, the citation is:
  > Kfir Aberman, Yijia Weng, Dani Lischinski, Daniel Cohen-Or, and Baoquan Chen. *Unpaired motion style transfer from video to animation*. ACM Transactions on Graphics (TOG), 39(4):64–1, 2020.

- For **Xia et al. (2015)**, the citation is:
  > Shihong Xia, Congyi Wang, Jinxiang Chai, and Jessica Hodgins. *Realtime style transfer for unlabeled heterogeneous human motion*. ACM Transactions on Graphics (TOG), 34(4):1–10, 2015.

- For **CMU Mocap**, the citation is:
  > Carnegie-Mellon University. *Carnegie-mellon mocap database*. Retrieved from http://mocap.cs.cmu.edu.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use. Each dataset will be clearly described along with its citation, ensuring that all necessary details are included for proper referencing.
