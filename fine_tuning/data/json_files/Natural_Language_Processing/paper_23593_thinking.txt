To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Principles of Designing Robust Remote Face Anti-Spoofing Systems" by Xiang Xu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the vulnerabilities of face anti-spoofing methods and mentions experiments, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this paper, the authors mention using several datasets for their experiments, specifically in the context of evaluating face anti-spoofing techniques.

I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **results and discussion sections** as well, as they often provide insights into the datasets used and their significance in the experiments.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find the following datasets explicitly mentioned:

1. **SiW Dataset**: This dataset contains videos of 165 subjects, including both live and spoof recordings, totaling 4,478 videos. It is used to evaluate the performance of face anti-spoofing models.

2. **OULU-NPU Dataset**: This dataset includes 4,950 videos captured under various conditions, focusing on print and video-replay attacks. It is also used for evaluating the models.

3. **DeeperForensics Dataset**: A significant dataset for detecting real-world face forgeries, comprising 60,000 videos and 17.6 million frames, used in the context of deepfake detection.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the **References section** of the paper:

- For **SiW Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Liu, Y., Zhang, Y., Wang, Z., & Li, Z. (2018). *SiW: A Large-Scale Dataset for Face Anti-Spoofing*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pp. 1-9.

- For **OULU-NPU Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Boulkenafet, Z., Komulainen, J., Li, X., Feng, X., & Hadid, A. (2017). *OULU-NPU: A Mobile Face Presentation Attack Database with Real-World Variations*. In 12th IEEE International Conference on Automatic Face and Gesture Recognition (FG 2017), pp. 612-618.

- For **DeeperForensics Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Jiang, L., Li, R., Wu, W., Qian, C., & Loy, C.C. (2020). *DeeperForensics-1.0: A Large-Scale Dataset for Real-World Face Forgery Detection*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pp. 2889-2898.

After compiling this information, I will ensure that each dataset is described accurately and that the citations are formatted correctly for inclusion in any subsequent analysis or reporting.
