To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Images Speak Louder than Words: Understanding and Mitigating Bias in Vision-Language Model from a Causal Mediation Perspective" by Zhaotian Weng et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on the **MSCOCO** and **PASCAL-SENTENCE** datasets, which suggests that these datasets are central to their research.

Next, I will look for specific details about these datasets in the **experimental setup section**. The authors mention that they conducted their experiments on the **MSCOCO** dataset, which is described as containing images and annotations for object detection tasks. They also refer to the **PASCAL-SENTENCE** dataset, which includes images annotated with captions, and they explain how they annotated gender labels based on the captions.

In the **results section**, the authors provide insights into the performance metrics and bias measurements for both datasets, confirming their use in the experiments. This reinforces that both datasets are indeed utilized for their analysis.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **MSCOCO dataset**, the citation is:
   > Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, Serge Belongie, James Hays, Pietro Perona, Deva Ramanan, Piotr Dollár, and C Lawrence Zitnick. *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. In Computer Vision–ECCV 2014: 13th European Conference, Zurich, Switzerland, September 6-12, 2014, Proceedings, Part V 13, pages 740–755. Springer.

2. For the **PASCAL-SENTENCE dataset**, the citation is:
   > Cyrus Rashtchian, Peter Young, Micah Hodosh, and Julia Hockenmaier. *Collecting Image Annotations Using Amazon’s Mechanical Turk*. In Proceedings of the NAACL HLT 2010 Workshop on Creating Speech and Language Data with Amazon’s Mechanical Turk, pages 139–147.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

- **MSCOCO**: A large-scale dataset for object detection, containing images and annotations for various objects.
- **PASCAL-SENTENCE**: A dataset that includes images with associated captions, annotated for gender based on the content of the captions.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
