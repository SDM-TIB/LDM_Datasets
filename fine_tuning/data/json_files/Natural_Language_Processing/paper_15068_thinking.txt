To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An Online Learning Theory of Brokerage" by Nataˇsa Boli´c et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, but it may not contain specific dataset names. The introduction often discusses the context and relevance of the research, which might include references to datasets used in prior work.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments or results sections**. This is typically where authors describe the datasets they used for their experiments. If the paper includes a section specifically titled "Datasets" or "Data Collection," I will pay close attention to that section for detailed descriptions.

If the datasets are not explicitly named in the earlier sections, I will check the **related work section** to see if the authors reference datasets used in previous studies. This can provide clues about the datasets relevant to their research.

Once I identify the datasets, I will ensure to note down the following details for each dataset:
1. **Name of the dataset**: The official name as mentioned in the paper.
2. **Description**: A brief overview of what the dataset contains, including the type of data, size, and any relevant characteristics.
3. **Citation**: The full citation for the dataset, which may involve looking up the original source if it is not provided in the paper.

For example, if the authors mention using a dataset like the "XYZ Dataset," I will look for the citation in the references section of the paper or search for it online to find the original publication or source.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and citation in a clear and organized manner.

Finally, I will review the entire process to ensure that no datasets have been overlooked and that all citations are accurate and complete.
