To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Physically Plausible Full-Body Hand-Object Interaction Synthesis" by Jona Braun et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and while it may not explicitly mention datasets, it can hint at their existence. The introduction often discusses related works and may reference datasets used in prior research.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for training and evaluation. In this paper, the authors mention using the **GRAB dataset** for training their model. I will look for specific details about this dataset, such as its purpose, size, and any unique characteristics that are relevant to the study.

In the **experiments section**, the authors state: "We train and evaluate our model using the GRAB dataset [45] where we follow the right-handed grasp setting." This confirms that the GRAB dataset is indeed used in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the GRAB dataset. The citation provided in the references is:
> Omid Taheri, Nima Ghorbani, Michael J. Black, and Dimitrios Tzionas. *GRAB: A dataset of whole-body human grasping of objects*. In European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), 2020.

Next, I will also look for any other datasets mentioned in the paper. The authors compare their method against other baselines, specifically mentioning the **GOAL dataset** and the **IMoS dataset**. I will extract details about these datasets as well.

For the **GOAL dataset**, the citation is:
> Omid Taheri, Vasileios Choutas, Michael J. Black, and Dimitrios Tzionas. *GOAL: Generating 4D whole-body motion for hand-object grasping*. In Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2022.

For the **IMoS dataset**, the citation is:
> Anindita Ghosh, Rishabh Dabral, Vladislav Golyanik, Christian Theobalt, and Philipp Slusallek. *IMOS: Intent-driven full-body motion synthesis for human-object interactions*. In Eurographics, 2023.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will summarize the findings:

1. **GRAB Dataset**: Used for training the model.
   - Citation: Omid Taheri, Nima Ghorbani, Michael J. Black, and Dimitrios Tzionas. *GRAB: A dataset of whole-body human grasping of objects*. In European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), 2020.

2. **GOAL Dataset**: Used for comparison in the approaching phase.
   - Citation: Omid Taheri, Vasileios Choutas, Michael J. Black, and Dimitrios Tzionas. *GOAL: Generating 4D whole-body motion for hand-object grasping*. In Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2022.

3. **IMoS Dataset**: Used for comparison in the manipulation phase.
   - Citation: Anindita Ghosh, Rishabh Dabral, Vladislav Golyanik, Christian Theobalt, and Philipp Slusallek. *IMOS: Intent-driven full-body motion synthesis for human-object interactions*. In Eurographics, 2023.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
