To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Mathematical models of Plasmodium vivax transmission: a scoping review" by Md Nurul Anwar et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on mathematical models for P. vivax transmission, but it does not explicitly mention datasets. The introduction may provide context or references to specific datasets used in the models discussed.

Next, I will examine the **methods section**, which outlines the literature search conducted for the review. This section may include details about the datasets used in the studies reviewed. I will look for any specific datasets mentioned in the context of the mathematical models analyzed.

In the **results section**, I will look for any tables or figures that summarize the datasets used in the studies included in the review. This section may provide a comprehensive list of datasets along with their characteristics.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the studies.

For example, if I find that the paper references the following datasets:

1. **Plasmodium vivax malaria transmission model datasets**: These datasets may include various parameters and results from the mathematical models discussed in the paper.

2. **Hypnozoite dynamics datasets**: These datasets may include information on the activation and clearance of hypnozoites as discussed in the models.

I will then look for the original studies that provided these datasets and extract their full citations. For instance, if the paper cites a study that developed a specific model or dataset, I will ensure to include that citation in the final output.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I accurately capture all relevant datasets and their citations from the paper.
