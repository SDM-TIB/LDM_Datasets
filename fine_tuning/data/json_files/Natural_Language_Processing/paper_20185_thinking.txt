To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "Beyond the Labels: Unveiling Text-Dependency in Paralinguistic Speech Recognition Datasets" by Jan Pešan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are mentioned. The abstract highlights the importance of datasets like **CLSE** and **IEMOCAP** in the context of paralinguistic traits, indicating that these are key datasets for the study.

Next, I will examine the **background** section, specifically subsection A, where the authors explicitly mention the two datasets:

1. **CLSE (Cognitive Load with Speech and EGG)**: This dataset is designed to recognize cognitive load through speech recordings and Electroglottograph (EGG) signals.

2. **IEMOCAP (Interactive Emotional Dyadic Motion Capture)**: This dataset consists of approximately twelve hours of scripted and spontaneous dialogues, capturing various emotions through detailed facial and hand movements.

I will also look into the **methodology** sections for both datasets to gather more details about their structure and purpose. The CLSE dataset is described in detail in section III, where it mentions the use of the Reading Span task and the total number of utterances. The IEMOCAP dataset is elaborated in section V, detailing its composition and the emotional content it captures.

To ensure I have the correct citations, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. Here are the full citations for the datasets:

- For **CLSE**, the citation is:
  > T. F. Yap, “Speech production under cognitive load: Effects and classification,” Ph.D. dissertation, The University of New South Wales, 2012.

- For **IEMOCAP**, the citation is:
  > C. Busso, M. Bulut, C.-C. Lee, A. Kazemzadeh, E. Mower, S. Kim, J. N. Chang, S. Lee, and S. S. Narayanan, “IEMOCAP: interactive emotional dyadic motion capture database,” Language Resources and Evaluation, vol. 42, no. 4, pp. 335–359, Nov. 2008. Available: https://doi.org/10.1007/s10579-008-9076-6

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into the required format for further processing. This includes ensuring that each dataset is clearly described with its purpose and citation, ready for any downstream tasks or reviews.
