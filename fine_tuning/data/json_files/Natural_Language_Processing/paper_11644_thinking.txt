To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Highly accurate and efficient deep learning paradigm for full-atom protein loop modeling with KarmaLoop" by Tianyue Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, results, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that KarmaLoop has been evaluated on multiple benchmark datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **Results and Discussion section**, particularly the subsections that discuss the performance of KarmaLoop. Here, the authors mention that KarmaLoop has been evaluated on several benchmark datasets, specifically:

1. **CASP13+14 Dataset**: This dataset is a combination of CASP13 and CASP14, containing 549 loop structures from 52 proteins.
2. **CASP15 Dataset**: This dataset includes 430 loop structures from 48 proteins.
3. **Antibody H3 Benchmark**: This benchmark is derived from DeepAb and consists of 92 antibody CDR H3 loop structures from 92 antibodies.

I will also check the **Methods section**, particularly the subsection on the benchmark dataset, to confirm the details of these datasets. The authors provide a clear description of the datasets used for evaluation, which aligns with what I found in the Results section.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. However, since these datasets are benchmarks commonly used in the field, they may not have formal citations like traditional datasets. Instead, I will note the relevant papers or sources that describe these datasets:

- For the **CASP13+14 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Kryshtafovych, A., Schwede, T., Topf, M., Fidelis, K., & Moult, J. (2019). Critical assessment of methods of protein structure prediction (CASP)-Round XIII. *Proteins*, 87(11), 1011-1020.

- For the **CASP15 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Kryshtafovych, A., Schwede, T., Topf, M., Fidelis, K., & Moult, J. (2021). Critical assessment of methods of protein structure prediction (CASP)â€”Round XIV. *Proteins*, 89(12), 1607-1617.

- For the **Antibody H3 Benchmark**, the citation is:
  > Dunbar, J. et al. (2016). SAbPred: a structure-based antibody prediction server. *Nucleic Acids Research*, 44(W474-W478).

With this information, I can now compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
