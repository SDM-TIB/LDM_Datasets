To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Global-guided Focal Neural Radiance Field for Large-scale Scene Rendering" by Mingqi Shao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors demonstrate their method on various large-scale datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors provide details about the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they explicitly mention two types of datasets: **aerial-view datasets** and **street-view datasets**. 

1. **Aerial-view datasets**:
   - **Campus Dataset**: This dataset is part of the UrbanScene3D collection and is used for evaluating the performance of their method on aerial scenes.
   - **Sci-Art Dataset**: Another dataset from UrbanScene3D, also used for aerial scene evaluation.
   - **Residence Dataset**: This dataset is included in the aerial-view evaluation and is sourced from UrbanScene3D.
   - **Rubble Dataset**: This dataset is from Mill19 and is used for aerial scene evaluation.
   - **Building Dataset**: Another dataset from Mill19, included in the aerial evaluation.

2. **Street-view datasets**:
   - **San Francisco Mission Bay Dataset**: This dataset is collected by an autonomous driving vehicle and is used for evaluating street scenes.
   - **Block_A Dataset**: A synthetic dataset from MatrixCity, used for street scene evaluation.
   - **Block_Small Dataset**: Another synthetic dataset from MatrixCity, also used for street scene evaluation.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each of these datasets. 

- For the **Campus Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Lin, L., Liu, Y., Hu, Y., Yan, X., Xie, K., Huang, H. "Capturing, reconstructing, and simulating: the urbanscene3d dataset." In European Conference on Computer Vision, pp. 93–109. Springer, 2022.

- For the **Sci-Art Dataset**, the citation is the same as the Campus Dataset since they are part of the same collection.

- For the **Residence Dataset**, the citation is also the same as the Campus Dataset.

- For the **Rubble Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Turki, H., Ramanan, D., Satyanarayanan, M. "Mega-nerf: Scalable construction of large-scale nerfs for virtual fly-throughs." In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 12922–12931, 2022.

- For the **Building Dataset**, the citation is the same as the Rubble Dataset.

- For the **San Francisco Mission Bay Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Tancik, M., Casser, V., Yan, X., Pradhan, S., Mildenhall, B., Srinivasan, P.P., Barron, J.T., Kretzschmar, H. "Block-nerf: Scalable large scene neural view synthesis." In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 8248–8258, 2022.

- For the **Block_A Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Li, Y., Jiang, L., Xu, L., Xiangli, Y., Wang, Z., Lin, D., Dai, B. "Matrixcity: A large-scale city dataset for city-scale neural rendering and beyond." In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision, pp. 3205–3215, 2023.

- For the **Block_Small Dataset**, the citation is the same as the Block_A Dataset.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries with their full citations to ensure that they are accurately represented for any further processing or review.
