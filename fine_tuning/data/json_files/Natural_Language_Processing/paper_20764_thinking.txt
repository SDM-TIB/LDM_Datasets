To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ChatPattern: Layout Pattern Customization via Natural Language" by Zixiao Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the experiments involve generating layout patterns, which suggests that datasets are likely used.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experimental Results)**, where the authors discuss the datasets used for their experiments. They state that they obtained a dataset of small layout pattern images by splitting the layout map from the ICCAD contest 2014. This indicates that there is a specific dataset being referenced.

I will look for more details about this dataset, including its size and any specific characteristics mentioned in the text. The authors specify that the dataset consists of layout patterns with a size of 2048×2048 nm², which is crucial information for understanding the dataset's context.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset mentioned. The authors refer to the ICCAD contest 2014, which is a well-known event in the field of electronic design automation. The citation for this dataset can be constructed as follows:

- For the ICCAD contest 2014 dataset, the citation is:
  > ICCAD 2014 Contest on Layout Pattern Generation. Available at: [ICCAD Contest Website](http://www.iccad.com/).

Since the dataset is derived from a contest, it may not have a traditional citation format like a journal article, but the contest website serves as a valid reference.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This will ensure that the datasets are properly documented for future reference or analysis.
