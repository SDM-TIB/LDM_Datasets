To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Empirical Analysis of AI-based Energy Management in Electric Vehicles: A Case Study on Reinforcement Learning" by Jincheng Hu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study but does not explicitly mention any datasets. The introduction may provide context or references to datasets used in previous studies, which could be helpful.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section IV), as this is where datasets are most likely to be detailed. I will look for any specific mentions of datasets used for training or testing the reinforcement learning models. The authors may describe the datasets in terms of their characteristics, size, and the context in which they were used.

In this paper, the authors mention using the **Worldwide Harmonized Light Duty Driving Test Cycle (WLTC)** as a simulation environment for their experiments. This is a significant dataset as it provides standardized driving conditions for evaluating the performance of energy management strategies in electric vehicles.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the WLTC dataset. The citation for the WLTC is:
> Tutuianu, Monica, et al. "Development of a World-wide Worldwide harmonized Light duty driving Test Cycle (WLTC)." Technical Report (2013).

After identifying the WLTC dataset, I will ensure to document it properly, including its relevance to the study and any specific details provided by the authors regarding its use.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation, as this is crucial for proper attribution and further research.

In summary, the key steps are:
1. Read the abstract, introduction, and methodology sections for context.
2. Focus on the experiments section to identify datasets.
3. Document the **WLTC dataset** and its citation.
4. Compile the information for clarity and completeness.
