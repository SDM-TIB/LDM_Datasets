To extract datasets from the research paper titled "BET: Explaining Deep Reinforcement Learning through The Error-Prone Decisions" by Xiao Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a high-level overview of the research, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets used for evaluation or experimentation.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used in their evaluations. I will look for any specific datasets mentioned, including their characteristics and the context in which they were used.

In this paper, the authors mention evaluating their method on various tasks, including classic RL games and complex multi-agent environments. I will note any datasets that are explicitly named or described in this context.

I will also check the **related works section** (section 2) for any references to datasets that may have been used in prior research, as this can provide context for the datasets used in this study.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets.

For example, if the paper mentions using the **Lunar Lander** dataset, I will look for the original source or paper that introduced this dataset and note its citation. Similarly, if the **StarCraft II** environment is mentioned, I will find the relevant citation for that as well.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation.

Finally, I will organize this information clearly, ready for presentation or further processing, ensuring that all citations are accurate and complete.
