To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ProLLM: Protein Chain-of-Thoughts Enhanced LLM for Protein-Protein Interaction Prediction" by Mingyu Jin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors demonstrate the efficacy of their method through validation against benchmark datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention evaluating their method on four widely used PPI datasets: **Human**, **SHS27K**, **SHS148K**, and **STRING**. This is a clear indication that these datasets are crucial for understanding the performance of their proposed method.

I will then look for detailed descriptions of each dataset, which are often found in subsections or tables. The paper provides a summary of the datasets, including the number of unique proteins and interactions for each:

1. **Human Dataset**: Contains 4,577 unique proteins and 75,875 interactions.
2. **SHS27K Dataset**: Contains 16,912 PPI entries involving 1,690 proteins and a total of 63,408 interactions.
3. **SHS148K Dataset**: Contains 99,782 PPI entries, 5,189 proteins, and 369,041 interactions.
4. **STRING Dataset**: A large collection with 4,775,154 PPI records relevant to human biology, covering 15,335 distinct proteins.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are essential for proper attribution and to allow readers to access the original sources of the datasets.

The citations I will extract are:

- For the **Human Dataset**:
  > Song, Y., et al. "Multifaceted protein–protein interaction prediction based on siamese residual rcnn." *Bioinformatics*, 35(14):i305–i314, 2019.

- For the **STRING Dataset**:
  > Szklarczyk, D., et al. "STRING v11: protein–protein association networks with increased coverage, supporting functional discovery in genome-wide experimental datasets." *Nucleic Acids Research*, 47(D1):D607–D613, 2019.

- For the **SHS27K and SHS148K Datasets**:
  > Chen, M., et al. "Multifaceted protein–protein interaction prediction based on siamese residual rcnn." *Bioinformatics*, 35(14):i305–i314, 2019.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference.

In summary, I have identified four datasets used in the paper, along with their descriptions and citations, ensuring that I have captured all necessary details for proper attribution and further exploration.
