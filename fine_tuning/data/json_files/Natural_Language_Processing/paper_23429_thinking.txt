To extract datasets from the research paper titled "AGALE: A Graph-Aware Continual Learning Evaluation Framework" by Tianqi Zhao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors demonstrate their evaluation framework on multiple datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments** section. In this paper, the authors explicitly mention three datasets used for evaluation:

1. **PCG Dataset**: This dataset consists of nodes representing proteins and edges corresponding to protein functional interactions, with labels indicating the phenotypes of the proteins.

2. **DBLP Dataset**: In this dataset, nodes represent authors, edges denote co-authorship relationships, and labels indicate the research areas of the authors.

3. **Yelp Dataset**: Here, nodes correspond to customer reviews, edges represent friendships, and node labels indicate the types of businesses.

I will then confirm the details of these datasets in the **experiments section**, where the authors provide additional context and statistics about each dataset.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and should be formatted correctly. Based on the information provided in the paper, I will compile the following citations:

- For the **PCG Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Tianqi Zhao, Thi Ngan Dong, Alan Hanjalic, and Megha Khosla. *Multi-label node classification on graph-structured data*. Transactions on Machine Learning Research, 2023. URL: https://openreview.net/forum?id=EZhkV2BjDP.

- For the **DBLP Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Uchenna Akujuobi, Yufei Han, Qiannan Zhang, and Xiangliang Zhang. *Collaborative graph walk for semi-supervised multi-label node classification*. CoRR, abs/1910.09706, 2019. URL: http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.09706.

- For the **Yelp Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Hanqing Zeng, Hongkuan Zhou, Ajitesh Srivastava, Rajgopal Kannan, and Viktor K. Prasanna. *Graphsaint: Graph sampling based inductive learning method*. CoRR, abs/1907.04931, 2019. URL: http://arxiv.org/abs/1907.04931.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described accurately and includes the full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details and that the citations are correctly attributed.
