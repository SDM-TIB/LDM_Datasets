To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Mapping AI Arguments in Journalism and Communication Studies" by Gregory Gondwe, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** to see if any datasets are mentioned or implied. The abstract discusses the typologies of AI in journalism but does not explicitly mention any datasets. The introduction similarly focuses on the role of AI in journalism without naming specific datasets.

Next, I will examine the **main body of the paper**, particularly sections that discuss practical applications of AI in journalism. I will look for any references to datasets used in the examples provided, especially in sections discussing machine learning, natural language processing, and other AI subfields.

In the sections discussing **machine learning applications**, I will pay close attention to any examples that might reference datasets, such as the mention of "news articles from various reliable sources" or "structured data like financial reports or sports statistics." However, these are general references and do not specify particular datasets.

I will also check for any **figures or tables** that might summarize datasets or provide examples of data used in the research. If there are any figures that reference datasets, I will note them down.

Next, I will look at the **conclusion and references** sections to see if the author cites any datasets or studies that include datasets. The references may provide insights into datasets used in related research, even if they are not explicitly mentioned in the main text.

After reviewing the entire paper, I will compile a list of any datasets identified, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset. If no specific datasets are mentioned, I will note that as well.

Finally, I will summarize my findings, ensuring that I have accurately captured the relevant datasets and their citations, if applicable. If no datasets are found, I will clearly state that the paper does not provide specific datasets for analysis.
