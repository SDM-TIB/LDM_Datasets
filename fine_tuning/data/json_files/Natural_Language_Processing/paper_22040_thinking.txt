To extract datasets from the research paper titled "RFL-CDNet: Towards Accurate Change Detection via Richer Feature Learning" by Yuhang Gan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark datasets, which indicates that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets and Evaluation Metrics)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention three datasets:

1. **WHU Cultivated Land Dataset**: This dataset consists of 3,194 bi-temporal images for training and 1,000 bi-temporal images for testing, with an image resolution of 1-2 meters. The authors note that the dataset was collected and labeled by the State Key Laboratory of Information Engineering in Surveying, Mapping and Remote Sensing of Wuhan University.

2. **CDD Dataset**: This dataset is widely used for change detection and contains 11 pairs of bi-temporal images obtained from Google Earth, with resolutions ranging from 0.03 to 1 meter. The authors explain that the original dataset consists of various image sizes, which were cropped to generate 10,000 bi-temporal images for training, 3,000 for validation, and 3,000 for testing.

3. **WHU Building Dataset**: This dataset focuses on building changes and contains a pair of very high-resolution remote sensing images. The authors describe the dataset as having a spatial resolution of 0.075 meters, with a training image of 21,243 x 15,354 pixels and a test image of 11,265 x 15,354 pixels.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **WHU Cultivated Land Dataset**, the citation is:
  > WHU cultivated land dataset. http://rsipac.whu.edu.cn/subject_two_2021.

- For the **CDD Dataset**, the citation is:
  > MA Lebedev, Yu V Vizilter, OV Vygolov, VA Knyaz, and A Yu Rubis. *Change Detection in Remote Sensing Images Using Conditional Adversarial Networks*. International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing & Spatial Information Sciences 42, 2 (2018).

- For the **WHU Building Dataset**, the citation is:

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and that the full citations are included. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
