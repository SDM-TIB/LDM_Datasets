To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Distribution-Aware Continual Test-Time Adaptation for Semantic Segmentation" by Jiayi Ni et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on two widely-used semantic segmentation CTTA benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section (Section IV)**, where the authors provide details about the datasets used. In **Section IV-A (Datasets and Implementation Details)**, they mention two specific datasets:

1. **ACDC Dataset**: This dataset is described as containing images collected in four different visual conditions: Fog, Night, Rain, and Snow. It is used for a semantic segmentation task designed for cross-domain learning in autonomous driving.

2. **SHIFT Dataset**: This dataset is characterized as a synthetic driving video dataset that simulates real-world autonomous driving scenarios. It consists of a discrete set containing 4,250 sequences and a continuous set with an additional 600 sequences.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **ACDC Dataset**, the citation is:
  > C. Sakaridis, D. Dai, and L. Van Gool. *Acdc: The adverse conditions dataset with correspondences for semantic driving scene understanding*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision, 2021, pp. 10 765–10 775.

- For the **SHIFT Dataset**, the citation is:
  > T. Sun, M. Segu, J. Postels, Y. Wang, L. Van Gool, B. Schiele, F. Tombari, and F. Yu. *Shift: A synthetic driving dataset for continuous multi-task domain adaptation*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2022, pp. 21 371–21 382.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
