To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-Modal Multi-Task (3MT) Road Segmentation" by Erkan Milli et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that experiments were conducted on the **KITTI dataset** and **Cityscapes dataset**, which suggests that these are the primary datasets used in the research.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** to confirm the datasets used and gather more details about them. In the experiments section, the authors explicitly mention that they used the **KITTI dataset** for road segmentation tasks and provide details about its structure, including the number of training and test images. They also mention the **Cityscapes dataset**, highlighting its labels and the number of images in the training and validation sets.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

1. For the **KITTI dataset**, the citation is:
   > A. Geiger, P. Lenz, C. Stiller, and R. Urtasun. "Vision meets robotics: The KITTI dataset." In *International Journal of Robotics Research (IJRR)*, 2013.

2. For the **Cityscapes dataset**, the citation is:
   > M. Cordts, M. Omran, S. Ramos, T. Scharw√§chter, M. Enzweiler, R. Benenson, U. Franke, S. Roth, and B. Schiele. "The Cityscapes Dataset." In *CVPR Workshop on The Future of Datasets in Vision*, 2015.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will help maintain clarity and ensure that all necessary details are captured for future reference or processing.
