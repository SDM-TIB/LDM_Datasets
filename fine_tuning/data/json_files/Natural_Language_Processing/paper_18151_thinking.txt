To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MLLM-Tool: A Multimodal Large Language Model For Tool Agent Learning" by Chenyu Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors collected a dataset from HuggingFace, which suggests that there is a specific dataset of interest.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Dataset Construction)**, where the authors describe the process of constructing their benchmark dataset. They mention a dataset called **ToolMMBench**, which is specifically designed for evaluating the capabilities of their model. This section provides details about the dataset's characteristics, including the number of APIs collected and the types of multimodal inputs included.

In section 3.4, the authors provide statistics about the dataset, confirming that **ToolMMBench** consists of 932 high-quality machine learning-related APIs, with a breakdown of the types of inputs (text, image, audio, video). This section is crucial for understanding the dataset's scope and application.

I will also check the **References section** to find any citations related to the datasets mentioned. However, since ToolMMBench is a newly constructed dataset by the authors, it may not have an external citation yet. Instead, I will note that the dataset is derived from HuggingFace, which is a well-known platform for machine learning models.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring to include the full citation for the dataset as follows:

- For **ToolMMBench**, the citation is:

Finally, I will summarize the findings and prepare the dataset entries for further processing or review.
