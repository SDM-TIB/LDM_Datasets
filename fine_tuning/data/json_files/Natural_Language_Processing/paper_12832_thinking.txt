To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An Empirical Analysis of Range for 3D Object Detection" by Neehar Peri et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted an empirical analysis using the **Argoverse 2.0 dataset**, which is a strong indication that this dataset is central to their research.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. In **section 4.1 (Dataset and Metrics)**, the authors explicitly state that they conducted their experiments on **Argoverse 2.0**, describing it as an autonomous driving dataset with data collected in six US cities, labeling 26 semantic classes for the 3D detection task. They also mention that it produces long-range LiDAR point clouds and object annotations (up to Â±150m). This confirms that **Argoverse 2.0** is the primary dataset used in their analysis.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the **Argoverse 2.0 dataset**. The citation provided in the references is:
> Benjamin Wilson, William Qi, Tanmay Agarwal, John Lambert, Jagjeet Singh, Siddhesh Khandelwal, Bowen Pan, Ratnesh Kumar, Jhony Kaesemodel Pontes, Deva Ramanan, Peter Carr, and James Hays. *Argoverse 2: Next generation datasets for self-driving perception and forecasting*. In Thirty-fifth Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems Datasets and Benchmarks Track (Round 2), 2021.

Since **Argoverse 2.0** is the only dataset mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation as required.

After gathering all the necessary details, I will prepare the dataset entry for **Argoverse 2.0** and ensure it is ready for further processing or review.
