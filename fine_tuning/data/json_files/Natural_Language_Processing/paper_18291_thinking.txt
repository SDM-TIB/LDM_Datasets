To extract datasets from the research paper titled "TURNA: A Turkish Encoder-Decoder Language Model for Enhanced Understanding and Generation" by Gökçe Uludoğan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that TURNA is evaluated on various tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved. The introduction discusses the need for large-scale pretrained models for Turkish, hinting at the use of multiple datasets for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **Data section** (section 3), which is likely to contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used for pretraining and evaluation. Here, the authors mention compiling a diverse Turkish monolingual dataset and provide a summary table (Table 1) that lists various datasets along with their types and statistics.

In section 3.1, the authors describe the **Web Corpora**, which includes data from OSCAR and mC4. In section 3.2, they detail the **Dergipark** scientific corpus, and in section 3.3, they discuss the **Book Corpus**. Section 3.4 introduces the **Bilkent Creative Writings corpus**, and section 3.5 describes the **ParlaMintTR corpus**. Each of these sections provides specific details about the datasets, including the number of documents and tokens.

I will also check the **Fine-tuning Datasets section** (A.2) for additional datasets used in downstream tasks. Here, the authors provide a list of datasets for various tasks, including paraphrasing, summarization, named entity recognition, and text classification.

Now, I will compile the datasets identified in the paper along with their full citations from the **References section**. The datasets I will extract include:
