To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Information Flow Routes: Automatically Interpreting Language Models at Scale" by Javier Ferrando and Elena Voita, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the work, including any datasets used. In this case, the abstract does not mention specific datasets, so I will move on to the introduction.

Next, I will look for any references to datasets in the **experiments** section, as this is where authors typically describe the data they used for their evaluations. In the provided text, I see that the authors mention experimenting with **Llama 2** and refer to datasets like **C4** and **CodeParrot**. 

I will then check the **results** and **discussion** sections to see if there are any additional datasets mentioned or if the authors provide more details about the datasets used. The paper mentions using a subset of 1000 sentences from the **C4 dataset** and also references **CodeParrot** for code data. 

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. **C4 Dataset**: The citation for the C4 dataset is:
   > Raffel, C., Shazeer, N., Roberts, A., Lee, K., Narang, S., Matena, M., Zhou, Y., Li, W., and Liu, P. J. *Exploring the limits of transfer learning with a unified text-to-text transformer*. J. Mach. Learn. Res., 21(1), jan 2020. ISSN 1532-4435.

2. **CodeParrot Dataset**: The citation for the CodeParrot dataset is:
   > CodeParrot. *GitHub Code Dataset*. Available at: https://huggingface.co/datasets/codeparrot/github-code.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets in a clear format, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as they are crucial for proper attribution.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that can be easily reviewed or processed further.
