To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Benchmarking of Cancelable Biometrics for Deep Templates" by Hatef Otroshi Shahreza et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the paper benchmarks various cancelable biometrics on different biometric characteristics, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **Section II (Benchmarking Framework)**, particularly **Section II-A (Biometric Characteristics)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for different biometric characteristics. Here, I will look for explicit mentions of datasets and their descriptions.

1. **MOBIO Dataset**: This dataset is used for both face and voice recognition. It is described as a bimodal dataset that includes face and voice data from 150 individuals across 12 sessions, with multiple samples captured per individual. The citation for this dataset is:
   > C. McCool, R. Wallace, M. McLaren, L. El Shafey, and S. Marcel. *Session variability modelling for face authentication*. IET Biometrics, vol. 2, no. 3, pp. 117–129, Sep. 2013.

2. **SDUMLA Dataset**: This dataset is utilized for finger vein recognition and consists of finger vein images from 106 individuals, with multiple samples captured for each instance. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Y. Yin, L. Liu, and X. Sun. *SDUMLA-HMT: A multimodal biometric database*. In Chinese Conference on Biometric Recognition. Springer, 2011, pp. 260–268.

3. **CASIA Thousand Dataset**: This dataset is used for iris recognition and includes images from 1000 individuals, with 10 images per individual. The citation for this dataset is:
   > "Chinese Academy of Sciences Institute of Automation. CASIA Iris Image Database," 2004. [Online]. Available: http://biometrics.idealtest.org.

After identifying these datasets, I will verify their usage in the **experiments section** to confirm that they were indeed employed in the study. The authors mention using the MOBIO dataset for both face and voice recognition, the SDUMLA dataset for finger vein recognition, and the CASIA Thousand dataset for iris recognition, which aligns with my findings.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, along with their respective citations.
