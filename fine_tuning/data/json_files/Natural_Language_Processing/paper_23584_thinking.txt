To extract datasets from the research paper titled "RoboMamba: Multimodal State Space Model for Efficient Robot Reasoning and Manipulation" by Jiaming Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention key datasets used for evaluation. In the introduction, the authors often discuss the context of their work, which may include references to datasets that are foundational to their research.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, as this section typically contains detailed information about the datasets used in the experiments. In this paper, the authors describe two stages of training: alignment pre-training and robot manipulation fine-tuning. I will look for specific datasets mentioned in these stages.

In **subsection 4.1 (Experiment settings)**, the authors list the datasets used for both stages:

1. **LLaVA-LCS 558K**: This dataset is a curated subset of the LAION-CC-SBU dataset, specifically filtered for balanced concept coverage and includes captions paired with synthetic captions.
   
2. **LLaVA-v1.5 655K**: A mixture of ten distinct datasets, including VQAv2, GQA, and others, used for instruction tuning.

3. **LRV-INSTRUCT 400K**: A dataset containing visual instructions generated by GPT-4, aimed at mitigating hallucination in robotic tasks.

4. **RoboVQA 800K**: A dataset designed to enhance robot-related reasoning abilities, comprising episodes of robotic tasks paired with image and text prompts.

5. **SAPIEN**: Used for robot manipulation fine-tuning, this dataset includes simulated interactions with articulated objects.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets.

The citations I will extract are:

  > Haotian Liu, Chunyuan Li, Yuheng Li, and Yong Jae Lee. *Visual instruction tuning*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2304.08485, 2023.

- For **SAPIEN**:
  > Fanbo Xiang, Yuzhe Qin, Kaichun Mo, et al. *SAPIEN: A simulated part-based interactive environment*. In The IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), June 2020.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details and that the citations are accurate and complete.
