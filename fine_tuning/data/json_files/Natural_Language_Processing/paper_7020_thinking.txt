To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A new Hyper-heuristic based on Adaptive Simulated Annealing and Reinforcement Learning for the Capacitated Electric Vehicle Routing Problem" by Erick RodrÃ­guez-Esparza et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental framework sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the development of a hyper-heuristic approach for the Capacitated Electric Vehicle Routing Problem (CEVRP), which suggests that datasets related to this problem may be included.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to see if the authors reference any specific datasets or benchmarks used in their research. The introduction mentions the increasing importance of last-mile logistics and the need for efficient routing solutions, but I need to find specific datasets.

In the **experimental framework section**, the authors explicitly mention using instances from the IEEE WCCI 2020 competition benchmark for CEVRP. They state that this benchmark contains 17 instances of varying sizes, which is crucial information for dataset extraction.

I will then compile the details of the benchmark datasets mentioned:

1. **IEEE WCCI 2020 CEVRP Benchmark**: This benchmark includes 17 instances, with a mix of small and large problems, ranging from 21 to 1000 customers. The authors provide a table summarizing the details of each instance, including the number of customers, charging stations, and other relevant parameters.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the benchmark dataset. The authors reference the benchmark as follows:

- For the **IEEE WCCI 2020 CEVRP Benchmark**, the citation is:
  > Mavrovouniotis, M., Menelaou, C., Timotheou, S., Panayiotou, C., Ellinas, G., Polycarpou, M. (2020b). *Benchmark set for the IEEE WCCI-2020 competition on evolutionary computation for the electric vehicle routing problem*. KIOS CoE, University of Cyprus, Cyprus, Tech. Rep.

After gathering this information, I will prepare the dataset entries according to the required format, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured output for further use or analysis.
