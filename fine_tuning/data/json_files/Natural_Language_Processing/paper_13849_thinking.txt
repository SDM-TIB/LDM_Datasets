To extract datasets from the research paper titled "LCReg: Long-Tailed Image Classification with Latent Categories based Recognition" by Weide Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments on five long-tailed image recognition datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.2 (Dataset)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention:

1. **CIFAR-10-LT**: A long-tailed version of the CIFAR-10 dataset, which consists of 50,000 training images across 10 categories. The authors describe how they created the long-tailed version by rearranging the training samples to create an imbalance factor.

2. **CIFAR-100-LT**: Similar to CIFAR-10-LT, this dataset is a long-tailed version of CIFAR-100, which contains 10,000 training images across 100 categories. The authors also explain the process of creating the long-tailed version.

3. **ImageNet-LT**: This dataset contains 115,846 training images and 50,000 validation images across 1,000 categories. The authors reference the original ImageNet dataset and describe how they created the long-tailed version using a Pareto distribution.

4. **iNaturalist 2018**: A large-scale dataset with 435,713 images for 8,142 categories, characterized by an extremely unbalanced distribution.

5. **Places-LT**: A long-tailed version of the Places dataset, which consists of 184.5K images for 365 categories.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **CIFAR-10** and **CIFAR-100**, the original dataset citations are:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. *CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets*. 2009.

- For **ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Olga Russakovsky, Jia Deng, et al. *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 115(3):211-252, 2015.

- For **iNaturalist 2018**, the citation is:
  > Greg Van Horn, et al. *The iNaturalist Species Classification and Detection Dataset*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2018.

- For **Places**, the citation is:
  > B. Zhou, A. Lapedriza, A. Khosla, A. Oliva, and A. Torralba. *Places: A 10 Million Image Database for Scene Recognition*. IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 40(6):1452-1464, 2017.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes the full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details or citations.
