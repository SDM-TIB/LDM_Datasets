To extract datasets from the research paper titled "How Can We Tame the Long-Tail of Chest X-ray Datasets?" by Arsh Verma, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the challenges of chest X-ray datasets and hints at the use of multiple datasets for training and evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental setup section** where the author lists the datasets used for the experiments. Here, the author mentions four datasets:

1. **NIH CXR**: This dataset is referenced multiple times, indicating its significance in the study. It is used for pretraining and contains a variety of labels.

2. **PadChest**: This dataset is also used for pretraining and is noted for its multi-label annotated reports.

3. **CheXpert**: Another dataset used for pretraining, which is known for its large size and uncertainty labels.

4. **MIMIC CXR**: This dataset is specifically mentioned as the one used for evaluation in the experiments, and it contains an expanded set of labels.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for each of these datasets:

- For **NIH CXR**, the citation is:
  > RM Summers. NIH Chest X-Ray Dataset of 14 Common Thorax Disease Categories, 2019.

- For **PadChest**, the citation is:
  > Aurelia Bustos, Antonio Pertusa, Jose-Maria Salinas, and Maria de la Iglesia-VayÃ¡. Padchest: A Large Chest X-Ray Image dataset with Multi-label annotated reports. Medical image analysis, 66, 2020.

- For **CheXpert**, the citation is:
  > Jeremy Irvin, Pranav Rajpurkar, Michael Ko, Yifan Yu, Silviana Ciurea-Ilcus, Chris Chute, Henrik Marklund, Behzad Haghgoo, Robyn Ball, Katie Shpanskaya, et al. Chexpert: A Large Chest Radiograph Dataset with Uncertainty Labels and Expert Comparison. In Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI), 2019.

- For **MIMIC CXR**, the citation is:
  > Alistair EW Johnson, Tom J Pollard, Seth J Berkowitz, Nathaniel R Greenbaum, Matthew P Lungren, Chih-ying Deng, Roger G Mark, and Steven Horng. MIMIC-CXR, A De-identified publicly available database of Chest Radiographs with free-text reports. Scientific Data, 6(1), 2019.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant datasets from the paper while adhering to the importance of proper citation.
