To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Audio Dialogues: Dialogues dataset for audio and music understanding" by Arushi Goel et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract introduces the **Audio Dialogues** dataset, which contains 163.8k samples for general audio sounds and music. This indicates that the dataset is central to the paper's contributions.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **methodology** or **data generation pipeline** sections. In the paper, the authors mention that the **Audio Dialogues** dataset is generated using annotations from two existing datasets: **AudioSet-SL** and **MusicCaps**. This is crucial as it indicates the sources from which the new dataset is derived.

In the **data generation pipeline** section, the authors describe how they utilize the **AudioSet-SL** dataset, which has time-stamped annotations for audio clips, and the **MusicCaps** dataset, which contains detailed descriptions for music samples. This confirms that both datasets are integral to the creation of the **Audio Dialogues** dataset.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. **AudioSet-SL**:
   > Hershey, S., Ellis, D. P., Fonseca, E., Jansen, A., Liu, C., Moore, R. C., & Plakal, M. (2021). The benefit of temporally-strong labels in audio event classification. In *ICASSP 2021-2021 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)* (pp. 366â€“370). IEEE.

2. **MusicCaps**:
   > Agostinelli, A., Denk, T. I., Borsos, Z., Engel, J., Verzetti, M., Caillon, A., Huang, Q., Jansen, A., Roberts, A., Tagliasacchi, M., et al. (2023). MusicLM: Generating music from text. *arXiv preprint arXiv:2301.11325*.

With these citations in hand, I can now summarize the datasets:

- **Audio Dialogues**: A new dataset created for multi-turn dialogues about audio and music, containing 163.8k samples.
- **AudioSet-SL**: A dataset providing time-stamped annotations for audio clips, used as a source for generating dialogues.
- **MusicCaps**: A dataset with detailed descriptions for music samples, also used in the dialogue generation process.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that each dataset is clearly identified with its full citation.
