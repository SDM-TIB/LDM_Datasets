To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Characterizing Speed Performance of Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning" by Samuel Wiggins et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract discusses the performance of Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) algorithms but does not mention specific datasets. The introduction elaborates on the challenges and applications of MARL but still lacks explicit dataset references.

Next, I will examine the **methodology and experiments sections** (if available) for any mentions of datasets used in the analysis. In this paper, the authors focus on three state-of-the-art MARL algorithms: **Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (MADDPG)**, **Target-oriented Multi-agent Communication and Cooperation (ToM2C)**, and **Networked Multi-agent RL (NeurComm)**. However, they do not specify any datasets used for training or evaluation in the sections I have reviewed.

I will also check the **results and discussion sections** for any references to datasets. The paper primarily discusses the performance metrics and comparisons of the algorithms rather than specific datasets. 

Finally, I will look at the **references section** to see if any datasets are cited indirectly through the works referenced. The references include various papers on MARL and reinforcement learning, but they do not explicitly mention datasets used in this study.

Since the paper does not provide any specific datasets or their citations, I will conclude that there are no datasets to extract from this paper. 

In summary, I will document that no datasets were identified in the paper "Characterizing Speed Performance of Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning" by Samuel Wiggins et al., and therefore, there are no citations to provide.
