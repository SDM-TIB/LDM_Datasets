To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Silo NLP’s Participation at WAT2022" by Shantipriya Parida et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their full citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** sections to get an overview of the tasks and datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates participation in multimodal translation tasks, which suggests that datasets related to these tasks will be discussed.

Next, I will focus on the **Datasets section** (section 2) where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they describe three datasets:

1. **HindiVisualGenome 1.1 (HVG)**: This dataset is used for the English→Hindi multimodal translation task. It consists of 29,000 English and Hindi short captions paired with images. The authors mention that it includes three test sets: development (D-Test), evaluation (E-Test), and challenge test set (C-Test).

2. **MalayalamVisualGenome 1.0 (MVG)**: This dataset is an extension of HVG for the Malayalam language. It contains bilingual English–Malayalam segments and has the same size and images as HVG.

3. **BengaliVisualGenome 1.0 (BVG)**: Similar to MVG, this dataset is an extension of HVG for the Bengali language, maintaining the same size and images.

Additionally, the authors mention using the **Flickr8k dataset** for generating synthetic image features, which is relevant for their multimodal translation tasks.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
