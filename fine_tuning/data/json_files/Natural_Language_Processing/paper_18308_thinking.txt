To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Uncertainty-Guided Alignment for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation in Regression" by Ismail Nejjar et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's focus on unsupervised domain adaptation for regression, but I need to look for specific datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will examine **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they mention four benchmarks for unsupervised domain adaptation regression:

1. **dSprites**: A synthetic 2D image dataset with five independent latent factors, treated as three separate domains: Color (C), Scream (S), and Noise (N). Each domain consists of 737,280 images.

2. **MPI3D**: Contains 1,036,800 examples of 3D objects from three domains: Toy (T), Realistic (RC), and Real (RL). This dataset is used to study domain gaps between real and simulated data in a robotics context.

3. **Biwi Kinect**: A dataset consisting of over 15,000 real-world images of 20 individuals, capturing head rotations with variations in yaw, pitch, and roll angles.

4. **SmallNORB**: A dataset comprising images depicting 50 toys, captured under varying lighting conditions, with the objective of predicting the rotation of objects.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For the datasets mentioned, I will compile the following citations:

- **dSprites**:

- **MPI3D**:

- **SmallNORB**: 
  > SmallNORB dataset. *SmallNORB: A dataset for 3D object recognition*. http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~breuel/smallnorb/.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will prepare to format this information according to the required structure for downstream processing or review.
