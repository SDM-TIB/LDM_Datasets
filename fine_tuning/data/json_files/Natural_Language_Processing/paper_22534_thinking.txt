To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Methodology-Oriented Study of Catastrophic Forgetting in Incremental Deep Neural Networks" by Ashutosh Kumar, Sonali Agarwal, and D Jude Hemanth, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the challenges of catastrophic forgetting in incremental learning but does not specify any datasets. The introduction may provide context or examples, so I will pay close attention to any references to datasets.

Next, I will examine **section 3 (Learning Scenarios)**, where the authors mention using the **MNIST-digits dataset** for their experiments. They describe two specific protocols: **split MNIST** and **permuted MNIST**. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for their evaluation of incremental learning methods.

In **section 4 (Incremental Learning Approaches)**, the authors elaborate on various methods and their performance on the MNIST datasets, confirming their relevance in the context of the study. 

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

1. **MNIST Dataset**:
   > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998. Available: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

2. **Split MNIST**:
   > Chaudhry, A., Dokania, P. K., Ajanthan, T., & Torr, P. H. (2018). *Riemannian walk for incremental learning: Understanding forgetting and intransigence*. In Proceedings of the European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), pages 532â€“547.

3. **Permuted MNIST**:
   > Goodfellow, I., Mirza, M., Xiao, D., Courville, A., & Bengio, Y. (2013). *An empirical investigation of catastrophic forgetting in gradient-based neural networks*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1312.6211.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations.
