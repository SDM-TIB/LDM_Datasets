To extract datasets from the research paper titled "JEFL: Joint Embedding of Formal Proof Libraries" by Qingxiang Wang and Cezary Kaliszyk, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract discusses the need for a tool to explore commonalities among formal libraries, which suggests that datasets related to proof assistants might be involved.

Next, I will examine the **methodology** and **experiments** sections, as these typically contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the research. In this paper, the authors mention using data from **HOL4** and **HOL Light** proof libraries, which are crucial for their experiments.

In the **experiments section**, the authors specify that they have a total of **18,723 lines of tt items in HOL4** and **16,874 lines of tt items in HOL Light**. This indicates that these libraries serve as the datasets for their research.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. Since HOL4 and HOL Light are established proof assistants, I will refer to their respective foundational papers for proper citations:

1. For **HOL4**, the citation is:
   > Harrison, J. (2009). *HOL Light: An Overview*. In S. Berghofer, T. Nipkow, C. Urban, & M. Wenzel (Eds.), Theorem Proving in Higher Order Logics (TPHOLs 2009), LNCS, vol. 5674, pp. 60â€“66. Springer. https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-03359-9_4

2. For **HOL Light**, the citation is:
   > Gordon, M. J., & Melham, T. F. (1993). *Introduction to HOL: A theorem proving environment for higher order logic*. Cambridge University Press.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

- **HOL4**: A formal proof library containing 18,723 lines of tt items used for embedding and similarity discovery.
- **HOL Light**: Another formal proof library with 16,874 lines of tt items utilized in the experiments.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly presents each dataset along with its full citation, ensuring that all details are accurate and complete for future reference or analysis.
