To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Language Models with Pre-Trained (GloVe) Word Embeddings" by Victor Makarenkov et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The introduction discusses the use of GloVe embeddings, which suggests that there may be datasets related to the training of these embeddings.

Next, I will focus on the **detailed explanation and evaluation sections**. In these sections, the authors mention using pre-trained GloVe vectors and specifically trained vector models based on the proceedings of the SIGIR-2015 and ICTIR-2015 conferences. This indicates that there are datasets involved in the training of the GloVe embeddings and the specific models used.

I will identify the datasets as follows:

1. **GloVe Pre-Trained Vectors**: The authors mention using pre-trained GloVe vectors trained on a large corpus (Common Crawl). This dataset is crucial for their language model.

2. **SIGIR-2015 Proceedings**: The authors specifically trained a vector model on the proceedings of the SIGIR-2015 conference, which is another dataset they utilized.

3. **ICTIR-2015 Proceedings**: Similarly, they also mention using the ICTIR-2015 conference proceedings for training a domain-specific vector model.

Now, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **GloVe embeddings**, the citation is:
  > Pennington, J., Socher, R., Manning, C.D. (2014). *GloVe: Global Vectors for Word Representation*. In Proceedings of the Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), pages 1532–1543.

- For the **SIGIR-2015 Proceedings**, the citation is:
  > Makarenkov, V., Shapira, B., Rokach, L. (2015). *Theoretical Categorization of Query Performance Predictors*. In Proceedings of the 2015 International Conference on The Theory of Information Retrieval (ICTIR), pages 369–372.

- For the **ICTIR-2015 Proceedings**, the citation is the same as above since the authors used the same paper for their domain-specific model.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and that the full citations are included for reference. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
