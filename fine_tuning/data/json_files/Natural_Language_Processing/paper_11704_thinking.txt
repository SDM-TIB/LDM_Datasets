To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MOVES: Movable and Moving LiDAR Scene Segmentation in Label-Free settings using Static Reconstruction" by Prashant Kumar et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the problem and the proposed solution, and it may mention datasets used for evaluation. 

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of segmenting non-stationary objects in LiDAR scans and introduce their method, MOVES. They mention the use of "corresponding static-dynamic LiDAR pairs," which indicates that datasets are involved, but I need to find specific names.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention three datasets:

1. **ARD-16**: A real-world industrial LiDAR dataset collected using a 16-beam VLP-Puck LiDAR sensor. It has paired correspondence information available and is noted for being challenging due to its sparsity.

2. **KITTI**: A well-known dataset used to demonstrate the model's performance in the absence of correspondence information. The authors note that less than 7% of the available scans are static scans without any correspondence information.

3. **CARLA-64**: An extensive dataset collected using the CARLA simulator with paired correspondence between static and dynamic scans. The authors highlight the ease of collecting such paired datasets in urban and industrial settings.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **ARD-16**, the citation is:
  > Kumar, P., Sahoo, S., Shah, V., Kondameedi, V., Jain, A., Verma, A., Bhattacharyya, C., Vishwanath, V. "Dynamic to static LiDAR scan reconstruction using adversarially trained autoencoder." In Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, volume 35, 2021, pp. 1836–1844.

- For **KITTI**, the citation is:
  > Geiger, A., Lenz, P., Urtasun, R. "Are we ready for autonomous driving? The KITTI vision benchmark suite." In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2012, pp. 3354–3361.

- For **CARLA-64**, the citation is:
  > Dosovitskiy, A., Ros, G., Codevilla, F., Lopez, A., Koltun, V. "CARLA: An open urban driving simulator." In Proceedings of the 1st Annual Conference on Robot Learning, 2017, pp. 1–16.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations as presented in the paper.
