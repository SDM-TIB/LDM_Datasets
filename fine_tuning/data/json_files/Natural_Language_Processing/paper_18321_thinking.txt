To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Optimization-Based Motion Primitive Automata for Autonomous Driving" by Matheus V. A. Pedrosa et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and evaluation sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses trajectory planning and mentions evaluations in simulations and laboratory experiments, which suggests that datasets may be involved.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any references to datasets. The authors discuss motion planning and optimization criteria but do not explicitly mention datasets here. I will then look into the **evaluation and results section**, where they describe the Cyber-Physical Mobility Lab (CPM Lab) and the simulations conducted. This section may provide insights into the datasets used for testing.

In the **evaluation section**, the authors mention that they tested their approach in the CPM Lab, which is an open-source platform for networked and autonomous vehicles. However, they do not specify any datasets directly. I will also check the **references section** for any datasets that might be cited indirectly through the works referenced.

Upon reviewing the references, I find that the following papers may contain relevant datasets or benchmarks:

1. **Commonroad**: The authors reference a paper that discusses "Commonroad: Composable benchmarks for motion planning on roads." This suggests that the Commonroad dataset is relevant for their work on motion planning.

   Citation:
   > M. Althoff, M. Koschi, and S. Manzinger. *Commonroad: Composable benchmarks for motion planning on roads*. In Proc. of the IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium, 2017.

2. **Cyber-Physical Mobility Lab**: The authors also reference their own work on the CPM Lab, which is an open-source platform for testing autonomous vehicles. While this does not refer to a traditional dataset, it indicates that the experiments were conducted using this platform.

   Citation:
   > M. Kloock, P. Scheffe, J. Maczijewski, A. Kampmann, A. Mokhtarian, S. Kowalewski, and B. Alrifaee. *Cyber-Physical Mobility Lab: An open-source platform for networked and autonomous vehicles*. In 2021 European Control Conference (ECC), pp. 1937â€“1944, 2021.

After identifying these references, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset mentioned or implied in the paper. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets relevant to the research conducted in this paper.
