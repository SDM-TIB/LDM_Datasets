To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Reliable Conflictive Multi-View Learning" by Cai Xu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **experiments section**, the authors explicitly mention that they evaluated their method on **six publicly available datasets**. This is a strong indication that I will find detailed descriptions of these datasets in this section.

Next, I will locate the **specific datasets mentioned** in the experiments section. The paper lists the following datasets:

1. **HandWritten**: This dataset comprises 2000 instances of handwritten numerals ranging from '0' to '9', with 200 patterns per class, represented using six feature sets.

2. **CUB**: The CUB dataset consists of 11,788 instances associated with text descriptions of 200 different categories of birds. The authors focus on the first 10 categories and extract image features using GoogleNet and corresponding text features using doc2vec.

3. **HMDB**: This is a large-scale human action recognition dataset containing 6,718 instances from 51 action categories. The authors extract HOG and MBH features as multiple views for this dataset.

4. **Scene15**: This dataset includes 4,485 images from 15 indoor and outdoor scene categories. The authors extract three types of features: GIST, PHOG, and LBP.

5. **Caltech101**: Comprising 8,677 images from 101 classes, the authors select the first 10 categories and extract two deep features (views) using DECAF and VGG19 models.

6. **PIE**: This dataset contains 680 instances belonging to 68 classes, with features extracted as intensity, LBP, and Gabor as three views.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, along with their full citations for reference.
