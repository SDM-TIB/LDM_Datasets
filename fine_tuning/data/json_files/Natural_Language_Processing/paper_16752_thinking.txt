To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MERLIM: Multi-modal Evaluation Benchmark for Large Image-Language Models" by Andrés Villa et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the introduction of a benchmark called **MERLIM**, which contains over 279K image-question pairs. This indicates that there is a dataset involved, but I need to identify the specific datasets used within this benchmark.

Next, I will examine the **Datasets and Tasks** section, which is likely to provide detailed information about the datasets utilized in the study. In this section, the authors mention that MERLIM leverages images from well-established datasets such as **MS-COCO**, **LVIS**, and **Visual Genome**. 

1. **MS-COCO**: This dataset is referenced as the primary source for object recognition and instance counting tasks. It is a widely used dataset in computer vision that contains images with annotations for object detection, segmentation, and captioning.

2. **LVIS**: The authors mention that they extend the MS-COCO ground-truth classes by incorporating class labels from the LVIS dataset. LVIS is known for its large vocabulary instance segmentation.

3. **Visual Genome**: This dataset is used for the reasoning task, providing detailed annotations for object relationships and attributes.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **MS-COCO**, the citation is:
  > Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, Serge Belongie, James Hays, Pietro Perona, Deva Ramanan, Piotr Dollar, and C Lawrence Zitnick. *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. In European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), pages 740–755, 2014.

- For **LVIS**, the citation is:
  > Agrim Gupta, Piotr Dollar, and Ross Girshick. *LVIS: A Dataset for Large Vocabulary Instance Segmentation*. In IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 5356–5364, 2019.

- For **Visual Genome**, the citation is:
  > Ranjay Krishna, Yuke Zhu, Oliver Groth, Justin Johnson, Kenji Hata, Joshua Kravitz, Stephanie Chen, Yannis Kalanatidis, Li-Jia Li, David A Shamma, et al. *Visual Genome: Connecting Language and Vision Using Crowdsourced Dense Image Annotations*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 123:32–73, 2017.

Now that I have gathered the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
