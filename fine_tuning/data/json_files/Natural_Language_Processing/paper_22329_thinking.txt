To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Representation Learning of Daily Movement Data Using Text Encoders" by Alexander Capstick et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study focuses on a dataset of recordings of in-home activity from people living with Dementia, which suggests that a specific dataset is central to the research.

Next, I will examine **section 2.2 (The Dataset)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset used in their study. Here, they describe the dataset collected from 134 people living with Dementia, which includes in-home data recorded between July 1, 2021, and January 30, 2024. The dataset consists of passive infrared (PIR) sensor recordings and sleep mat data, totaling 65,962 recorded days.

In this section, the authors provide specific statistics about the dataset, such as the average number of days recorded per participant and the total number of data points collected. This information is crucial for understanding the dataset's scope and significance.

Since the dataset is described in detail, I will now look for any references or citations related to this dataset in the **References section**. However, the authors mention that the dataset will not be made publicly available due to its sensitive nature, which means I may not find a formal citation for it. Instead, I will note that the dataset is proprietary and not publicly accessible.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring to include the dataset's name, description, and any relevant details, while also noting the lack of a formal citation due to the dataset's sensitive nature.

Finally, I will summarize the findings and prepare the dataset entry for review or further processing, ensuring that all relevant information is captured accurately.
