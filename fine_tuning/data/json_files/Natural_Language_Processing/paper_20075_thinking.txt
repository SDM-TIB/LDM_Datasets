To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Bayesian Preference Elicitation with Language Models" by Kunal Handa et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly referenced. The abstract discusses the use of language models for preference elicitation but does not mention specific datasets. The introduction elaborates on the need for understanding user preferences but again does not specify any datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental setup section** (Section 4) where the authors describe their methodology and the data used for their experiments. Here, they mention that they collected 30 articles from the New York Times for their content recommendation task. This is a clear indication of a dataset being utilized.

I will also check the **appendices** for any additional details about the datasets used. The paper mentions that the articles were hand-collected, which suggests that the dataset is not publicly available but is still important for the study.

Now, I will compile the information about the dataset:

1. **New York Times Articles Dataset**: This dataset consists of 30 articles collected from the New York Times, which includes various topics ranging from "What to Cook This Week" to "Barbie vs. Oppenheimer." The dataset is used for evaluating the performance of the proposed method in the context of content recommendation.

Next, I will look for the full citation of the dataset. Since the dataset is derived from the New York Times, I will cite it as follows:

- For the **New York Times Articles Dataset**, the citation is:
  > The New York Times. *The New York Times*. Available at: https://www.nytimes.com/.

Finally, I will summarize the dataset entry, ensuring that I include the full citation as required. 

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entry for review or further processing.
