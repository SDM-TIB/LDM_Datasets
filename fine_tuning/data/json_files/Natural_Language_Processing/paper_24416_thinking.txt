To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MR-MLLM: Mutual Reinforcement of Multimodal Comprehension and Vision Perception" by Guanqun Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information accurately, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for evaluation. The introduction often outlines the context and significance of the research, which may include references to specific datasets.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Experimental Setups)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used for training and evaluation. In this section, I will look for any named datasets and their descriptions. The authors mention training MR-MLLM on **150K single-turn instruction data from LLaVA** and **860K object detection data in an instruction tuning format**. They also mention fine-tuning on datasets for specific downstream tasks like **VSR**, **VQA 2.0**, and **COCO Caption**.

I will then check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. 

1. For **LLaVA**, the citation is:
   > Haotian Liu, Chunyuan Li, Qingyang Wu, and Yong Jae Lee. *Visual instruction tuning*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2304.08485, 2023.

2. For **VSR (Visual Spatial Reasoning)**, the citation is:
   > Fangyu Liu, Guy Edward Toh Emerson, and Nigel Collier. *Visual spatial reasoning*. Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics, 2023.

3. For **VQA 2.0 (Visual Question Answering)**, the citation is:
   > Aishwarya Agrawal, Jiasen Lu, Stanislaw Antol, Margaret Mitchell, C. Lawrence Zitnick, Devi Parikh, and Dhruv Batra. *VQA: Visual Question Answering*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 123:4 – 31, 2015.

4. For **COCO Caption**, the citation is:
   > Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, Serge Belongie, James Hays, Pietro Perona, Deva Ramanan, Piotr Dollár, and C Lawrence Zitnick. *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. In Computer Vision–ECCV 2014: 13th European Conference, Zurich, Switzerland, September 6-12, 2014, Proceedings, Part V 13, pages 740–755. Springer, 2014.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This structured approach will help in accurately extracting and documenting the datasets used in the research paper.
