To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DPPE: Dense Pose Estimation in a Plenoxels Environment using Gradient Approximation" by Christopher Kolios et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the work but may not specify datasets. The introduction often outlines the context and may mention datasets used in prior work.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly where the authors describe their experiments. This section typically contains explicit mentions of datasets used for training and evaluation. In this paper, the authors mention using the **NeRF synthetic dataset** for their experiments, which is a key dataset.

In the **results section**, the authors provide performance metrics based on the NeRF synthetic dataset, confirming its use in their evaluations. They describe the dataset as containing 8 synthetic scenes with specific characteristics, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's context.

Now, I will look into the **references section** to find the full citation for the NeRF synthetic dataset. The relevant citation is:

- For the **NeRF synthetic dataset**, the citation is:
  > B. Mildenhall, P. P. Srinivasan, M. Tancik, J. T. Barron, R. Ramamoorthy, and R. Ng. *NeRF: representing scenes as neural radiance fields for view synthesis*. Communications of the ACM, vol. 65, no. 1, pp. 99â€“106, 2021.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset details, including the dataset name, description, and full citation, ensuring that each entry is complete and accurate. This structured approach will help ensure that I capture all relevant datasets mentioned in the paper.
