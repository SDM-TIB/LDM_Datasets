To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Generating Explanations in Medical Question-Answering by Expectation Maximization Inference over Evidence" by Wei Sun et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions two datasets, **MQAE-diag** and **MQAE**, which are used for evaluating the proposed framework. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for understanding the research.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 3), where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets. In this section, they explain that:

1. **MQAE-diag**: This dataset is derived from the MedMCQA dataset and includes samples from two medical examination databases: the Spanish medical residency exam (MIR) and the United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE). It consists of 8,038 training samples, 995 validation samples, and 987 testing samples.

2. **MQAE**: This dataset is also based on the MedMCQA dataset and contains 15,993 training samples, 2,000 validation samples, and 1,999 testing samples. The questions in this dataset do not include patient descriptions.

The authors also mention that they utilize a document collection from the **StatPearls medical book**, which contains 9,070 medical documents, as the source of textual evidence for their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

- For **MedMCQA dataset**, the citation is:
  > Pal, A., Umapathi, L.K., Sankarasubbu, M. *MedMCQA: A large-scale multi-subject multi-choice dataset for medical domain question answering*. In Conference on Health, Inference, and Learning, pp. 248â€“260, PMLR, 2022.

- For **StatPearls medical book**, the citation is:
  > StatPearls Publishing. *StatPearls*. Available at: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK430685/.

With this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
