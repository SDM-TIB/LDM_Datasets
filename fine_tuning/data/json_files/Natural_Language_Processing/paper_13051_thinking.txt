To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Inherent Redundancy in Spiking Neural Networks" by Man Yao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for experiments. In this case, the authors discuss their experimental results and mention that they conducted experiments using five event-based datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets in detail. Here, they explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments:

1. **DVS128 Gesture Dataset**: Captured by a 128x128 pixel DVS128 camera, this dataset includes hand gestures.
2. **DVS128 Gait-Day Dataset**: This dataset contains human gait data recorded during the day, also captured by a DVS128 camera.
3. **DVS128 Gait-Night Dataset**: Similar to the Gait-Day dataset, but recorded at night.
4. **DailyAction-DVS Dataset**: Acquired using a DAVIS346 camera, this dataset includes various daily actions.
5. **HAR-DVS Dataset**: The largest event-based human activity recognition dataset, containing 300 classes and 107,646 samples.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. 

The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **DVS128 Gesture Dataset**:
  > Arnon Amir et al. "A low power, fully event-based gesture recognition system." In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 7243–7252, 2017.

- For **DVS128 Gait-Day Dataset**:
  > Yanxiang Wang et al. "Ev-gait: Event-based robust gait recognition using dynamic vision sensors." In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 6358–6367, 2019.

  > Yanxiang Wang et al. "Event-stream representation for human gaits identification using deep neural networks." IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 44(7):3436–3449, 2022.

- For **DailyAction-DVS Dataset**:
  > The citation for this dataset is not explicitly mentioned in the provided text, so I will need to look for it in the references or assume it is from the authors' previous work.

- For **HAR-DVS Dataset**:
  > Xiao Wang et al. "Hardvs: Revisiting human activity recognition with dynamic vision sensors." arXiv preprint arXiv:2211.09648, 2022.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, facilitating further exploration and validation of the findings presented in the paper.
