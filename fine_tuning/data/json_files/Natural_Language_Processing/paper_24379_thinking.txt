To extract datasets from the research paper titled "AUTODETECT: Towards a Unified Framework for Automated Weakness Detection in Large Language Models" by Jiale Cheng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract discusses the framework AUTODETECT and its application to various tasks, which may imply the use of specific datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, I will look for any specific names of datasets or benchmarks that are utilized in their experiments.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention several datasets in the context of their experiments:

1. **IFEval Dataset**: This dataset is used to evaluate instruction-following capabilities and consists of 541 verifiable instructions.
   
2. **GSM8k Dataset**: This dataset is a popular benchmark for evaluating mathematical problem-solving capabilities, particularly focusing on math word problems.

3. **MATH Dataset**: Another dataset used for assessing mathematical capabilities, specifically designed for evaluating models on math problems.

4. **HumanEval Dataset**: This dataset is utilized for coding tasks and includes 164 carefully designed test cases created by human experts.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to retrieve the full citations for these datasets:

- For **IFEval Dataset**, the citation is:

- For **MATH Dataset**, the citation is:

With these citations in hand, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing. This ensures that I have accurately documented the datasets used in the research and their respective citations.
