To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Balanced Multi-modal Federated Learning via Cross-Modal Infiltration" by Yunfeng Fan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information and provide full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions "extensive experiments over popular datasets," which indicates that datasets are used, but I need to find their specific names.

Next, I will look into **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors typically provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used in their experiments. This section is crucial as it will likely contain the names, descriptions, and characteristics of the datasets.

Upon reviewing section 4.1, I find the following datasets mentioned:

1. **CREMA-D**: This dataset is described as an audio-visual dataset for emotion recognition, consisting of 7,442 video clips divided into training and testing sets. The emotional states are categorized into six classes: happy, sad, angry, fear, disgust, and neutral.

2. **AVE**: This dataset is an audio-visual video dataset for event localization, containing 4,143 video clips across 28 event classes, with both auditory and visual tracks.

3. **CrisisMMD**: This dataset consists of annotated image-tweet pairs collected during natural disasters, used for a classification task of Informative vs. Not Informative, with 9,601 samples for training and 1,534 for testing.

Next, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for these datasets. The citations are essential for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations I find are:

- For **CREMA-D**:
  > Houwei Cao, David G Cooper, Michael K Keutmann, Ruben C Gur, Ani Nenkova, and Ragini Verma. *CREMA-D: Crowd-sourced emotional multimodal actors dataset*. IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing, 5(4):377–390, 2014.

- For **AVE**:
  > Yapeng Tian, Jing Shi, Bochen Li, Zhiyao Duan, and Chenliang Xu. *Audio-visual event localization in unconstrained videos*. In Proceedings of the European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), pages 247–263, 2018.

- For **CrisisMMD**:
  > Firoj Alam, Ferda Ofli, and Muhammad Imran. *CrisisMMD: Multimodal Twitter datasets from natural disasters*. In Proceedings of the International AAAI Conference on Web and Social Media, 2018.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or processing. This ensures that I have accurately captured all necessary details for each dataset mentioned in the paper.
