To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Stock Recommendations for Individual Investors: A Temporal Graph Network Approach with Diversification-Enhancing Contrastive Learning" by Youngbin Lee et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study and may mention specific datasets used for experiments or evaluations.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experiment)**, where the authors describe their experimental setup. This section typically contains detailed information about the datasets used, including their sources, characteristics, and any preprocessing steps taken. The authors mention using mock trading data obtained from a stock trading platform called **AlphaSquare**, which is crucial for my dataset extraction.

In this section, the authors also describe the construction of **7 sub-datasets** from the entire dataset, detailing the time periods and the number of users, items, and interactions for each sub-dataset. This information is essential for understanding the scope and scale of the datasets used in their experiments.

Now, I will compile the specific datasets mentioned:

1. **Mock Trading Dataset from AlphaSquare**: This dataset includes user buy orders collected from real users over a period from March 15, 2021, to July 3, 2023. The dataset is filtered to exclude high-frequency trading users and stocks with unstable price movements.

2. **Sub-datasets**: The authors created 7 sub-datasets based on the mock trading data, each covering a 9-month period with specific user and item counts, as well as interaction counts. The details of these sub-datasets are summarized in a table within the paper.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets or methodologies referenced in the paper. However, since the mock trading dataset is proprietary to AlphaSquare, it may not have a formal citation. I will note that the dataset is derived from a specific platform.

Finally, I will summarize the datasets in a structured manner, ensuring that I include the necessary details and citations for each dataset. This will provide a clear overview of the datasets used in the research and their relevance to the study's findings.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for review or further processing.
