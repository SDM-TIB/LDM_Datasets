To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Minimal Framework for Optimizing Vaccination Protocols Targeting Highly Mutable Pathogens" by Saeed Mahdisoltani et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the optimization of vaccination protocols and mentions the use of stochastic simulations, which may imply the presence of datasets related to these simulations.

Next, I will look for any specific datasets in the **results and discussion sections**. These sections often contain references to datasets used for analysis or comparison. If the authors mention any datasets, I will note their names and any relevant details provided.

I will also check the **methods section** for any descriptions of experimental setups or simulations that might involve datasets. This section often provides insights into the data collection process, including any publicly available datasets or proprietary data used in the study.

After identifying potential datasets, I will consult the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, if the authors mention using a dataset from a previous study, I will ensure to capture the full citation for that study. If they describe a new dataset they created, I will document the details provided in the paper, including the dataset's name, purpose, and any relevant metrics or characteristics.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant datasets from the paper while adhering to proper citation practices.
