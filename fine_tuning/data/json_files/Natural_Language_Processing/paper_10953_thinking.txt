To extract datasets from the research paper titled "#REVAL: A Semantic Evaluation Framework for Hashtag Recommendation" by Areej Alsini et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on **three large datasets**, which indicates that datasets are indeed present in the paper. I will look for specific names and descriptions of these datasets.

Next, I will examine **section 4 (Experiments)**, particularly **subsection 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors typically provide detailed information about the datasets used in their experiments. Here, I will look for the names of the datasets, their characteristics, and any relevant statistics that describe their content.

In this paper, the authors mention three datasets:

1. **AU Trends Dataset**: This dataset consists of tweets collected using 16 Australian trending hashtags, resulting in 272,686 tweets with 15,375 unique hashtags. The dataset is described in detail, including the number of hashtags and tweets after preprocessing.

2. **US Trends Dataset**: Similar to the AU Trends dataset, this dataset was collected using 14 US trending hashtags, yielding 146,963 tweets and 13,976 unique hashtags. The authors provide statistics on the number of hashtags and tweets after preprocessing.

3. **Health Dataset**: This dataset contains health-related tweets collected in 2015 from 16 news agencies, with a total of 11,210 tweets and 2,710 unique hashtags. The authors reference a previous work for this dataset.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The citations I will extract are:

- For the **AU Trends Dataset**: The dataset is based on tweets collected on March 13, 2020, but the paper does not provide a specific citation for it since it is a new dataset created by the authors.

- For the **US Trends Dataset**: Similar to the AU Trends dataset, this dataset is also created by the authors and does not have a separate citation.

- For the **Health Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Karami, A., Gangopadhyay, A., Zhou, B., & Kharrazi, H. (2018). Fuzzy approach topic discovery in health and medical corpora. *International Journal of Fuzzy Systems*, 20, 1334â€“1345.

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, I will compile this into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and citations. This will ensure that I have a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
