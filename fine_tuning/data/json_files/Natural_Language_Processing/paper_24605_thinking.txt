To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Robust Pareto Design of GaN HEMTs for Millimeter-Wave Applications" by Rafael Perez Martinez et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a concise overview of the study, and while it may not explicitly mention datasets, it often highlights the key objectives and methods used, which can lead to identifying relevant datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to see if the authors reference any existing datasets or benchmarks that are crucial for their research. This section often discusses the background and context of the study, which may include datasets used in previous works.

I will then examine the **methodology section**, particularly any subsections that detail the experimental setup or simulations. Here, the authors may describe the specific datasets they used for their simulations or analyses. For instance, if they mention using a specific model or data from a previous study, I will note that down.

In the **results section**, I will look for any tables, figures, or discussions that reference datasets. This section often summarizes findings and may include comparisons with existing datasets or benchmarks.

After identifying potential datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets.

For example, if the authors mention using a specific GaN HEMT model from a previous study, I will look for that study in the references and extract the full citation. Similarly, if they refer to a dataset used for performance evaluation, I will ensure to find its citation as well.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I capture all relevant datasets accurately and comprehensively.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for output, ensuring they are clear and ready for any further processing or review.
