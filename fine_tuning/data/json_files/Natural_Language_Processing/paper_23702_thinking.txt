To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MHS-VM: Multi-Head Scanning in Parallel Subspaces for Vision Mamba," I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experimental results sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study but may not mention specific datasets. Therefore, I will pay close attention to the **introduction** where the authors often discuss the context of their research and may mention datasets used for evaluation.

In the **experimental results section (4.1)**, the authors explicitly state that they evaluate their module on three publicly available medical image datasets: **ISIC17**, **ISIC18**, and **Synapse**. This is a clear indication that these datasets are central to their experiments.

Next, I will look for detailed descriptions of these datasets within the same section or elsewhere in the paper. The authors mention that these datasets are widely used in segmentation research, which suggests they are well-known and likely have established citations.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

1. For **ISIC17**, the citation is:
   > Matt Berseth. *ISIC 2017 - Skin Lesion Analysis Towards Melanoma Detection*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1703.00523, 2017.

2. For **ISIC18**, the citation is:
   > Noel Codella, Veronica Rotemberg, Philipp Tschandl, M Emre Celebi, Stephen Dusza, David Gutman, Brian Helba, Aadi Kalloo, Konstantinos Liopyris, Michael Marchetti, et al. *Skin Lesion Analysis Toward Melanoma Detection 2018: A Challenge Hosted by the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC)*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1902.03368, 2019.

3. For **Synapse**, the citation is:
   > Bennett Landman, Zhoubing Xu, J Igelsias, Martin Styner, T Langerak, and Arno Klein. *MICCAI Multi-Atlas Labeling Beyond the Cranial Vault—Workshop Challenge*. In Proc. MICCAI Multi-Atlas Labeling Beyond Cranial Vault—Workshop Challenge, volume 5, page 12, 2015.

With these citations in hand, I will now summarize the datasets and their citations in a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly identified along with its full citation for future reference.

This process ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations, which is essential for proper documentation and academic integrity.
