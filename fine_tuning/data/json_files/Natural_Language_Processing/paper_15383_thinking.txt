To extract datasets from the research paper titled "LSA64: An Argentinian Sign Language Dataset" by Franco Ronchetti et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract introduces the LSA64 dataset, which consists of 3200 videos of 64 different signs from Argentinian Sign Language (LSA). This indicates that the dataset is central to the paper.

Next, I will look into **section 1.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors discuss various datasets for sign language recognition. They mention that the LSA64 dataset is specifically designed for sign-level recognition and is the focus of their research. This section confirms that LSA64 is the primary dataset being presented.

In **section 1.2 (Argentinian Sign Language Dataset (LSA64))**, the authors provide detailed information about the LSA64 dataset, including the number of signs, videos, subjects, and the recording conditions. They emphasize that this dataset is publicly available and serves as a significant contribution to the field of sign language recognition.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the LSA64 dataset. The authors reference their own work, which is crucial for providing the correct citation. The relevant citation for the dataset is:

> Franco Ronchetti, Facundo Quiroga, CÃ©sar Estrebou, Laura Lanzarini, and Alejandro Rosete. *LSA64: An Argentinian Sign Language Dataset*. In Proceedings of the IBERAMIA: Iberoamerican Society of Artificial Intelligence, 2016.

Now, I will compile the information I have gathered about the dataset into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation as required. The LSA64 dataset is the only dataset explicitly mentioned in the paper, so I will focus solely on that.

After completing this process, I will have a clear and concise entry for the LSA64 dataset, ready for further processing or review.
