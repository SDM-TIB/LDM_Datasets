To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Putting Context in Context: the Impact of Discussion Structure on Text Classification" by Nicolò Penzo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections that explicitly mention datasets**. The abstract mentions a "large dataset for stance detection in English," which indicates that a dataset is indeed used in the research.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Kialo Dataset for Stance Detection)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset they utilized. Here, they describe the Kialo platform and how the dataset was structured, including the number of instances and the nature of the data.

The Kialo dataset is described as follows:
- **Stance Detection Kialo Dataset (SDK)**: This dataset contains 122,681 training instances, 7,447 validation instances, and 8,211 test instances. Each instance includes the target claim, the discussion chain, the stance of each claim versus its parent claim, the user ID of each claim, and the timestamp of each claim.

In addition to the Kialo dataset, the authors mention that they also experimented with two smaller datasets for stance detection and abusive language detection, but they do not provide specific names or details for these datasets in the sections I have reviewed.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Kialo dataset. The relevant citation is:
- For the Kialo dataset:
  > Thomas Scialom, Serra Sinem Tekiroğlu, Jacopo Staiano, and Marco Guerini. *Toward stance-based personas for opinionated dialogues*. In Findings of the Association for Computational Linguistics: EMNLP 2020, pages 2625–2635, Online. Association for Computational Linguistics.

Since the paper does not provide full citations for the other smaller datasets, I will only include the Kialo dataset in my final output.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and citation.

This process ensures that I have accurately extracted and documented the dataset information from the research paper, focusing on clarity and completeness.
