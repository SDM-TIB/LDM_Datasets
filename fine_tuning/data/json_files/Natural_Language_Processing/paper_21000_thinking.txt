To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Universal representations for financial transactional data: embracing local, global, and external contexts" by Alexandra Bazarova et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for evaluation. The introduction typically outlines the context and significance of the research, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments and results sections** where the authors are likely to describe the datasets in detail. In this paper, the authors mention using several datasets for validation, including:

1. **Churn Dataset**: This dataset is used to identify potential customers about to leave the bank. It contains transaction records and is utilized for both global and local validation tasks.

2. **Default Dataset**: Similar to the Churn dataset, this dataset is used for classifying clients based on their ability to repay loans. It also includes transaction records and is used for local validation tasks.

3. **HSBC Dataset**: This dataset is used for fraud detection, containing transaction records with labels indicating whether each transaction was made by the client or was fraudulent.

4. **Age Dataset**: This dataset is used to predict the age group of bank clients based on their transaction history. It differs from the others as it does not include exact timestamps for transactions.

5. **Real-world Private Dataset**: This dataset is provided by a major bank and contains anonymized data of clients, including characteristics such as age and gender.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. 

For example, I will look for the following citations:

- For the **Churn Dataset**, I will find the original source or publication that introduced it.
- For the **Default Dataset**, I will do the same.
- For the **HSBC Dataset**, I will locate the relevant competition or publication.
- For the **Age Dataset**, I will find the source that describes it.
- For the **Real-world Private Dataset**, I will note that it is proprietary and may not have a public citation.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as they are essential for academic integrity and further research.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for easy reference and use in future research or applications.
