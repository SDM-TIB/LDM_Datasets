To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Prompt-enhanced Federated Content Representation Learning for Cross-domain Recommendation" by Lei Guo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that extensive experiments were conducted on two real-world datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed present. I will look for specific names or descriptions of these datasets.

Next, I will examine the **experimental setup section (Section 4.2)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention two pairs of domains: **"Office-Arts"** and **"OnlineRetail-Pantry"**. I will note down the details provided about these datasets, including their sources and characteristics.

In this section, the authors describe the datasets as follows:
1. **Office-Arts Dataset**: This dataset is derived from Amazon, which records users' rating behaviors on products in the Office and Arts domains.
2. **OnlineRetail-Pantry Dataset**: This dataset comes from the OnlineRetail platform, which captures users' purchase histories on products in the Pantry domain.

I will also check the **appendix** for any additional details or statistics about the datasets, such as the number of users, items, interactions, and average sequence lengths, which can provide further context.

After gathering the necessary information, I will look into the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. However, since these datasets are derived from existing platforms (Amazon and OnlineRetail), I will note that the datasets themselves may not have formal citations but are based on the respective platforms.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, ensuring to include the names, descriptions, and any relevant statistics, while also acknowledging the sources from which these datasets are derived.

Now, I will prepare the dataset entries for documentation, ensuring that I include all necessary details for clarity and future reference.
