To extract datasets from the research paper titled "AWESOME: GPU Memory-constrained Long Document Summarization using Memory Mechanism and Global Salient Content" by Shuyang Cao and Lu Wang, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that the framework is evaluated on "diverse genres of text, including government reports, meeting transcripts, screenplays, scientific papers, and novels," which suggests that multiple datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental setup section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this paper, the authors explicitly list five datasets:

1. **GovReport**: This dataset consists of long reports and their summaries written by government research agencies. The paper states that it contains 974 training samples, 272 validation samples, and 973 test samples.

2. **QMSum**: This dataset is a query-focused long meeting transcript summarization dataset. It includes 17,516 training samples, 1,257 validation samples, and 1,795 test samples.

3. **SummScreen**: This dataset contains transcripts of TV series and has 9,409 training samples, 9,070 validation samples, and 6,421 test samples.

4. **arXiv**: This dataset consists of scientific papers and their abstracts, with 203,037 training samples, 6,436 validation samples, and 6,440 test samples.

5. **BookSum**: This dataset is used for summarizing full novels and includes 1,294 training samples, 381 validation samples, and 273 test samples.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:

- For **GovReport**, the citation is:

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations into a structured format for further processing or review.
