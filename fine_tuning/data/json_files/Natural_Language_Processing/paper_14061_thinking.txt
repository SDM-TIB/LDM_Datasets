To extract datasets from the research paper titled "STRUCTCHART: PERCEPTION, STRUCTURING, REASONING FOR VISUAL CHART UNDERSTANDING" by Renqiu Xia et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors have created a synthetic chart dataset termed **SimChart9K**, which is a strong lead for dataset extraction.

Next, I will examine **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors typically provide details about the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention several datasets:

1. **ChartQA**: A large-scale visual reasoning dataset with 20,882 charts collected from online sources. This dataset is crucial for evaluating the performance of their proposed method.

2. **PlotQA**: A synthetic dataset that contains 28.9 million question-answer pairs across 224,377 plots. This dataset is also significant for the experiments conducted in the paper.

3. **FigureQA**: A visual reasoning corpus consisting of over one million human-designed question-answer pairs. This dataset is relevant for the reasoning tasks discussed.

4. **Chart2Text**: A dataset for automatic summarization of statistical charts, yielding a total of 8,305 charts with annotations. This dataset is important for the summarization tasks.

5. **SimChart9K**: The synthetic dataset produced by the authors, composed of 9,098 charts and associated data annotations in CSV format. This dataset is particularly highlighted as a contribution of the paper.

After identifying these datasets, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that all relevant datasets from the paper are documented accurately with their respective citations.
