To extract datasets from the research paper titled "UPAM: Unified Prompt Attack in Text-to-Image Generation Models Against Both Textual Filters and Visual Checkers" by Duo Peng, Qiuhong Ke, and Jun Liu, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the robustness of text-to-image (T2I) models and mentions extensive experiments, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors highlight the security concerns related to T2I models and the need for effective adversarial attacks. However, they do not explicitly mention any datasets in this section.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**. Here, the authors state that they follow previous works and utilize the paired text-image data from the **Microsoft COCO dataset** for their experiments. This is a significant finding, as it indicates the dataset used for their evaluations.

To ensure I have the correct details, I will check the **references section** for the full citation of the Microsoft COCO dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Lin, T.-Y., Maire, M., Belongie, S., Hays, J., Perona, P., Raman, D., Dollár, P., and Zitnick, C. L. *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. In Computer Vision–ECCV 2014: 13th European Conference, Zurich, Switzerland, September 6-12, 2014, Proceedings, Part V 13, pp. 740–755. Springer, 2014.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the findings:

1. **Dataset Name**: Microsoft COCO
   - **Description**: The dataset consists of paired text-image data used for training and testing the UPAM framework, specifically targeting 10 classes deemed "harmful."
   - **Full Citation**: Lin, T.-Y., Maire, M., Belongie, S., Hays, J., Perona, P., Raman, D., Dollár, P., and Zitnick, C. L. *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. In Computer Vision–ECCV 2014: 13th European Conference, Zurich, Switzerland, September 6-12, 2014, Proceedings, Part V 13, pp. 740–755. Springer, 2014.

With this information, I can now compile the dataset entry for further processing or review.
