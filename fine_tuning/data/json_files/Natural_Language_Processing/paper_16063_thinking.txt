To extract datasets from the research paper titled "HELPSTEER: Multi-attribute Helpfulness Dataset for STEERLM" by Zhilin Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors collected HELPSTEER, a multi-attribute helpfulness dataset with 37k samples annotated for various aspects of helpfulness. This indicates that HELPSTEER is a primary dataset of interest.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for any additional context or details about the datasets. The introduction discusses the need for a more refined understanding of helpfulness in model training and mentions the HELPSTEER dataset, reinforcing its significance.

In the **datasets section (Section 3)**, the authors provide a detailed overview of HELPSTEER, including its size (37k conversations) and the attributes it covers (correctness, coherence, complexity, verbosity, and overall helpfulness). This section confirms that HELPSTEER is the main dataset being discussed.

I will also check the **related works section** to see if any other datasets are mentioned. The authors reference other datasets like Open Assistant and HH-RLHF, but they focus on the limitations of these datasets compared to HELPSTEER. 

In the **experiments section**, the authors describe how they utilized the HELPSTEER dataset to train their model, further emphasizing its importance. They also mention that they are releasing this dataset under a CC-BY-4.0 license, which is crucial for citation purposes.

Now, I will gather the full citation for the HELPSTEER dataset from the paper. The citation is as follows:
> Zhilin Wang, Yi Dong, Jiaqi Zeng, Virginia Adams, Makesh Narsimhan Sreedhar, Daniel Egert, Olivier Delalleau, Jane Polak Scowcroft, Neel Kant, Aidan Swope, Oleksii Kuchaiev. *HELPSTEER: Multi-attribute Helpfulness Dataset for STEERLM*. NVIDIA. Available at: https://huggingface.co/datasets/nvidia/HelpSteer.

Since HELPSTEER is the primary dataset discussed in the paper, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use.

In summary, I have identified and extracted the HELPSTEER dataset, including its details and full citation, ensuring that I have captured all necessary information for future reference or processing.
