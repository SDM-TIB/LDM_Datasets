To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Leader Reward for POMO-Based Neural Combinatorial Optimization" by Chaoyang Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that the proposed method is applicable to various combinatorial optimization problems, which suggests that datasets may be involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 5) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. Here, I will look for specific names of datasets, their characteristics, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

In the experiments section, the authors mention using the **TSP (Traveling Salesman Problem)** and **CVRP (Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem)** datasets. They also refer to the **TSPLib** and **CVRPLib** datasets, which are standard benchmark datasets for these types of problems.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the **References section** of the paper:

1. **TSPLib**: 
   > Reinelt, G. (1991). *TSPLIB - A Traveling Salesman Problem Library*. ORSA Journal on Computing, 3(4), 376-384.

2. **CVRPLib**: 
   > Uchoa, E., Pecin, D., Pessoa, A., Poggi, M., Vidal, T., & Subramanian, A. (2017). *New Benchmark Instances for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem*. European Journal of Operational Research, 257(3), 845-858.

Additionally, I will note that the authors also reference specific instances from these libraries, such as **TSP100**, **CVRP100**, etc., but the original datasets are what I need to cite.

After compiling this information, I will ensure that I have a clear and concise description of each dataset, including its purpose and any relevant details mentioned in the paper.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that all citations are accurately represented.
