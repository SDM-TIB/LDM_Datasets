To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Evaluating the transferability potential of deep learning models for climate downscaling" by Ayush Prasad et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the study's objectives and the datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that multiple climate datasets are utilized for training deep learning models, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Data)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used in their experiments. This section is crucial as it provides the names, descriptions, and specific details about each dataset. The authors mention five datasets:

1. **ERA5**: This dataset is described as a state-of-the-art atmospheric reanalysis dataset produced by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). It provides hourly data at a spatial resolution of 0.25° × 0.25° and includes various climate variables.

2. **MERRA2**: The Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2, is another atmospheric reanalysis dataset with a spatial resolution of 0.5° × 0.625°. The authors specify the climate variables they utilize from this dataset.

3. **NOAA CFSR**: The NOAA Climate Forecast System Reanalysis is a global dataset that includes various climate variables at a spatial resolution of 0.5° × 0.5°.

4. **NorESM**: This dataset is based on the Norwegian Earth System Model (NorESM2) and includes data from two different runs with varying resolutions. The authors provide details about the variables and the time period covered.

5. **Data Preprocessing**: While this section discusses the preprocessing steps, it does not introduce a new dataset but rather explains how the existing datasets are prepared for model training.

After identifying these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are essential for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations I will extract are:

- For **ERA5**:
  > Hersbach, H., Bell, B., Berrisford, P., Hirahara, S., Horányi, A., Muñoz-Sabater, J., Nicolas, J., Peubey, C., Radu, R., Schepers, D., et al. *The ERA5 global reanalysis*. Quarterly Journal of the Royal Meteorological Society, 146(730):1999–2049, 2020.

- For **MERRA2**:

- For **NOAA CFSR**:
  > Saha, S., Moorthi, S., Pan, H.-L., Wu, X., Wang, J., Nadiga, S., Tripp, P., Kistler, R., Woollen, J., Behringer, D., et al. *The NCEP Climate Forecast System Reanalysis*. Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society, 91(8):1015–1058, 2010.

- For **NorESM**:
  > Bentsen, M., Bethke, I., Debernard, J. B., Iversen, T., Kirkevåg, A., Seland, Ø., Drange, H., Roelandt, C., Seierstad, I. A., Hoose, C., et al. *The Norwegian Earth System Model, NorESM1-M–Part 1: Description and basic evaluation of the physical climate*. Geoscientific Model Development, 6(3):687–720, 2013.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
