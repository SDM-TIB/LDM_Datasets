To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Collaborative and Distributed Bayesian Optimization via Consensus" by Xubo Yue et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the use of **simulated datasets** and a **real-world collaborative sensor design experiment**, indicating that there are datasets involved.

Next, I will look for specific sections that typically contain dataset information, such as **section 5 (Simulation Studies)** and **section 6 (Case Study)**. In these sections, the authors describe their experiments and the datasets used.

In **section 5**, the authors mention using several testing functions from the **Virtual Library of Simulation Experiments**. They specifically refer to datasets associated with functions like **Levy-D**, **Shekel-10**, **Branin**, and **Ackley-D**. I will note these functions as datasets used in their simulations.

In **section 6**, the authors describe a case study involving a **biosensor design optimization**. They mention that the performance of the biosensor was calculated using **COMSOL Multiphysics** simulations, which indicates that the data generated from these simulations is also a dataset relevant to their research.

Now, I will compile the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. **Virtual Library of Simulation Experiments**: This is a collection of test functions and datasets used for benchmarking optimization algorithms. The citation is:
   > Surjanovic, S. and Bingham, D. (2013). *Virtual library of simulation experiments: test functions and datasets*. Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, BC, Canada.

2. **Levy Functions**: These are a family of functions used in optimization problems. The specific citation for the Levy function is not provided in the paper, but it is commonly referenced in optimization literature.

3. **Shekel-10 Function**: This function is a well-known test function in optimization. The citation for the original Shekel function is not provided in the paper, but it is often referenced in optimization contexts.

4. **Branin Function**: This is another standard test function in optimization. The citation for the Branin function is also not explicitly provided in the paper, but it is widely recognized in the field.

5. **Ackley Function**: Similar to the Branin function, this is a standard test function in optimization. The citation for the Ackley function is not provided in the paper but is commonly referenced.

6. **COMSOL Multiphysics**: The software used for the biosensor simulations. The citation for COMSOL is:
   > COMSOL Inc. (2021). *COMSOL MultiphysicsÂ®*. Available at: https://www.comsol.com/comsol-multiphysics.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets in a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is properly cited for future reference. This will provide a clear overview of the datasets used in the research and their respective sources.
