To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Detector Collapse: Backdooring Object Detection to Catastrophic Overload or Blindness" by Hangtao Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, and the introduction often outlines the datasets used for evaluation.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of object detection and mention that their experiments were conducted on various benchmarks. This suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors explicitly mention using two datasets for their experiments: **MS-COCO 2014** and **PASCAL VOC (VOC) 07&12**. 

In the **experiments section**, they describe the evaluation metrics and the detectors used, confirming that these datasets are indeed the ones utilized for their experiments. 

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the **References section**:

1. For **MS-COCO 2014**, the citation is:
   > Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, Serge Belongie, James Hays, Pietro Perona, Deva Ramanan, Piotr Dollar, and C Lawrence Zitnick. *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. In European Conference on Computer Vision, pages 740–755, 2014.

2. For **PASCAL VOC**, the citation is:
   > Mark Everingham, Luc Van Gool, Christopher KI Williams, John Winn, and Andrew Zisserman. *The PASCAL Visual Object Classes (VOC) Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, pages 303–338, 2010.

After collecting this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all details are accurately represented for future reference or processing.
