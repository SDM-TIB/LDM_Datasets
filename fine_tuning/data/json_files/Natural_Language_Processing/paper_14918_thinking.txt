To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On the Over-Memorization During Natural, Robust and Catastrophic Overfitting" by Runqi Lin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to look for any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study and may mention datasets used for experiments. The introduction often elaborates on the context and may specify datasets relevant to the research.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this paper, the authors mention conducting experiments on benchmark datasets such as **CIFAR-10**, **CIFAR-100**, **SVHN**, and **Tiny-ImageNet**. I will take note of these datasets and any specific details provided about them, such as their characteristics or the context in which they were used.

I will also check the **appendices** for any additional information regarding the datasets, as sometimes supplementary details are provided there.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research. 

For example, I will look for citations related to:
- **CIFAR-10** and **CIFAR-100**, which are commonly referenced datasets in machine learning research.
- **SVHN**, which is another well-known dataset for digit recognition.
- **Tiny-ImageNet**, which is a smaller version of the ImageNet dataset.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for easy reference and further processing.
