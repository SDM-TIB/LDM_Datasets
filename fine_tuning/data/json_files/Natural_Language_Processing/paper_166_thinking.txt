To extract datasets from the research paper titled "pioNER: Datasets and Baselines for Armenian Named Entity Recognition" by Tsolak Ghukasyan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the creation of both silver- and gold-standard datasets for named entity recognition, which indicates that there are at least two datasets to look for. The introduction further emphasizes the lack of annotated corpora for the Armenian language and the authors' efforts to address this gap.

Next, I will focus on the **dataset extraction** section, which is likely to provide detailed descriptions of the datasets. In this section, the authors describe the following datasets:

1. **Silver-standard corpus**: This dataset consists of 163,000 tokens automatically generated and annotated from Wikipedia. It is used for training named entity recognition models.

2. **Gold-standard corpus**: This dataset contains 53,453 tokens and 2,566 sentences manually annotated with named entities (people, organizations, and locations) from news articles. It serves as a benchmark for evaluating named entity recognition systems.

I will also check the **experiments** and **conclusion** sections to confirm the datasets' usage and significance in the research. The conclusion reiterates the importance of both datasets for future research in named entity recognition for the Armenian language.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the **references section**. The citations are as follows:

- For the **silver-standard corpus**, since it is based on Wikipedia, I will cite the original work that describes the methodology for generating such datasets:
  > Nothman, J., Ringland, N., Radford, W., Murphy, T., & Curran, J. R. (2013). Learning multilingual named entity recognition from Wikipedia. *Artificial Intelligence*, 194, 151â€“175.

- For the **gold-standard corpus**, it is manually annotated and based on news articles from ilur.am. While there may not be a specific citation for this dataset, I will reference the source of the news articles:
  > ilur.am. (2012-2018). News articles. Retrieved from http://ilur.am/news/newsline.html

After compiling this information, I will prepare to format the dataset entries according to the specified structure, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
