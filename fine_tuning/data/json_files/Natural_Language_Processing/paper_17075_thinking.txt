To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Distributed Inference and Fine-tuning of Large Language Models Over The Internet" by Alexander Borzunov et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the development of a decentralized system for running large language models, but it does not specify any datasets at this point.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section 4) closely, as this is where datasets are typically detailed. In this section, the authors describe their experiments with two specific models: **Llama 2 (70B)** and **BLOOM (176B)**. However, they do not mention any specific datasets used for training or evaluation in the experiments.

I will also check the **background and related work sections** to see if any datasets are referenced in the context of previous studies or methodologies. The authors discuss various techniques and algorithms related to large language models, but again, no specific datasets are mentioned.

Since the paper does not provide explicit dataset names or descriptions, I will look at the **References section** to see if any datasets are cited indirectly through the works referenced. However, the references primarily focus on algorithms, models, and techniques rather than specific datasets.

After thoroughly reviewing the paper, it appears that there are no datasets explicitly mentioned or cited in the context of this research. Therefore, I will conclude that there are no datasets to extract from this paper.

In summary, I will document my findings as follows:

1. **No datasets were explicitly mentioned in the paper.**
2. **No references to datasets were found in the context of the experiments or methodologies.**

Since there are no datasets to cite, I will not provide any citations. This process highlights the importance of thorough reading and understanding of the paper to accurately extract relevant information.
