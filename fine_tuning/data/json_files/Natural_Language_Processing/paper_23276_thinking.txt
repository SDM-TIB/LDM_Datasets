To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Action-OOD: An End-to-End Skeleton-Based Model for Robust Out-of-Distribution Human Action Detection" by Jing Xu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on several datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Dataset description)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention three datasets:

1. **NTU-RGB+D 60**: This dataset consists of 60 motion categories and 56,880 video samples, specifically utilizing 3D skeleton sequence data. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Shahroudy, A., Liu, J., Ng, T.T., Wang, G. (2016). *NTU RGB+D: A large scale dataset for 3D human activity analysis*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pp. 1010–1019.

2. **NTU-RGB+D 120**: An extension of the NTU-RGB+D 60 dataset, it includes 120 action categories. The citation is:
   > Liu, J., Wang, G., Hu, P., Duan, L.Y., Kot, A.C. (2019). *NTU RGB+D 120: A large-scale benchmark for 3D human activity understanding*. IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 42(10), 2684–2701.

3. **Kinetics-400**: This dataset is the largest unconstrained action recognition dataset, covering 400 action classes. The citation is:
   > Kay, W., Carreira, J., Simonyan, K., et al. (2017). *The Kinetics human action video dataset*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1705.06950.

After identifying these datasets, I will verify their usage in the **experiments section** to confirm that they were indeed utilized in the authors' evaluations. The authors mention that they conducted extensive experiments on these datasets, which aligns with the information gathered.

Finally, I will compile the dataset descriptions and their full citations into a structured format for clarity and future reference. This process ensures that I have accurately captured all relevant dataset information from the paper while adhering to the importance of providing full citations.
