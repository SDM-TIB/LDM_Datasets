To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Reinforcement Learning Framework for Thoracic Diseases Classification via Prior Knowledge Guidance" by Weizhi Nie et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. In the abstract, the authors mention that their method's performance was demonstrated using the **NIH ChestX-ray14** and **CheXpert** datasets. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for the experiments conducted in the study.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (Section 4) to gather more details about these datasets. In Section 4.1, the authors provide specific information about the datasets used:

1. **NIH ChestX-ray14**: This dataset consists of 112,120 frontal-view X-ray images of 30,805 unique patients, and it is used for classifying 14 thoracic abnormal diseases.

2. **CheXpert**: This dataset contains 224,316 chest radiographs of 65,240 unique patients, with 14 observations labeled in radiology reports, capturing uncertainties inherent in radiography interpretation.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **NIH ChestX-ray14**, the citation is:
  > Wang, X., Peng, Y., Lu, L., Lu, Z., Bagheri, M., & Summers, R. M. (2017). ChestX-ray8: Hospital-scale chest X-ray database and benchmarks on weakly-supervised classification and localization of common thorax diseases. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pp. 2097–2106.

- For **CheXpert**, the citation is:
  > Irvin, J., Rajpurkar, P., Ko, M., Yu, Y., Ciurea-Ilcus, S., Chute, C., Marklund, H., Haghgoo, B., Ball, R., Shpanskaya, K., et al. (2019). CheXpert: A large chest radiograph dataset with uncertainty labels and expert comparison. In Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, pp. 590–597.

Having gathered all the necessary information, I will now compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will facilitate further processing or review of the datasets used in the research.
