SWaT represents a scaled-down version of a real-world industrial water treatment plant. It took 11 days for the data collection process, which run with normal operation mode during the first seven days, and constituted a training dataset. During the later four days, the testbed was implemented by intermittent network and physical attacks, which constituted the labeled testing dataset. The data were collected once every second, containing 51 time-series features, including 25 continuous features and 26 discrete categorical features.",
