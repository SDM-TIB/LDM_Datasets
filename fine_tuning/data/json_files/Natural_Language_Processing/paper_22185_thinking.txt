To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Zonotope-based Symbolic Controller Synthesis for Linear Temporal Logic Specifications" by Wei Ren et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and it may mention specific datasets used for experiments or evaluations.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (if available) or any section that discusses results or evaluations. This section typically contains detailed information about the datasets used, including their names, sizes, and any specific characteristics that are relevant to the study.

I will also check the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned in the paper. This is crucial, as proper citation is necessary for academic integrity and allows others to locate the datasets.

As I read through the paper, I will look for specific phrases like "we used the following datasets" or "the experiments were conducted on" to pinpoint where the authors discuss the datasets.

Once I identify the datasets, I will summarize the key details for each one, including:

1. **Dataset Name**: The official name of the dataset.
2. **Description**: A brief description of what the dataset contains and its relevance to the research.
3. **Citation**: The full citation for the dataset, which may include authors, title, publication venue, and year.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset called "XYZ Dataset" that contains specific data for experiments, I would note it down as follows:

- **XYZ Dataset**: A dataset containing [description of the dataset]. 
  - Citation: Author(s). *Title of the dataset*. Year. [Link or DOI if available].

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for clarity and ease of reference.

Finally, I will ensure that all citations are formatted correctly according to the relevant academic style guide (e.g., APA, IEEE) as specified in the paper or as commonly used in the field.
