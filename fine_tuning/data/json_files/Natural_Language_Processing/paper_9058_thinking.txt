To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Reconfigurable Data Glove for Reconstructing Physical and Virtual Grasps" by Hangxin Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the glove's capabilities, but I need to look for specific datasets used in experiments or evaluations.

Next, I will examine the **experiments and results sections** to find explicit mentions of datasets. In this paper, the authors discuss various modes of the glove (tactile-sensing, VR, and simulation) and their applications, which may involve specific datasets.

In the **experiments section**, I will look for any references to datasets used for training or testing the glove's performance. The authors may describe how they collected data for different tasks, such as grasping or manipulating objects, which could indicate the presence of datasets.

I will also check the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. If the authors refer to existing datasets, I will ensure to note the original sources.

For example, if the paper mentions using a dataset for training the glove's tactile-sensing capabilities, I will look for the citation that provides the dataset's name, authors, title, and publication details.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and that full citations are included. This will involve summarizing the key characteristics of each dataset, such as its purpose, size, and the type of data it contains.

Finally, I will ensure that all dataset entries are formatted correctly and ready for presentation or further analysis, maintaining a clear and organized structure throughout the process.
