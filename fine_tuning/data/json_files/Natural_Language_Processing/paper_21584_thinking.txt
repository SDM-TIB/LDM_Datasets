To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Shaping Realities: Enhancing 3D Generative AI with Fabrication Constraints" by Faraz Faruqi et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections discussing methodology and experiments** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a general overview, but I need to look for specific references to datasets used in the research.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss generative AI tools and their applications in 3D modeling, but they do not explicitly mention any datasets. I will continue to the next sections for more detailed information.

Next, I will examine the **sections that discuss specific methodologies or experiments**. I will look for any references to datasets that were used for training or evaluation purposes. If the paper includes a dedicated section on datasets, that would be ideal, but I will also check for mentions throughout the text.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors reference several tools and methods but do not explicitly name any datasets. However, they mention using existing open-sourced 3D models from platforms like **Thingiverse**. This indicates that the authors may have utilized datasets from this repository, but I need to confirm this by checking the **References section** for any citations related to datasets or tools.

In the **References section**, I will look for any papers or resources that describe datasets used in the context of generative AI and 3D modeling. If the authors have cited specific datasets or repositories, I will extract those citations.

After reviewing the references, I find that the authors have cited **Thingiverse** as a source for 3D models, but they do not provide a formal dataset citation. I will note this as a dataset source but recognize that it may not have a formal citation like traditional datasets.

Since the paper does not provide explicit dataset citations, I will summarize the findings as follows:

1. **Thingiverse**: A platform for sharing 3D models, which the authors reference as a source for existing designs. While it is not a traditional dataset with a formal citation, it is a significant resource for the research.

Now, I will compile this information into a structured format, ensuring to note the lack of formal dataset citations while acknowledging the use of Thingiverse as a source for 3D models in the context of their research.
