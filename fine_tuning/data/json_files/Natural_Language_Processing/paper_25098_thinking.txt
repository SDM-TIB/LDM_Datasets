To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Probabilistic Learning Rate Scheduler with Provable Convergence" by Dahlia Devapriya et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the proposed method is evaluated across a variety of datasets and architectures, which indicates that datasets are likely discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments** section. In this paper, the authors describe their experimental validation and compare their proposed method against several state-of-the-art learning rate schedulers. This is a strong indication that specific datasets will be referenced.

Upon reviewing the **experiments section**, I find that the authors mention three datasets used for their experiments:

1. **CIFAR-10**: A well-known dataset for image classification containing 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class.

2. **CIFAR-100**: Similar to CIFAR-10 but with 100 classes containing 600 images each.

3. **Tiny ImageNet**: A smaller version of the ImageNet dataset, containing 100,000 images across 200 classes, with each class having 500 images.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **CIFAR-10** and **CIFAR-100**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical Report TR-2009, University of Toronto, 2009.

- For **Tiny ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Y. Le and X. Yang. *Tiny ImageNet Visual Recognition Challenge*. [Online]. Available: https://tinyimagenet.herokuapp.com, 2015.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly referenced.

This structured approach will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets used in the research paper, maintaining the integrity of the citations for future reference.
