To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Particle Swarm Optimization with Applications to Maximum Likelihood Estimation and Penalized Negative Binomial Regression" by Junhyung Park et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's focus, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

Next, I will look for specific sections that detail the datasets, such as **section 4 (Experiments)** or any section explicitly labeled as **Datasets**. In this paper, the authors describe their experiments and the datasets used for their analyses.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention three datasets in the context of their experiments:

1. **Weibull-Exponential Dataset**: This dataset is used to demonstrate the application of PSO in estimating parameters for a Weibull-Exponential distribution. The authors reference the original source of the data, which is from Smith and Naylor (1987).

2. **Exponentiated Weibull Dataset**: This dataset is utilized for estimating parameters in the Exponentiated Weibull distribution. The authors cite the original work by Bourguignon et al. (2014) as the source of this dataset.

3. **COVID-19 Dataset**: The authors mention a dataset related to COVID-19, which is used to illustrate the application of PSO in estimating parameters for the Exponentiated Exponential-Inverse Weibull model. The dataset is referenced from Almetwally (2021).

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset from the **References section** of the paper:

- For the **Weibull-Exponential Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Smith, R.L., & Naylor, J.C. (1987). A comparison of maximum likelihood and Bayesian estimators for the three-parameter Weibull distribution. *Applied Statistics*, 36(3), 358-369.

- For the **Exponentiated Weibull Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Bourguignon, M., Silva, R., & Cordeiro, G. (2014). The Weibull-G Family of Probability Distributions. *Journal of Data Science*, 12(1), 53-68.

- For the **COVID-19 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Almetwally, E.M. (2021). Extended odd Weibull inverse Nadarajah-Haghighi distribution with application on COVID-19 in Saudi Arabia. *Mathematical Sciences Letters*, 10(3), 1-15.

After collecting this information, I will summarize the datasets and their citations clearly, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its corresponding citation for future reference or analysis.
