To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Small-scale proxies for large-scale Transformer training instabilities" by Mitchell Wortsman et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, results, and conclusion sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's goals and may hint at the datasets used.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to see if the authors mention any specific datasets that were utilized in their experiments. This section often outlines the context and significance of the research, which may include references to datasets.

In the **experimental methodology section**, I will look for detailed descriptions of the datasets used for training and evaluation. This section typically contains the most comprehensive information about the datasets, including their names, sizes, and any relevant characteristics.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **results section** to confirm that the datasets mentioned were indeed used in the experiments and to gather any additional context or findings related to them.

Finally, I will consult the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

Based on my reading, I will compile the following datasets:

1. **C4 Dataset**: This dataset is mentioned in the experimental setup, where the authors state that they used C4 for training data. I will look for the full citation in the references.

2. **Penn Action Dataset**: If mentioned, I will ensure to find its citation as well.

3. **JHMDB Dataset**: Similarly, if referenced, I will locate its citation.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will document each dataset with its name, description, and full citation. This will ensure that the datasets are accurately represented and properly credited in any subsequent analysis or use.
