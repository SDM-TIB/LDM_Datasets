To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Sparse multi-view hand-object reconstruction for unseen environments" by Yik Lung Pang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors trained their model on a synthetic dataset and evaluated it on a real-world dataset, which suggests that there are at least two datasets involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used. In **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, they provide details about the datasets:

1. **ObMan**: This is a synthetic dataset used for training the model. It contains 8 object categories derived from ShapeNet, with a total of 87,190 samples for training and 6,285 samples for testing. The authors mention that they discard samples with too many double-sided triangles.

2. **DexYCB**: This dataset is used for testing and includes multi-view video recordings of humans grasping objects. It contains 20 unique objects from the YCB-Video dataset, with a total of 2,000 sampled frames and 16,000 images.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **ObMan**, the citation is:
  > Yana Hasson, Gul Varol, Dimitrios Tzionas, Igor Kalevatykh, Michael J. Black, Ivan Laptev, and Cordelia Schmid. *Learning joint reconstruction of hands and manipulated objects*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 11807–11816, 2019.

- For **DexYCB**, the citation is:
  > Yu-Wei Chao, Wei Yang, Yu Xiang, Pavlo Molchanov, Ankur Handa, Jonathan Tremblay, Yashraj S Narang, Karl Van Wyk, Umar Iqbal, Stan Birchfield, et al. *DexYCB: A benchmark for capturing hand grasping of objects*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 9044–9053, 2021.

With this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
