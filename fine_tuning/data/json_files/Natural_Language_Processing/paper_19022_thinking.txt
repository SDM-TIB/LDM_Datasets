To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Topology-Aware Uncertainty for Image Segmentation" by Saumya Gupta et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the method is evaluated on various datasets, which indicates that there are datasets to be identified.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically looking for a subsection that discusses the datasets used. In this paper, the authors mention four datasets: **DRIVE**, **ROSE**, **ROADS**, and **PARSE 2022 Grand Challenge**. I will extract details about each dataset, including their characteristics and any specific splits mentioned.

1. **DRIVE Dataset**: This dataset is a 2D retinal vessel dataset consisting of 40 images, each with a resolution of 584 × 565. The authors use a predetermined split of 20 training images and 20 test images.

2. **ROSE Dataset**: The ROSE dataset is a 2D retinal OCTA segmentation dataset, specifically using ROSE-1 (SVC). It contains 39 samples, with a split of 30 training and 9 test samples, each having a resolution of 304 × 304.

3. **ROADS Dataset**: This is a large non-medical dataset containing 1171 aerial images, with a resolution of 1500 × 1500. The dataset is split into 1108 training, 14 validation, and 49 test images.

4. **PARSE Dataset**: The PARSE dataset consists of 3D CT scans of pulmonary arteries, containing 100 volumes with sizes varying from 512 × 512 × 228 to 512 × 512 × 376. The authors use 4-fold cross-validation for evaluation.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. However, the paper does not provide explicit citations for these datasets, so I will summarize the information based on the descriptions provided in the text.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with the necessary details, ensuring to include the full citations for any referenced works related to the datasets, if available.

In summary, the datasets extracted from the paper are:

- **DRIVE Dataset**:

- **ROSE Dataset**: 
  > Ma, Y., Hao, H., Xie, J., Fu, H., Zhang, J., Yang, J., Wang, Z., Liu, J., Zheng, Y., & Zhao, Y. (2020). ROSE: A retinal OCT-angiography vessel segmentation dataset and new model. *IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging*, 39(9), 2740-2751.

- **ROADS Dataset**:

- **PARSE Dataset**: 
  > Luo, G., Wang, K., Liu, J., Li, S., Liang, X., Li, X., Gan, S., Wang, W., Dong, S., & Wang, W. (2023). Efficient automatic segmentation for multi-level pulmonary arteries: The PARSE challenge. *arXiv preprint arXiv:2304.03708*.

With this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for further processing or review.
