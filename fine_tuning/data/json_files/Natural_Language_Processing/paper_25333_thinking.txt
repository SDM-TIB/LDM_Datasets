To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CIC-BART-SSA: Controllable Image Captioning with Structured Semantic Augmentation" by Kalliopi Basioti et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental results sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the use of **Flickr30k Entities (Flickr-Ent)** and **MS-COCO Entities (COCO-Ent)**, indicating that these are the primary datasets utilized in the research.

Next, I will look for detailed descriptions of these datasets in the **experimental setup section**. Here, the authors specify that **Flickr-Ent** augments the original Flickr30k dataset with region-phrase correspondences, containing 31,000 images with five captions each. The **COCO-Ent** dataset is similarly described as augmenting the original MS-COCO dataset, which consists of 120,000 images, each annotated with around five captions.

In the **results section**, the authors evaluate their model's performance on both datasets, confirming their significance in the experiments. This reinforces the importance of these datasets in the context of the research.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the **References section** of the paper:

1. For **Flickr30k Entities**, the citation is:
   > Plummer, B.A., Wang, L., Cervantes, C.M., Caicedo, J.C., Hockenmaier, J., Lazebnik, S. *Flickr30k entities: Collecting region-to-phrase correspondences for richer image-to-sentence models*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 2641–2649, 2015.

2. For **MS-COCO**, the citation is:
   > Lin, T.Y., Maire, M., Belongie, S., Hays, J., Perona, P., Ramanan, D., Dollár, P., Zitnick, C.L. *Microsoft coco: Common objects in context*. In Computer Vision–ECCV 2014: 13th European Conference, Zurich, Switzerland, September 6-12, 2014, Proceedings, Part V, pages 740–755, 2014.

After compiling this information, I will summarize the datasets in a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly identified along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, which is crucial for reproducibility and further studies in the field.
