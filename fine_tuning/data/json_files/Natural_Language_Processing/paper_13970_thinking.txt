To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Experiential-Informed Data Reconstruction for Fishery Sustainability and Policies in the Azores" by Brenda Nogueira et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract highlights the use of a unique dataset from the Azoresâ€™ fishing data collection programs between 2010 and 2017, indicating that this dataset is central to the research.

Next, I will focus on **section III (Fisheries Data)**, where the authors provide a detailed overview of the datasets used in their study. They mention two specific datasets:

1. **LOTAC/OKEANOS-UAc daily landings dataset**: This dataset is collected from various fishing harbors in the Azores and includes information about fishing activities, such as fishing gears used and the characteristics of the landings. The authors state that this dataset covers the period from 2010 to 2017 and contains 33,895 samples.

2. **PNRD/OKEANOS-UAc inquiries database**: This database is used to gather information during the fishery landings process, focusing on fishing gears, fishing effort, and other relevant characteristics. It complements the LOTAC dataset and is crucial for the study's analysis.

In the **acknowledgments section**, the authors mention the LOTAC/OKEANOS-UAc fishing landings database, which further confirms its significance in their research.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to retrieve full citations for these datasets. However, the paper does not provide specific citations for the datasets themselves, as they are likely internal databases managed by the authors' institutions. Therefore, I will note that the datasets are associated with the following entities:

- **LOTAC/OKEANOS-UAc daily landings dataset**: Managed by LOTAC, S.A., a regional public company responsible for fish auctions and fisheries landings statistics in the Azores.

- **PNRD/OKEANOS-UAc inquiries database**: Managed by OKEANOS, which is involved in the collection and management of fisheries data in the Azores.

Since the datasets do not have formal citations like published papers, I will document them as follows:

1. **LOTAC/OKEANOS-UAc daily landings dataset**: 
   > LOTAC, S.A. *LOTAC/OKEANOS-UAc daily landings dataset*. Azores, Portugal, 2010-2017.

2. **PNRD/OKEANOS-UAc inquiries database**: 
   > OKEANOS. *PNRD/OKEANOS-UAc inquiries database*. Azores, Portugal, 2010-2017.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for clarity and future reference. This will ensure that the datasets are properly documented and can be easily accessed for further analysis or validation.
