To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Pre-trained Language Model based Ranking in Baidu Search" by Lixin Zou et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for evaluation. In this case, the authors discuss the use of user behavioral data and manually labeled data, which indicates that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for training and evaluation. In this paper, they mention two types of data:

1. **Logged User Behavioral Data**: This dataset consists of three months of user access logs, including 538,314,000 queries and 2,986,664,000 query-document pairs. This dataset is crucial for the relevance-oriented pre-training stage.

2. **Manually Labeled Data**: This dataset is used for fine-tuning and consists of 9,697,087 training pairs, 160,999 evaluation pairs, and 279,128 test pairs. This dataset is essential for assessing the model's performance.

I will then check the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. However, in this case, the datasets are derived from internal data collection and do not have external citations. Therefore, I will note that the datasets are proprietary to Baidu and do not have publicly available citations.

Finally, I will summarize the datasets identified:

- **Logged User Behavioral Data**: Contains 538,314,000 queries and 2,986,664,000 query-document pairs, used for pre-training.
- **Manually Labeled Data**: Comprises 9,697,087 training pairs, 160,999 evaluation pairs, and 279,128 test pairs, used for fine-tuning.

Since these datasets do not have formal citations, I will indicate that they are proprietary datasets from Baidu.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for clarity and future reference.
