To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Adaptive Neural Ranking Framework: Toward Maximized Business Goal for Cascade Ranking Systems" by Zhiqiang Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on **four public and industrial benchmarks**, which indicates that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section (Section 5)**, where the authors provide details about the datasets used. They specifically mention two datasets constructed from the Kuaishou advertising system and two publicly available datasets. I will look for the names and descriptions of these datasets.

In **Section 5.1 (Experiment Setup)**, the authors describe the datasets as follows:

1. **Industry Easy Dataset (industryeasydataset)**: This dataset is collected from the Kuaishou advertising system, with a training size of 3 billion impressions and a test size of 600 million impressions. The dataset includes a range of materials per impression and labels.

2. **Industry Hard Dataset (industryharddataset)**: Another dataset from the Kuaishou advertising system, with a training size of 6 billion impressions and a test size of 1.2 billion impressions. Similar to the previous dataset, it has a range of materials per impression and labels.

3. **MSLR-WEB30K Dataset**: A publicly available dataset with a training size of 8 million impressions and a test size of 2 million impressions. It is commonly used in learning-to-rank tasks.

4. **Istella Dataset**: Another public dataset with a training size of 5.6 million impressions and a test size of 1.4 million impressions. This dataset is also used for learning-to-rank tasks.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

- For the **MSLR-WEB30K Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Qin, T., & Liu, T. Y. (2013). Introducing LETOR 4.0 Datasets. CoRR, abs/1306.2597.

- For the **Istella Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Dato, D., Lucchese, C., Nardini, F. M., Orlando, S., Perego, R., Tonellotto, N., & Venturini, R. (2016). Fast Ranking with Additive Ensembles of Oblivious and Non-Oblivious Regression Trees. ACM Transactions on Information Systems, 15(1), 15:1â€“15:31.

The industrial datasets do not have specific citations as they are proprietary to Kuaishou Technology.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations. This will ensure that all relevant information is captured accurately for future reference or processing.
