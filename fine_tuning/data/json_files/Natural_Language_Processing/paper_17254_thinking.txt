To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Explaining Reinforcement Learning Agents Through Counterfactual Action Outcomes" by Yotam Amitai et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study but may not mention specific datasets. The introduction may provide context or references to datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, as this is where the authors typically describe the experimental setup, including any datasets used for training or evaluation. I will look for any mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

In this paper, the authors describe the **Highway Environment** as the setting for their experiments. However, they do not explicitly mention a dataset in the traditional sense (like a collection of labeled data). Instead, they refer to the environment in which the reinforcement learning agents operate. I will note this as it is relevant to the context of the experiments.

I will also check the **references section** to see if any external datasets are cited that may have been used in the experiments. If the authors refer to any established datasets or environments, I will extract their full citations.

Upon reviewing the references, I find that the authors cite two repositories related to the Highway environment and reinforcement learning algorithms:

1. **Highway Environment**:
   > Leurent, E. (2018). *An Environment for Autonomous Driving Decision-Making*. Available at: https://github.com/eleurent/highway-env

2. **RL Agents**:
   > Leurent, E. (2018). *rl-agents: Implementations of reinforcement learning algorithms*. Available at: https://github.com/eleurent/rl-agents

While these are not traditional datasets, they provide the necessary context for the experiments conducted in the paper.

Now, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citations for the resources mentioned. This will allow for proper attribution and reference in any future work or analysis.
