To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Metric Learning-based Imbalanced Classification for Diagnosing Threaded Pipe Connection Defects using Functional Data" by Yukun Xie et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and evaluation sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on diagnosing defects using functional data, which suggests that datasets related to threaded pipe connections may be involved.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any explicit mentions of datasets. The authors discuss the challenges of imbalanced classification and the need for a dataset that reflects the manufacturing process of threaded pipe connections. They mention a real-world case study, which indicates that a specific dataset is likely used.

In the **evaluation section**, the authors describe the dataset used for their experiments. They mention that they applied their framework to a dataset derived from the manufacturing of threaded pipe connections, consisting of 658 samples, including normal connections and two types of nonconforming connections. This section provides crucial details about the dataset's composition and its relevance to the study.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. The paper references several works that may include datasets or methodologies relevant to the study. However, the primary dataset appears to be the one collected from the manufacturing process, which is not attributed to a specific external source but is described in detail.

The dataset can be summarized as follows:
- **Threaded Pipe Connection Dataset**: This dataset consists of 658 samples, including 599 normal connections, 28 samples for one defect type, and 31 samples for another defect type. It contains multichannel functional data with varying-length observations during the thread engagement phase of the manufacturing process.

Since the dataset is derived from a real-world case study and does not have a formal citation like other datasets, I will note that it is based on the authors' own data collection efforts.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format for clarity and future reference. The focus will be on ensuring that the dataset description is comprehensive and accurately reflects the content of the paper.
