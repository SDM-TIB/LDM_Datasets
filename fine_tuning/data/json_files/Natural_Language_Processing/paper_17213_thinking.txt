To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Few-Shot Learning from Augmented Label-Uncertain Queries in Bongard-HOI" by Qinqian Lei et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract highlights the use of the **Bongard-HOI benchmark** as the primary dataset for evaluating the proposed method, which is a strong indication that this dataset is crucial for the research.

Next, I will examine the **introduction section** where the authors discuss the Bongard-HOI benchmark in detail. They mention that it serves as a few-shot HOI benchmark and describe its structure, which includes positive and negative support images. This confirms that the Bongard-HOI dataset is central to their experiments.

In the **experimental results section**, the authors provide specific performance metrics achieved on the Bongard-HOI benchmark, reinforcing its significance in their research. They also mention the **HICO-FS dataset** as another dataset used for evaluation, which is important to note.

Now, I will look at the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. **Bongard-HOI**: The citation is:
   > Jiang, H., Ma, X., Nie, W., Yu, Z., Zhu, Y., & Anandkumar, A. (2022). Bongard-HOI: Benchmarking Few-Shot Visual Reasoning for Human-Object Interactions. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 19056–19065.

2. **HICO-FS**: The citation is:
   > Ji, Z., Liu, X., Pang, Y., & Li, X. (2020). SGAP-Net: Semantic-guided attentive prototypes network for few-shot human-object interaction recognition. In Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, volume 34, 11085–11092.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets:

- **Bongard-HOI**: A benchmark dataset for few-shot human-object interaction detection, consisting of instances with positive and negative support images.
- **HICO-FS**: A dataset for few-shot human-object interaction recognition, providing a more general context for evaluating few-shot learning methods.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that each dataset is clearly identified along with its full citation.
