To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Image Fusion via Vision-Language Model" by Zixiang Zhao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information and provide full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors propose a new paradigm for image fusion and mention a vision-language dataset, which suggests that datasets are indeed involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Vision-Language Fusion Datasets)**, where the authors detail the datasets they have created or utilized. Here, they introduce the **Vision-Language Fusion (VLF) dataset**, which includes paired paragraph descriptions generated by ChatGPT for eight image fusion datasets across four tasks. This section is crucial as it provides specific details about the datasets.

The authors mention the following datasets used for image fusion tasks:

1. **MSRS Infrared-Visible Fusion Dataset**: This dataset is used for infrared-visible image fusion tasks and consists of 1083 image pairs for training and 361 pairs for testing.

2. **M3FD Infrared-Visible Fusion Dataset**: Another dataset for infrared-visible fusion, which is referenced in the context of evaluating the proposed method.

3. **RoadScene Infrared-Visible Fusion Dataset**: This dataset is also used for infrared-visible fusion tasks, further confirming the datasets utilized in their experiments.

4. **Harvard Medical Image Fusion Dataset**: This dataset is used for medical image fusion tasks and consists of 50 pairs of MRI-CT, MRI-PET, and MRI-SPECT images.

5. **SICE Multi-exposure Image Fusion Dataset**: This dataset is used for multi-exposure image fusion tasks, with 499 pairs for training and additional pairs for testing.

6. **MEFB Multi-exposure Image Fusion Dataset**: Another dataset for multi-exposure image fusion, which complements the SICE dataset.

7. **RealMFF Multi-focus Image Fusion Dataset**: This dataset is used for multi-focus image fusion tasks and consists of 639 image pairs for training.

8. **Lytro Multi-focus Image Fusion Dataset**: This dataset is also used for multi-focus image fusion, providing additional data for evaluation.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to gather full citations for each dataset mentioned. The citations are as follows:

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information and citations, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing.
