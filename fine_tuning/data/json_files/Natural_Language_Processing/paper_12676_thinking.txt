To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Efficient Multi-Change Point Analysis to Decode Economic Crisis Information from the S&P500 Mean Market Correlation" by Martin He√üler et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study focuses on the S&P500 mean market correlation over a period of roughly 20 years, which suggests that the dataset used is related to stock market data.

Next, I will examine **section 2 (Data and Methods)**, particularly subsection 2.1 (Data Preparation), where the authors describe the data gathering process. They mention using daily stock data from the 500 companies included in the S&P500 index, filtered for companies that were included for at least 99.5% of the time between January 1, 1992, and December 28, 2012. This gives me the first dataset:

1. **S&P500 Daily Stock Data**: This dataset consists of daily stock prices for 249 companies over 5291 trading days, used to compute pairwise correlations and analyze market trends.

In the same section, the authors also mention the use of the **antiCPy** package for change point analysis, which is an implementation detail rather than a dataset but is important for understanding the methodology.

Next, I will check the **results section** to see if any specific datasets are referenced in relation to the findings. The authors discuss the mean market correlation and its relation to economic crises, but they do not introduce new datasets here; they rely on the previously mentioned S&P500 data.

Finally, I will look at the **References section** to find citations for the datasets or methodologies used. However, since the S&P500 dataset is a well-known financial dataset, it may not have a specific citation in the references.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring to include the full citation for the dataset:

- For the **S&P500 Daily Stock Data**, while there is no specific citation provided in the paper, I will note that it is commonly accessed through financial data providers or platforms like Yahoo Finance, as mentioned in the paper.

In summary, the key dataset extracted from the paper is the S&P500 Daily Stock Data, which is crucial for the analysis presented in the research. I will ensure to document this dataset appropriately in the final output.
