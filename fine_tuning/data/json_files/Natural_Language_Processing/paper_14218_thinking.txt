To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Autonomous Vehicles: an overview on system, cyber security, risks, issues, and a way forward" by Md Aminul Islam and Sarah Alqhtani, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and relevant sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The introduction provides context about autonomous vehicles and their development, but I need to look for specific datasets used in the research.

Next, I will examine **section 4 (Traffic Flow prediction in Autonomous vehicles)** and **section 6 (Cybersecurity Risks)**, as these sections may contain references to datasets used for traffic prediction models or cybersecurity analysis. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, descriptions, and any relevant details about their structure or content.

If the paper discusses specific datasets, I will note their names and any associated details provided by the authors. For example, if they mention datasets used for training machine learning models or datasets for traffic flow analysis, I will extract that information.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. I will ensure to capture the authors, title, publication details, and any relevant DOI or URL links.

If the paper does not explicitly mention datasets, I will look for any supplementary materials or appendices that might contain this information.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation, ready for structured output or further processing.
