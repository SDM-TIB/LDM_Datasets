To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The Research of Group Re-identification from Multiple Cameras" by Hao Xiao, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the importance of group re-identification and hints at the use of various datasets for experiments. This suggests that there may be specific datasets referenced later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets explicitly mentioned. In the experimental results section, the author discusses three datasets used for evaluation:

1. **MCTS Dataset**: This dataset is described as being captured at an airport arrival hall under a multi-camera CCTV network, containing 64 groups and 274 group images. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Zheng, W.-S., Gong, S., & Xiang, T. (2009). *Associating groups of people*. In Proceedings of the British Machine Vision Conference (BMVC).

2. **DukeMTMC Dataset**: This dataset is noted for its high resolution and includes surveillance footage from 8 cameras, with approximately 85 minutes of video for each camera. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Ristani, E., Solera, F., Zou, R., Cucchiara, R., & Tomasi, C. (2016). *Performance measures and a data set for multi-target, multi-camera tracking*. In European Conference on Computer Vision workshop on Benchmarking Multi-Target Tracking.

3. **Road Dataset**: This is a newly constructed dataset that includes 162 group pairs taken by two cameras monitoring different regions. Since this dataset is original to the authors, I will note that it does not have a formal citation but will describe it as follows:
   > Road Dataset: A custom dataset constructed by the authors, consisting of 162 group pairs captured in a realistic crowd road scene.

After identifying these datasets, I will ensure that I have the full citations for the datasets that are referenced in the paper. 

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and citation for each dataset. This will ensure that I have a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
