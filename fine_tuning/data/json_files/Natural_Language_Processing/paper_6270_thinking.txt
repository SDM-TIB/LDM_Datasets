To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Explainable Artificial Intelligence for Exhaust Gas Temperature of Turbofan Engines" by Marios Kefalas et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention the type of data used, while the introduction often contextualizes the research and may reference specific datasets.

Next, I will focus on **section IV (Experimental Setup and Results)**, as this section typically contains detailed information about the datasets used in the experiments. Here, the authors describe the **continuous engine operational data (CEOD)** collected from a GEnx turbofan engine mounted on a Boeing 787, recorded during four flights in July 2019. This is a clear indication of a dataset being utilized.

I will note the specifics of the CEOD dataset:
- It consists of several hundred parameters (696) measured at a frequency of 1Hz throughout the entire flight duration.
- The dataset is proprietary and cannot be shared publicly, which is an important detail to include.

Additionally, I will check the **References section** for any citations related to the datasets. However, since the CEOD is proprietary and not publicly available, there may not be a formal citation for it. Instead, I will document the context in which it is used.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring to include the full citation for the paper itself, as it is crucial for proper attribution.

The citation for the paper is:

Finally, I will summarize the dataset information in a clear and concise manner, ready for further processing or review.
