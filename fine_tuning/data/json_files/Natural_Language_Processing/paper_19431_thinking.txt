To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A hierarchical decomposition for explaining ML performance discrepancies" by Jean Feng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's objectives and may mention datasets used for experiments or analysis.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their analyses. This section often contains detailed information about the datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

In this paper, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the following sections:

1. **Introduction**: This section may provide context about the datasets used, especially if they are well-known benchmarks or widely used in the field.
2. **Methods**: Here, the authors might describe the datasets in detail, including how they were collected, any preprocessing steps, and their relevance to the study.
3. **Results**: This section may also reference datasets, particularly when discussing findings related to specific data.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, if the paper mentions datasets like "Hospital Readmission Dataset" or "American Community Survey (ACS) Data," I will look for their full citations in the references. If the datasets are from other studies, I will ensure to cite the original papers.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset information in a structured format for easy reference and further analysis.
