To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Hybrid metapopulation agent-based epidemiological models for efficient insight on the individual scale: a contribution to green computing" by Julia Bicker et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or data sources.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to see if the authors reference any specific datasets that were used in their research. This section often contains background information and may mention datasets that are foundational to the study.

In the **methods section**, I will look for a subsection that discusses the datasets in detail. This is typically where authors describe the data collection process, the specific datasets used, and any relevant characteristics of those datasets. If the paper includes a section specifically titled "Datasets" or "Data Sources," I will pay close attention to that.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **results section** to see how the datasets were utilized in the analysis and any findings related to them. This will help confirm the relevance and application of the datasets mentioned.

Finally, I will consult the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. It is crucial to provide accurate citations for datasets, as they are essential for reproducibility and further research.

Based on the information gathered, I will compile a list of datasets, including their names, descriptions, and full citations. This will ensure that I have a comprehensive understanding of the datasets used in the study and can present them clearly.

Once I have all the necessary information, I will format the dataset entries according to the required structure, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its citation.
