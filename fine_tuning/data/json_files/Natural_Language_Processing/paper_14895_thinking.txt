To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Evading Community Detection via Counterfactual Neighborhood Search" by Andrea Bernini et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors validate their approach on five real-world datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed present in the paper. I will take note of this and look for specific names and details in the subsequent sections.

Next, I will examine **section 6 (Experiments)**, where the authors provide details about the datasets used for training and evaluation. In this section, they explicitly list the datasets:

1. **words**: This dataset is described as having a favorable balance regarding the number of nodes, edges, and discovered communities.
2. **kar**: Another dataset mentioned, but specific details are not provided in this section.
3. **Wikipedia’s vote**: This dataset is also referenced, but again, specific details are not provided.
4. **pow**: This dataset is mentioned without detailed description.
5. **Facebook fb-75**: This dataset is noted for having thousands of nodes and hundreds of thousands of edges.

The authors also provide a table (Table 1) summarizing the properties of these datasets, including the number of nodes and edges, as well as the number of communities detected by different algorithms.

To ensure I have the full citations for these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper. However, it appears that the datasets themselves may not have dedicated citations in the references, as they are commonly used datasets in the field. Therefore, I will note the datasets as they are presented in the paper without external citations.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries based on the information gathered:

1. **words**: A dataset used for training the DRL agent, characterized by a balanced number of nodes and edges.
2. **kar**: A dataset mentioned in the experiments, specific details not provided.
3. **Wikipedia’s vote**: A dataset referenced in the experiments, specific details not provided.
4. **pow**: A dataset mentioned in the experiments, specific details not provided.
5. **Facebook fb-75**: A dataset noted for its large size, with thousands of nodes and hundreds of thousands of edges.

Since the datasets are commonly used in the community detection literature, I will not provide external citations but will document them as they are referenced in the paper.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for review or downstream processing, ensuring that I have accurately captured the relevant details from the paper.
