To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On the Effectiveness of Adversarial Samples against Ensemble Learning-based Windows PE Malware Detectors" by Trong-Nghia To et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on malware detection and may hint at the datasets used.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any references to datasets. The authors may discuss the datasets used for training and testing their models, which is crucial for understanding the context of their experiments.

In the **methodology section**, particularly under the **Data Collection** subsection, the authors provide detailed information about the datasets used. Here, they mention that their dataset consists of **115,000 PE files**, which includes **55,000 benign files** collected from a Windows 7 virtual machine and **60,000 malware files** sourced from VirusTotal. This section is critical as it outlines the composition of the dataset.

I will also look for any **tables or figures** that summarize the datasets or their characteristics. For instance, **Table IV** provides an overview of data distribution, which is essential for understanding how the dataset is utilized in different components of the study.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The authors reference VirusTotal, which is a well-known dataset for malware analysis. I will ensure to include the citation for VirusTotal as follows:

- For **VirusTotal**, the citation is:
  > VirusTotal. "VirusTotal: Free Online Virus, Malware and URL Scanner." [Online]. Available: https://www.virustotal.com/

Additionally, I will note that the authors collected benign files from a Windows 7 virtual machine, but they do not provide a specific citation for this dataset. Therefore, I will mention it as a self-collected dataset.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations and descriptions as required.

1. **Dataset Name**: PE Malware Dataset
   - **Description**: A dataset consisting of 115,000 PE files, including 55,000 benign files collected from a Windows 7 virtual machine and 60,000 malware files from VirusTotal.
   - **Citation**: VirusTotal. "VirusTotal: Free Online Virus, Malware and URL Scanner." [Online]. Available: https://www.virustotal.com/

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for further processing or review.
