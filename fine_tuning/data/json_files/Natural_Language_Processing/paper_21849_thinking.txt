To extract datasets from the research paper titled "3DFlowRenderer: One-shot Face Re-enactment via Dense 3D Facial Flow Estimation" by Siddharth Nijhawan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and evaluation sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of a novel warping technology for face re-enactment, which suggests that datasets may be involved, particularly for training and evaluation purposes.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of one-shot facial re-enactment and the need for robust datasets. They hint at the use of existing datasets but do not specify them yet.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly where the authors describe their training process. Here, they mention using the **VoxCeleb dataset** for training their model. This dataset is crucial as it contains talking-head video sequences extracted from publicly available YouTube videos, which aligns with their research focus.

In the **evaluation section**, the authors reiterate their use of the VoxCeleb dataset for both training and evaluation, confirming its significance in their experiments.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citation for the VoxCeleb dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:
> Nagrani, A., Chung, J.S., Zisserman, A. (2017). VoxCeleb: A Large-Scale Speaker Identification Dataset. In Proc. Interspeech 2017. pp. 2616â€“2620. https://doi.org/10.21437/Interspeech.2017-950

Having identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the findings:

1. **VoxCeleb Dataset**: This dataset is used for training and evaluation in the context of one-shot face re-enactment. It contains a large number of talking-head video sequences.

Now, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
