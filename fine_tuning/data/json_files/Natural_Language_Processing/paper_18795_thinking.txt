To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Source Identification in Abstractive Summarization" by Yoshi Suhara and Dimitris Alikaniotis, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of the **CNN/DailyMail** and **XSum** datasets for annotating source sentences, which indicates that these datasets are crucial for the research.

Next, I will look into **section 2 (SourceSum)**, where the authors explicitly state that they used the **XSum** and **CNN/DailyMail** datasets. They describe these datasets as popular summarization benchmarks, which further confirms their significance in the study.

In **section 2.1 (Corpus creation)**, the authors provide details about how they sampled document-summary pairs from these datasets. This section reinforces the importance of both datasets in their methodology.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The citations are essential for proper attribution and to guide readers who may want to access the datasets.

For the **XSum dataset**, the citation is:
> Shashi Narayan, Shay B. Cohen, and Mirella Lapata. *Don’t give me the details, just the summary! topic-aware convolutional neural networks for extreme summarization*. In Proceedings of the 2018 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 1797–1807, Brussels, Belgium. Association for Computational Linguistics.

For the **CNN/DailyMail dataset**, the citation is:
> Abigail See, Peter J. Liu, and Christopher D. Manning. *Get to the point: Summarization with pointer-generator networks*. In Proceedings of the 55th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers), pages 1073–1083, Vancouver, Canada. Association for Computational Linguistics.

Having gathered the necessary information, I will now prepare to compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will involve summarizing the key characteristics of each dataset and including the full citations as part of the dataset descriptions.
