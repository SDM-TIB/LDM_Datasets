To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Interpretable Physical-Conceptual Catchment-Scale Hydrological Modeling using the Mass-Conserving-Perceptron" by Yuan-Heng Wang and Hoshin V. Gupta, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's goals and methods, which may include references to datasets used for model training or evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental setup section** (Section 4), where the authors typically describe the datasets used in their experiments. In this section, I will look for specific mentions of datasets, including their names, characteristics, and any relevant details about how they were used in the study.

In this paper, the authors mention the **Leaf River dataset** in Section 4.1, which consists of 40 years of daily data from the Leaf River Basin in Mississippi, USA. This dataset includes cumulative daily values of observed mean areal precipitation, potential evapotranspiration, and watershed outlet streamflow. I will note the specifics of this dataset, including its temporal coverage and the types of data it contains.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. For the Leaf River dataset, I will look for the original source or any relevant publications that describe the dataset in detail.

The citation for the Leaf River dataset is:
> U.S. National Weather Service. *Leaf River Basin Daily Data (1949-1988)*. Available from: [insert URL or DOI if available].

Finally, I will compile the extracted information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described with its full citation. This will include the dataset name, a brief description, and the citation, which is crucial for proper attribution and further reference.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets used in the research paper.
