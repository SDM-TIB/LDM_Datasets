To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Criterion Collapse and Loss Distribution Control" by Matthew J. Holland, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and empirical analysis sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the work, which may include mentions of datasets used for experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **empirical analysis section** (section 4), as this is where the author is likely to describe the datasets used in the experiments. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, characteristics, and any relevant details about how they were used in the research.

In the empirical analysis, the author mentions using **four standard datasets**: **CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, FashionMNIST, and SVHN**. I will note down the details provided about each dataset, including their purpose in the experiments and any specific configurations mentioned.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research. I will look for any papers or sources that describe these datasets in detail.

The full citations I will extract for each dataset are as follows:

1. **CIFAR-10**:
   > Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. *CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets*. 2009. [Link to dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html).

2. **CIFAR-100**:
   > Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. *CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets*. 2009. [Link to dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html).

3. **FashionMNIST**:
   > Zalando Research. *Fashion-MNIST: a Novel Image Dataset for Benchmarking Machine Learning Algorithms*. 2017. [Link to dataset](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist).

4. **SVHN**:
   > Yuval Netzer, Tao Wang, Adam Coates, Alessandro Bissacco, Bo Wu, and Andrew Y. Ng. *Reading Digits in Natural Images with Unsupervised Feature Learning*. 2011. [Link to dataset](http://ufldl.stanford.edu/housenumbers/).

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details and that the citations are correctly formatted for future reference.
