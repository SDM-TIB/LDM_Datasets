To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Transformer-Based Model for the Prediction of Human Gaze Behavior on Videos" by Yao Rong et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors employed an eye-tracking dataset gathered from videos generated by the VirtualHome simulator, which suggests that this dataset is crucial for their research.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically **section 4.1 (Dataset)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset used for their experiments. Here, they describe the dataset as primarily collected for gaze-based action recognition and activity prediction tasks, including videos from the VirtualHome simulator. They mention that the dataset consists of 185 distinct videos for 18 different activities, recorded from multiple static cameras, which is essential for understanding the dataset's structure and purpose.

The authors also provide specifics about the eye movement data collection process, including the use of a Tobii Spectrum Eye Tracker and the number of participants involved. This information is vital for understanding the dataset's context and application.

Now, I will look for the **full citation** of the dataset mentioned in the paper. The authors reference the VirtualHome dataset, which is detailed in the following citation:

- For the **VirtualHome dataset**, the citation is:
  > Xavier Puig, Kevin Ra, Marko Boben, Jiaman Li, Tingwu Wang, Sanja Fidler, and Antonio Torralba. *Virtualhome: Simulating household activities via programs*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 8494â€“8502, 2018.

Additionally, the authors reference their own work regarding the gaze-guided action anticipation model, which is also relevant for understanding the dataset's application in their experiments. The citation for this work is:

- For the **Gaze-Guided Graph Neural Network**, the citation is:
  > Suleyman Ozdel, Yao Rong, Berat Mert Albaba, Yen-Ling Kuo, Xi Wang, and Enkelejda Kasneci. *Gaze-Guided Graph Neural Network for Action Anticipation Conditioned on Intention*. In 2024 Symposium on Eye Tracking Research and Applications, to appear. https://doi.org/10.1145/3649902.3653340

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research, ready for further processing or review.
