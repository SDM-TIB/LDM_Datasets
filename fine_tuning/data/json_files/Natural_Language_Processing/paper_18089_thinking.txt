To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Uncertainty-Aware Hardware Trojan Detection Using Multimodal Deep Learning" by Rahul Vishwakarma and Amin Rezaei, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will look for any references to datasets used for training or evaluation.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of acquiring large and diverse datasets for hardware Trojan detection, which indicates that datasets are crucial to their work. I will pay attention to any specific datasets mentioned.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental results section**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention using features extracted from the **TrustHub RTL-level (Verilog) Trojan dataset** and a graph dataset referenced in another paper. This is a clear indication that these datasets are central to their research.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **TrustHub RTL-level (Verilog) Trojan dataset**, the citation is:
   > H. Salmani, M. Tehranipoor, S. Sutikno, and F. Wijitrisnanto. *Trust-hub trojan benchmark for hardware trojan detection model creation using machine learning*. 2022. Available: https://dx.doi.org/10.21227/px6s-sm21.

2. For the **graph dataset**, the citation is:
   > S.-Y. Yu, R. Yasaei, Q. Zhou, T. Nguyen, and M. A. A. Faruque. *Hw2vec: A graph learning tool for automating hardware security*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2107.12328, 2021. Available: https://dx.doi.org/10.21227/j1vv-hw18.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

- **TrustHub RTL-level (Verilog) Trojan dataset**: This dataset is based on code branching features and is used for creating models for hardware Trojan detection.
- **Graph dataset**: This dataset includes RTL source code files (Verilog) for each IP core design, containing both malicious and non-malicious functions.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its full citation.
