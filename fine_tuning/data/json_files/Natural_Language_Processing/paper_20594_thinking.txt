To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Sequential Modeling of Complex Marine Navigation: Case Study on a Passenger Vessel" by Yimeng Fan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the use of a "real-world dataset spanning two years of a ferry in west coast Canada," which indicates that there is a dataset involved. I will note this down as a potential dataset.

Next, I will look for specific sections that discuss datasets in detail. The **environment** section mentions the construction of a "RL compatible dataset" and describes its structure, which includes observations, actions, rewards, and termination indicators. This suggests that there is a well-defined dataset used for reinforcement learning.

I will also check the **modeling** and **preprocessing** sections for any additional datasets or details about the dataset used. The authors describe the operational dataset measured on the ferry every minute over a two-year period, capturing various sensor data. This dataset is crucial for their analysis and modeling.

Now, I will compile the information I have gathered about the datasets:

1. **Operational Dataset**: This dataset consists of sensor data collected from a ferry operating on the west coast of Canada over two years, capturing various metrics such as fuel consumption, speed, and location. This dataset is essential for the time series forecasting model discussed in the paper.

2. **Reinforcement Learning Dataset**: This dataset is structured for use in a Gym environment and includes trip dictionaries with keys for observations, next observations, actions, rewards, and termination. It is designed to facilitate reinforcement learning experiments.

Next, I will refer to the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper cites several works that may provide context or foundational data, but it does not provide specific citations for the datasets themselves. Therefore, I will summarize the datasets based on the information provided in the paper without external citations.

Finally, I will ensure that I have clearly documented the datasets, including their descriptions and any relevant details, so that they can be easily referenced or utilized in future work.

In summary, I will extract the following datasets:

- **Operational Dataset**: A dataset capturing sensor data from a ferry over two years, used for time series forecasting.
- **Reinforcement Learning Dataset**: A structured dataset for reinforcement learning experiments, including observations, actions, and rewards.

I will now prepare to format this information according to the required structure for downstream processing.
