To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DCS-Net: Pioneering Leakage-Free Point Cloud Pretraining Framework with Global Insights" by Zhe Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of a pretraining dataset, which indicates that there may be specific datasets referenced later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Pretraining Dataset and Implementation)**, where the authors explicitly mention the dataset used for pretraining. They state that they employed the **ShapeNet** dataset, which is described as encompassing over 50,000 unique 3D models spanning 55 common object categories. This is a clear identification of a dataset.

I will also check the **downstream tasks section (4.2)**, where the authors mention two additional datasets used for evaluation:

1. **ScanObjectNN Dataset**: This dataset is noted to comprise approximately 15,000 objects extracted from real indoor scans, covering 2902 point clouds from 15 categories.

2. **ModelNet40 Dataset**: This dataset consists of 12,311 clean 3D CAD models spanning 40 categories.

Next, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **ShapeNet**, the citation is:
  > Chang, A. X., Funkhouser, T., Guibas, L., Hanrahan, P., Huang, Q., Li, Z., Savarese, S., Savva, M., Song, S., Su, H., et al. *ShapeNet: An information-rich 3D model repository*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1512.03012, 2015.

- For **ScanObjectNN**, the citation is:
  > Uy, M. A., Pham, Q.-H., Hua, B.-S., Nguyen, T., and Yeung, S.-K. *Revisiting point cloud classification: A new benchmark dataset and classification model on real-world data*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision, pp. 1588–1597, 2019.

- For **ModelNet40**, the citation is:
  > Wu, Z., Song, S., Khosla, A., Yu, F., Zhang, L., Tang, X., and Xiao, J. *3D ShapeNets: A deep representation for volumetric shapes*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 1912–1920, 2015.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use.

In summary, the datasets extracted from the paper are:
1. **ShapeNet** - Chang et al., 2015
2. **ScanObjectNN** - Uy et al., 2019
3. **ModelNet40** - Wu et al., 2015

This structured approach ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their full citations as required.
