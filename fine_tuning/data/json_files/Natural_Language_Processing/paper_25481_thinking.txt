To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Cellular Network Connection Quality with Conformal" by Hanyang Jiang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and data description sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors focus on large-scale internet-quality datasets provided by Ookla, which suggests that a specific dataset is being utilized.

Next, I will examine **section 2 (Data Description)**, where the authors provide a detailed account of the dataset they used. They mention that the dataset is sourced from Ookla and includes performance metrics of mobile internet connections collected from 2019 to 2022. Key variables such as geographical coordinates, mean download and upload speeds, and the number of tests conducted are described, confirming that this is a significant dataset for their analysis.

The authors specifically mention two geographic regions where data was collected: **Georgia** and **New Mexico**. They provide the number of data points for each region, which are 28,587 for Georgia and 7,579 for New Mexico. This information is crucial for understanding the scope of the datasets.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the Ookla dataset. The authors reference the dataset as follows:

- For the **Ookla dataset**, the citation is:
  > Ookla. 2022. Global Broadband Performance Metrics: Q1. http://www.speedtest.net/global-index. Accessed: 2022-09-20.

Since the authors do not provide a specific title for the datasets from Georgia and New Mexico, I will refer to them collectively as the **Ookla Mobile Internet Quality Dataset** for clarity.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, ensuring that I include the full citation for the Ookla dataset as part of my output. This will ensure that the datasets are properly documented and can be referenced in future work.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for further processing or review.
