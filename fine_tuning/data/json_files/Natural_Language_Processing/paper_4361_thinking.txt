To extract datasets from the research paper titled "TAPEX: Table Pre-training via Learning a Neural SQL Executor" by Qian Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the datasets referenced. The abstract mentions that TAPEX is evaluated on four benchmark datasets, which indicates that I need to look for these datasets in detail.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors typically provide detailed information about the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, I will look for any specific mentions of datasets, including their names, characteristics, and any relevant statistics.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors evaluate TAPEX on the following four benchmark datasets:

1. **WikiSQL (WIKISQL-WEAK)**: This dataset is used for table-based question answering and contains 80,654 sentences. The authors mention that it requires filtering and optionally aggregating on table cell values.

2. **WikiTableQuestions (WIKITABLEQUESTIONS)**: This dataset is also for table-based question answering, specifically designed for more complex reasoning. It contains 22,033 sentences.

3. **SQA (Stanford Question Answering)**: This dataset is a conversational benchmark that requires the model to understand the context of previous questions. It consists of 17,553 sentences.

4. **TABFACT**: This dataset is used for fact verification based on tables and contains 118,275 sentences.

Now, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

- For **WikiSQL**, the citation is:
  > Zhong, V., Xiong, C., & Socher, R. (2017). *Seq2SQL: Generating Structured Queries from Natural Language Using Reinforcement Learning*. In Proceedings of the 2017 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP).

- For **WikiTableQuestions**, the citation is:
  > Pasupat, P., & Liang, P. (2015). *Compositional Semantic Parsing on Semi-Structured Tables*. In Proceedings of the 53rd Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL).

- For **SQA**, the citation is:
  > Iyyer, M., Yih, W.-t., & Chang, M.-W. (2017). *Search-based Neural Structured Learning for Sequential Question Answering*. In Proceedings of the 55th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL).

- For **TABFACT**, the citation is:
  > Chen, W., Wang, H., Chen, J., Zhang, Y., Wang, H., Li, S., Zhou, X., & Wang, W. Y. (2020). *TabFact: A Large-Scale Dataset for Table-Based Fact Verification*. In International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR).

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its citation. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture the datasets used in the research paper and provide proper references for future use.
