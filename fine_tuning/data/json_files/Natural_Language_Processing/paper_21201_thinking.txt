To extract datasets from the research paper titled "HDR Imaging for Dynamic Scenes with Events" by Xiaopeng Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and datasets section** of the paper. The abstract mentions the construction of large-scale synthetic and real-world datasets to evaluate the proposed method, indicating that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will focus on **section 6 (Datasets)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets they constructed. Here, they introduce two main datasets:

1. **BL2SHD-R (Real-world Dataset)**: This dataset is collected using a hybrid camera system and consists of blurry LDR images, event streams, and sharp LDR images. It is divided into two subsets based on motion patterns: BL2SHD-Rsimple (static scenes) and BL2SHD-Rcomplex (dynamic scenes). The authors provide statistics on the number of sequences, events, and pairs for training and testing.

2. **BL2SHD-S (Synthetic Dataset)**: This dataset is synthesized from existing HDR datasets and includes blurry LDR images, sharp HDR sequences, and corresponding events. The authors describe the process of generating this dataset, including the use of publicly available HDR datasets and the ESIM simulator for event synthesis.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations related to the datasets mentioned. The paper references several works that contribute to the datasets, but it does not provide specific citations for the datasets themselves. Therefore, I will note that the datasets are original contributions of the authors.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the names of the datasets, their descriptions, and any relevant citations or notes regarding their origin.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for review or further processing, ensuring that all necessary details are included for each dataset extracted from the paper.
