To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Long Text Generation Challenge" by Nikolay Mikhaylovskiy, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** to identify any mentions of datasets or tasks that involve datasets. The abstract discusses a shared task for long text generation, specifically mentioning a "Harry Potter generic audience fanfic," which suggests that there may be a dataset or prompt related to this task.

Next, I will examine the **Task Description section** (Section 3) to see if the authors provide specific details about any datasets used for the LTG Challenge. Here, they describe the task but do not explicitly mention a dataset. However, they refer to the evaluation metrics and protocols, which may imply the use of existing datasets for evaluation purposes.

In the **Related Work section** (Section 4), the authors discuss several previous works and datasets relevant to long text generation and evaluation. I will look for any datasets mentioned here that could be relevant to the LTG Challenge. They reference the **LongForm dataset** by Köksal et al. (2023), which is created for long text generation tasks. This is a potential dataset to include.

I will also note the mention of the **GEM benchmark** by Gehrmann et al. (2021), which provides a suite of tasks and datasets for natural language generation. While it may not be directly used in the LTG Challenge, it is relevant to the context of long text generation.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to retrieve full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. **LongForm Dataset**:
   > Abdullatif Köksal, Timo Schick, Anna Korhonen, and Hinrich Schütze. *LongForm: Optimizing Instruction Tuning for Long Text Generation with Corpus Extraction*. ArXiv abs/2304.08460, 2023.

2. **GEM Benchmark**:
   > Sebastian Gehrmann, Tosin Adewumi, Karmanya Aggarwal, et al. *The GEM Benchmark: Natural Language Generation, Evaluation, and Metrics*. In Proceedings of the 1st Workshop on Natural Language Generation, Evaluation, and Metrics (GEM 2021), pages 96–120, Online. Association for Computational Linguistics, 2021.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets relevant to the LTG Challenge as described in the paper.
