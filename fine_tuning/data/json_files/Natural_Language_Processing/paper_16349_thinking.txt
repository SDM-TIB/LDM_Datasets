To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Set-valued intrinsic measures of systemic risk" by Jana Hlavinov√° et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** of the paper to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract may provide a brief overview of the datasets used in the study, while the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets or data sources**. This section typically provides detailed descriptions of the datasets, including their names, characteristics, and how they were utilized in the research. If such a section is not explicitly labeled, I will check the **methods or experiments sections** where datasets are likely to be mentioned in the context of the analysis performed.

As I identify datasets, I will take note of their names and any relevant details provided by the authors, such as the number of observations, variables included, and the context in which they were used.

After gathering the dataset names and descriptions, I will consult the **References section** of the paper to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. I will look for original papers or reports that describe the datasets in detail.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like the "Eisenberg-Noe network," I will find the original citation for the Eisenberg and Noe (2001) paper, which is likely the source of the dataset.

Once I have compiled the dataset names, descriptions, and citations, I will ensure that each dataset is clearly articulated, including its relevance to the study and any specific characteristics that were highlighted by the authors.

Finally, I will organize this information in a clear and concise manner, ensuring that each dataset is properly cited and described, ready for any further processing or review.
