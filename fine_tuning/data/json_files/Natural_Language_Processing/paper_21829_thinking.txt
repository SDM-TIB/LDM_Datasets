To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Transformers Can Represent n-gram Language Models" by Anej Svete and Ryan Cotterell, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections. These sections often provide a summary of the research and may mention any datasets used for evaluation or comparison. In this case, the abstract does not explicitly mention any datasets, so I will proceed to the introduction.

Next, I will examine the **methodology and experiments sections** of the paper. These sections typically contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the experiments. I will look for any specific mentions of datasets, including their names, characteristics, and how they were utilized in the study.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors do not explicitly mention any datasets in the abstract or introduction. However, they refer to the theoretical aspects of language models and their representational capacity without citing specific datasets.

Since the paper focuses on theoretical analysis rather than empirical results, it may not include datasets in the traditional sense. Instead, it discusses concepts related to n-gram language models and transformer architectures.

To ensure thoroughness, I will also check the **references section** for any cited works that may involve datasets. If the authors reference previous studies that utilized specific datasets, I will document those as well.

After reviewing the references, I find that the paper cites several foundational works in the field of language modeling, but it does not provide specific datasets used in their own experiments.

In conclusion, this paper does not explicitly mention any datasets for extraction. However, I will summarize the findings and note that while the paper discusses theoretical frameworks and concepts, it does not provide empirical data or datasets for analysis.

If there were datasets mentioned, I would have compiled their details and full citations accordingly. Since there are none, I will conclude my extraction process here.
