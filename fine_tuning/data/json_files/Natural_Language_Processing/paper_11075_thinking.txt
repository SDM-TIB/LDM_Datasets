To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The Law of Parsimony in Gradient Descent for Learning Deep Linear Networks" by Can Yaras et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the implications of the research but does not specify any datasets. The introduction may provide context or references to datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their numerical experiments. I will look for any specific mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

In this paper, the authors discuss applications and experiments related to deep matrix completion and multi-class classification problems. They mention using synthetic datasets for their experiments, but I need to confirm if they provide any specific dataset names or references.

I will also check the **references section** to see if any datasets are cited there. This section often contains full citations for datasets that are used in the experiments, which is crucial for proper documentation.

After reviewing the relevant sections, I find that the authors do not mention any publicly available datasets by name but refer to their own synthetic datasets created for the experiments. Therefore, I will note that the datasets used are synthetic and created specifically for the study, and I will document this in the dataset entries.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring to include the necessary details about the datasets, such as their nature (synthetic), purpose (for experiments), and any relevant characteristics (e.g., number of samples, dimensions).

Finally, I will ensure to provide a clear citation for the paper itself, as it serves as the source of the datasets discussed.

Hereâ€™s how I will summarize the findings:

1. **Dataset Name**: Synthetic Dataset for Deep Matrix Completion
   - **Description**: A synthetic dataset created for the purpose of evaluating the proposed methods in deep matrix completion.
   - **Citation**: Yaras, C., Wang, P., Hu, W., Zhu, Z., Balzano, L., & Qu, Q. (2023). The Law of Parsimony in Gradient Descent for Learning Deep Linear Networks. [arXiv preprint arXiv:2306.XXXX].

2. **Dataset Name**: Synthetic Dataset for Multi-Class Classification
   - **Description**: A synthetic dataset generated for the multi-class classification experiments described in the paper.
   - **Citation**: Yaras, C., Wang, P., Hu, W., Zhu, Z., Balzano, L., & Qu, Q. (2023). The Law of Parsimony in Gradient Descent for Learning Deep Linear Networks. [arXiv preprint arXiv:2306.XXXX].

By following this structured approach, I ensure that I capture all relevant information about the datasets used in the research paper while providing proper citations.
