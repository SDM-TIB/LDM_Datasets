To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Latency-aware Road Anomaly Segmentation in Videos: A Photorealistic Dataset and New Metrics" by Beiwen Tian et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant details, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors contribute a video anomaly segmentation dataset for autonomous driving, which suggests that a specific dataset is being introduced.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Dataset)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset they created. Here, they describe the dataset as consisting of 120,000 high-resolution frames recorded at 60 FPS across 7 different towns, organized into 200 video sequences. This section will likely contain the most comprehensive details about the dataset, including its structure, resolution, and the types of annotations included.

In this section, the authors mention that the dataset is generated using the CARLA simulator, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's context. They also specify that the dataset includes pixel-level anomaly, semantic, and instance maps, which are essential for the intended applications.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the CARLA simulator, as it is integral to the dataset's creation. The citation for CARLA is:
> Alexey Dosovitskiy, German Ros, Felipe Codevilla, Antonio Lopez, and Vladlen Koltun. *CARLA: An open urban driving simulator*. In Proceedings of the 1st Annual Conference on Robot Learning, pages 1–16, 2017.

Additionally, I will look for any other datasets mentioned in the paper that may serve as benchmarks or comparisons. The authors reference several existing datasets in the related works section, such as Fishyscapes, Road Anomaly dataset, and others. I will extract their citations as well.

For example, the citation for the Fishyscapes dataset is:
> Hermann Blum, Paul-Edouard Sarlin, Juan Nieto, Roland Siegwart, and Cesar Cadena. *Fishyscapes: A benchmark for safe semantic segmentation in autonomous driving*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision Workshops, pages 0–0, 2019.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will help in accurately documenting the datasets referenced in the paper.
