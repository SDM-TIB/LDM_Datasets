To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Data-driven project planning: An integrated network learning, process mining, and constraint relaxation approach in favor of scheduling recurring projects" by Izack Cohen, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract indicates that the authors used "two real-world project datasets" to demonstrate their approach. This suggests that specific datasets are indeed referenced, and I need to find their names and details.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In the paper, the author mentions using two datasets: the **finishing projects dataset** and the **residential homes dataset**. I will note the context in which these datasets are used, including any relevant details about their structure or content.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for these datasets. The paper cites the following:

1. For the **finishing projects dataset**, the citation is:
   > J. Batselier and M. Vanhoucke. "Construction and evaluation framework for a real-life project database." *International Journal of Project Management*, vol. 33, no. 3, pp. 697–710, 2015.

2. For the **residential homes dataset**, the citation is:
   > M. Vanhoucke, J. Coelho, and J. Batselier. "An overview of project data for integrated project management and control." *Journal of Modern Project Management*, vol. 3, no. 3, pp. 6–21, 2016.

Now that I have the names and citations for the datasets, I will summarize the key details about each dataset, including their purpose and any specific attributes mentioned in the paper.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all necessary information is clearly presented for future reference or analysis.
