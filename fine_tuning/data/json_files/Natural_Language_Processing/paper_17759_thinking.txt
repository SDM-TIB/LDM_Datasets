To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Machine Learning Applications in Traumatic Brain Injury: A Spotlight on Mild TBI" by Hanem Ellethy et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a general overview, and I will look for specific references to datasets or studies that utilized datasets.

Next, I will examine the **sections that discuss machine learning applications** in TBI, particularly focusing on tables and figures that summarize studies and their associated datasets. For instance, I will look at **Table 2**, which lists studies that have used clinical data for TBI diagnosis and prognosis. This table will likely contain references to specific datasets used in those studies.

I will also check **Table 3**, which summarizes studies using CT images in TBI research. This table may provide insights into datasets related to imaging data, which is crucial for understanding the context of the machine learning applications discussed.

As I identify datasets, I will take note of their names and any relevant details provided in the text, such as the number of samples, types of data collected, and the specific applications for which they were used.

After gathering the dataset names, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is critical, as proper citation is essential for academic integrity and for readers who may wish to access the datasets themselves.

For example, if I find that the paper references the **TRACK-TBI dataset**, I will look for its citation in the references. The citation might look something like this:
> Yue, J. K., et al. "Transforming research and clinical knowledge in traumatic brain injury pilot: Multicenter implementation of the common data elements for traumatic brain injury." *Journal of Neurotrauma*, 2013, doi:10.1089/neu.2013.2970.

Once I have compiled the dataset names and their corresponding citations, I will ensure that I have accurately represented each dataset's purpose and context as described in the paper.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation, ready for further processing or review.
