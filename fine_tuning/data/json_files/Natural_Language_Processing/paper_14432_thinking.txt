To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning to Rewrite Prompts for Personalized Text Generation" by Cheng Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors demonstrate their method using datasets from three representative domains, which indicates that datasets are indeed present in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this case, I find that **section 6 (Experiment Setup)** explicitly lists the datasets used for evaluation. The authors mention three datasets:

1. **Avocado Research Email Collection**: This dataset is used for generating personalized emails.
2. **Amazon Review Data**: Specifically, the largest category of books is utilized for generating personalized reviews.
3. **Reddit Comments Dataset**: This dataset is used for generating personalized posts or comments.

I will now gather more details about each dataset, including their characteristics and any relevant statistics provided in the paper. The authors provide a summary of data statistics in **Table 1**, which includes information such as the number of users, current documents, and average characters per document for each dataset.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The paper cites the following sources:

- For the **Avocado Research Email Collection**:
  > Oard, D., Webber, W., Kirsch, D., & Golitsynskiy, S. (2015). *Avocado research email collection*. Philadelphia: Linguistic Data Consortium.

- For the **Amazon Review Data**:
  > Ni, J., Li, J., & McAuley, J. (2019). *Justifying recommendations using distantly-labeled reviews and fine-grained aspects*. In Proceedings of the 2019 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing and the 9th International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing (EMNLP-IJCNLP), 188–197.

- For the **Reddit Comments Dataset**:
  > Stuck_In_the_Matrix. (2015). *Reddit Public Comments (2007-10 through 2015-05)*. Retrieved from https://www.reddit.com/r/datasets/comments/3bxlg7/i_have_every_publicly_available_reddit_comment/

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and completeness.

In summary, I have extracted the following datasets from the paper:

1. **Avocado Research Email Collection**
   - Citation: Oard, D., Webber, W., Kirsch, D., & Golitsynskiy, S. (2015). *Avocado research email collection*. Philadelphia: Linguistic Data Consortium.

2. **Amazon Review Data**
   - Citation: Ni, J., Li, J., & McAuley, J. (2019). *Justifying recommendations using distantly-labeled reviews and fine-grained aspects*. In Proceedings of the 2019 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing and the 9th International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing (EMNLP-IJCNLP), 188–197.

3. **Reddit Comments Dataset**
   - Citation: Stuck_In_the_Matrix. (2015). *Reddit Public Comments (2007-10 through 2015-05)*. Retrieved from https://www.reddit.com/r/datasets/comments/3bxlg7/i_have_every_publicly_available_reddit_comment/

With this information, I am now ready to present the dataset entries in the required format for further processing or review.
