To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Topic Modeling in Embedding Spaces" by Adji B. Dieng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the study, which may include references to datasets used for experiments or evaluations.

Next, I will look for specific sections that typically contain dataset information, such as **section 6 (Empirical Study)**, where the authors discuss their experiments and the datasets they utilized. In this section, the authors mention two specific corpora:

1. **20Newsgroups Corpus**: This is a collection of newsgroup posts that has been preprocessed to filter out stop words and other infrequent words. The authors describe how they split the corpus into training, testing, and validation sets.

2. **New York Times Corpus**: This corpus consists of over 1.8 million articles spanning from 1987 to 2007. The authors detail their preprocessing steps and how they formed different versions of the corpus based on vocabulary size.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. However, since these datasets are well-known and widely used in the research community, they may not have specific citations in the references. Instead, I will note their common usage in the literature.

For the **20Newsgroups Corpus**, the citation is:
> Lang, K. (1995). *Newsweeder: Learning to filter netnews*. In Proceedings of the 1995 International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML), pages 331-339.

For the **New York Times Corpus**, while it may not have a formal citation, it is often referenced in studies involving large-scale text analysis. A common reference for the dataset is:
> The New York Times. (2007). *The New York Times Annotated Corpus*. Available at: https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2008T19.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This includes ensuring that I have accurately captured the names, descriptions, and citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper.
