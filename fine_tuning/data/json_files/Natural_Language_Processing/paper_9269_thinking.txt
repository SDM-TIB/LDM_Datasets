To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ChatGPT versus Traditional Question Answering for Knowledge Graphs: Current Status and Future Directions Towards Knowledge Graph Chatbots" by Reham Omar et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental evaluation sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions conducting evaluations using "four real KGs across various application domains," indicating that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors discuss the capabilities of conversational AI and question-answering systems, but I need to find specific dataset names.

In the **experimental evaluation section (4.1)**, the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for evaluation:

1. **DBpedia**: A general knowledge graph that contains structured information about various entities. The citation for DBpedia is:
   > Auer, S., Bizer, C., Kobilarov, G., Lehmann, J., Cyganiak, R., & Ives, Z. G. (2007). DBpedia: A nucleus for a web of open data. In The International Semantic Web Conference (ISWC), volume 4825, pages 722–735.

2. **YAGO**: Another general knowledge graph that integrates information from Wikipedia and WordNet. The citation for YAGO is:
   > Tanon, T., Weikum, G., & Suchanek, F. (2020). YAGO 4: A reason-able knowledge base. In Proceedings of the European Semantic Web Conference (ESWC), volume 12123, pages 583–596.

3. **DBLP**: A knowledge graph focused on computer science publications. The citation for DBLP is:
   > DBLP. (2022). DBLP: Computer Science Bibliography. Retrieved from https://dblp.org/rdf/release/dblp-2022-06-01.nt.gz.

4. **Microsoft Academic Graph (MAG)**: A knowledge graph that contains information about academic publications and citations. The citation for MAG is:
   > Microsoft Academic Graph. (2021). Microsoft Academic Graph. Retrieved from https://zenodo.org/record/4617285.

In the **performance evaluation section (4.3)**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for their experiments, providing further validation of their relevance.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as specified. This will ensure that the extracted information is complete and ready for further processing or review.
