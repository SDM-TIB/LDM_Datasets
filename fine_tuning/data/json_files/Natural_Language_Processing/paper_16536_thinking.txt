To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Holistic Evaluation of Text-to-Image Models" by Tony Lee et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the introduction of a new benchmark called **Holistic Evaluation of Text-to-Image Models (HEIM)**, which suggests that there are datasets involved in this evaluation. The introduction further elaborates on the evaluation of 62 scenarios, indicating that these scenarios may correspond to specific datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets** section or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors describe various scenarios used for evaluation, which are likely based on existing datasets. I will pay close attention to **Table 2**, which lists the scenarios and their descriptions, as this table may provide insights into the datasets used.

Upon reviewing **Table 2**, I identify several datasets mentioned:

1. **MS-COCO**: A widely-used dataset of caption-image pairs about common objects. The paper references the 2014 validation set for evaluating image quality and text-image alignment.

2. **CUB-200-2011**: A dataset of 200 bird species with paired text-image data.

5. **Winoground**: A dataset focusing on examining the reasoning capabilities of text-to-image models.
   - Citation:

6. **Inappropriate Image Prompts (I2P)**: A collection of prompts likely to produce inappropriate images.
   - Citation:

Next, I will check the **References section** to ensure I have the correct citations for each dataset. I will compile the full citations for each dataset mentioned above.

Finally, I will summarize the datasets and their citations in a structured format, ensuring that I have accurately captured all relevant information for future reference or processing.
