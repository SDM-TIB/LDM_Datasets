To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Mapping Disruption Sources in the Power Grid and Implications for Resilience" by Maureen S. Golan and Javad Mohammadi, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors analyze data from the **U.S. Department of Energy DOE-417 Electric Emergency and Disturbance Report**, which suggests that this dataset is central to their research.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **methodology section**. Here, the authors describe using the DOE-417 form, which is a mandatory report for utilities to file regarding emergency incidents. They mention analyzing **2,286 incidents** from annual summaries spanning **2012-2021**. This indicates that the dataset is not only referenced but also quantitatively analyzed.

In the **results and discussion sections**, the authors elaborate on the findings derived from the DOE-417 dataset, discussing various event types and their implications for power grid resilience. This reinforces the importance of the DOE-417 dataset in their analysis.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citation for the DOE-417 dataset. The relevant citation is:

- **U.S. Department of Energy. Electric disturbance events (DOE-417).** [Online]. Available: https://www.oe.netl.doe.gov/oe417.aspx

This citation provides the necessary details about the dataset, including its title and where it can be accessed.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring to include the full citation as it is crucial for proper attribution and reference in any subsequent work or analysis. 

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the dataset used in this research paper.
