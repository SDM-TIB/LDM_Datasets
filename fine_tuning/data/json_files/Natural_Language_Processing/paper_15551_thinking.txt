To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Moral Sparks in Social Media Narratives" by Ruijie Xi and Munindar P. Singh, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors examined posts from the subreddit r/AmITheAsshole, which suggests that this subreddit may serve as a dataset for their analysis.

Next, I will focus on the **data collection section (Section 3)**, where the authors describe their methodology for gathering data. They mention using the **PushShift API** and the **Reddit API** to collect posts and comments from the r/AmITheAsshole subreddit. This indicates that the dataset consists of Reddit posts and comments related to moral judgments.

In **Section 3.1 (Collect Data)**, the authors specify that they collected **351,067 posts** and **10.3 million top-level comments** from the subreddit, which confirms the scale of the dataset. They also mention filtering criteria to ensure the quality of the data, such as selecting posts with a minimum word count and a minimum number of comments.

The authors also state that they have released their dataset, providing a link to it in the paper. This is crucial for citation purposes.

Now, I will compile the information about the dataset and its citation:

1. **Dataset Name**: r/AmITheAsshole Dataset
   - **Description**: A dataset consisting of posts and comments from the subreddit r/AmITheAsshole, focusing on moral judgments and reasoning in social media narratives.
   - **Size**: 351,067 posts and 10.3 million top-level comments.
   - **Link**: [Dataset Link](https://zenodo.org/record/8350526)

Next, I will ensure to provide the full citation for the dataset as mentioned in the paper. The citation for the dataset is as follows:

> Xi, R., & Singh, M. P. (2023). Moral Sparks in Social Media Narratives. *Proceedings of the International AAAI Conference on Web and Social Media*, 17, 1-12. Retrieved from https://zenodo.org/record/8350526

Finally, I will summarize the findings and ensure that I have accurately captured the dataset information and citation for future reference or processing.
