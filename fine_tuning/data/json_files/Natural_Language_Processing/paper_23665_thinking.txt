To extract datasets from the research paper titled "M3GIA: A Cognition Inspired Multilingual and Multimodal General Intelligence Ability Benchmark" by Wei Song et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract introduces the M3GIA benchmark, which suggests that there may be datasets involved in its construction and evaluation.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors describe the M3GIA benchmark and mention that it contains a total of **1,800 multiple-choice problems** across various cognitive factors, which indicates that the dataset is a significant part of their work.

In the **dataset composition section**, the authors specify that M3GIA includes questions in **six languages**: English, Chinese, Spanish, Korean, Portuguese, and French. This is crucial information as it highlights the multilingual aspect of the dataset.

I will also check the **appendices** or **dataset documentation** sections for any additional details about the dataset, such as how it was collected, its structure, and any specific characteristics that define it.

Now, I will compile the datasets identified in the paper along with their full citations. The main dataset mentioned is:

1. **M3GIA Dataset**: This dataset is designed to evaluate the cognitive abilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) based on the Cattell-Horn-Carroll (CHC) model of intelligence. It consists of **1,800 multiple-choice questions** across five cognitive factors and is available in six languages.

For the citation, I will refer to the paper itself, as it provides the necessary details for proper attribution. The citation for the M3GIA dataset is:

> Wei Song, Yadong Li, Jianhua Xu, Guowei Wu, Lingfeng Ming, Kexin Yi, Weihua Luo, Houyi Li, Yi Du, Fangda Guo, Kaicheng Yu. *M3GIA: A Cognition Inspired Multilingual and Multimodal General Intelligence Ability Benchmark*. Preprint. Under review.

After gathering this information, I will ensure that I have accurately represented the dataset and its citation in the required format for further processing or review.
