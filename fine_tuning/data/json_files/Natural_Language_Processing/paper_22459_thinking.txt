To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MADRL-Based Rate Adaptation for 360° Video Streaming with Multi-Viewpoint Prediction" by Haopeng Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets used for experiments or evaluations.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used in their research. In this paper, the authors mention using the **MMSys18 dataset** for evaluating their proposed method. I will note down the details provided about this dataset, including its purpose and any specific characteristics mentioned.

In the **implementation details section**, the authors provide further context about the MMSys18 dataset, stating that it contains viewpoint trajectories of 57 participants watching 19 different 360° videos. This information is crucial for understanding the dataset's scope and application.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the MMSys18 dataset. The citation is as follows:
> E. J. David, J. Gutiérrez, A. Coutrot, M. P. Da Silva, and P. L. Callet, “A dataset of head and eye movements for 360° videos,” in Proceedings of the 9th ACM Multimedia Systems Conference, 2018, pp. 432–437.

Additionally, the authors mention using two public network trace datasets, **FCC** and **HSDPA**, for evaluating their proposed method under real network conditions. I will extract the relevant details about these datasets as well.

For the **FCC dataset**, the citation is:
> F. C. Commission, “Raw data—measurement broadband america,” 2016. [Online]. Available: https://www.fcc.gov/oet/mba/raw-data-releases

For the **HSDPA dataset**, the citation is:
> H. Riiser, P. Vigmostad, C. Griwodz, and P. Halvorsen, “Commute path bandwidth traces from 3G networks: Analysis and applications,” in Proceedings of the 4th ACM Multimedia Systems Conference, 2013, pp. 114–118.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference.

In summary, the datasets extracted from the paper are:
1. **MMSys18 Dataset**: 
   - Citation: E. J. David, J. Gutiérrez, A. Coutrot, M. P. Da Silva, and P. L. Callet, “A dataset of head and eye movements for 360° videos,” in Proceedings of the 9th ACM Multimedia Systems Conference, 2018, pp. 432–437.

2. **FCC Dataset**: 
   - Citation: F. C. Commission, “Raw data—measurement broadband america,” 2016. [Online]. Available: https://www.fcc.gov/oet/mba/raw-data-releases

3. **HSDPA Dataset**: 
   - Citation: H. Riiser, P. Vigmostad, C. Griwodz, and P. Halvorsen, “Commute path bandwidth traces from 3G networks: Analysis and applications,” in Proceedings of the 4th ACM Multimedia Systems Conference, 2013, pp. 114–118.

With this information, I am now ready to present the dataset entries in the required format for further processing or review.
