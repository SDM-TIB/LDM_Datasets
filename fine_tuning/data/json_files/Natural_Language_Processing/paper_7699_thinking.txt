To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "MTS Kion Implicit Contextualised Sequential Dataset for Movie Recommendation" by Aleksandr Petrov et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the paper presents a new dataset collected from real users of the MTS Kion video-on-demand platform, which suggests that a dataset is indeed described.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Kion Dataset)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the dataset. Here, they mention that the dataset includes 5,476,251 interactions from 962,179 users with 15,706 items, along with rich contextual and side information. This section is crucial as it contains the specifics of the dataset, including its characteristics and the time frame of data collection.

In **section 2.2 (Dataset Description)**, the authors elaborate on the dataset's features, such as the implicit nature of the interactions, the inclusion of user demographics, and the rich movie metadata. This section confirms that the dataset is comprehensive and suitable for various research applications.

I will also check the **comparison section (2.4)**, where the authors compare the Kion dataset with existing datasets like MovieLens and Netflix. This comparison highlights the unique aspects of the Kion dataset, reinforcing its significance in the field of movie recommendation.

Finally, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The citation for the dataset is as follows:

- For the **MTS Kion Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Aleksandr Petrov, Ildar Safilo, Daria Tikhonovich, and Dmitry Ignatov. 2022. *MTS Kion Implicit Contextualised Sequential Dataset for Movie Recommendation*. In Proceedings of 16th ACM Conference on Recommender Systems - Workshop on Context-Aware Recommender Systems (RecSys CARS â€™22). ACM, New York, NY, USA, 6 pages. https://doi.org/<TBC>

Now, I will compile the information about the dataset, including its description and citation, ensuring that I adhere to the required format for clarity and completeness. This will prepare me to present the dataset information in a structured manner for further use or analysis.
