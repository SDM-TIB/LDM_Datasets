To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On-device Online Learning and Semantic Management of TinyML Systems" by Haoyu Ren et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. In the abstract, the authors refer to three real-world TinyML applications, which suggests that datasets are involved, but I need to find specific names.

Next, I will examine **section 5 (Real-World Applications)**, where the authors describe the applications in detail. Here, they explicitly mention the datasets used for each application:

1. **Omniglot Dataset**: This dataset is used for handwritten character image classification. It comprises 1623 characters representing 50 alphabets, with up to 60 image samples available for each character.

2. **Speech Command Dataset**: This dataset is utilized for keyword spotting audio classification. It includes 35 distinct keywords, with over 1000 audio samples per word.

3. **Siemens Proprietary Dataset**: This dataset is used for smart building presence detection, consisting of environmental sensor readings and time-related information collected from 61 rooms in a commercial building.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **Omniglot Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Brenden M Lake, Ruslan Salakhutdinov, and Joshua B Tenenbaum. *The Omniglot challenge: a 3-year progress report*. Current Opinion in Behavioral Sciences, 29, 97â€“104, 2019. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cobeha.2019.04.007

- For the **Speech Command Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Pete Warden. *Speech Commands: A Dataset for Limited-Vocabulary Speech Recognition*. 2018. https://doi.org/10.48550/ARXIV.1804.03209

- The **Siemens Proprietary Dataset** does not have a publicly available citation, as it is proprietary to Siemens.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this into a structured format for further processing or review. Each dataset will be documented with its name, description, and citation, ensuring clarity and completeness in the extraction process.
