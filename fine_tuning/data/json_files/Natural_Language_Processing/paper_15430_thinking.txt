To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DocStormer: Revitalizing Multi-Degraded Colored Document Images to Pristine PDF" by Chaowei Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors propose a novel dataset called **MD-CDE** for training and evaluation, which is a strong lead.

Next, I will look into **section 4 (MD-CDE dataset)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the dataset. Here, they explain the purpose of the dataset, the types of degradations it addresses (wrinkles, shadows, and ink bleed-through), and the construction process. This section is crucial as it contains the specifics about the dataset's content and its intended use.

In this section, the authors describe the dataset construction process, including the number of images, the types of images included, and how they were processed. They mention that the MD-CDE dataset consists of 39,590 images for training and three test sets, which include synthetic and real-world images.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the MD-CDE dataset. Since the dataset is newly introduced in this paper, it may not have a separate citation in the references. However, the authors might reference other datasets or methods used in constructing MD-CDE, which could be useful for context.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the MD-CDE dataset as follows:

- **MD-CDE Dataset**: This dataset is introduced in the paper and is specifically designed for restoring multi-degraded colored document images. It includes 39,590 training images and three test sets, focusing on common degradations found in real-world document images.

Finally, I will ensure that the citation for the paper itself is included, as it serves as the primary source for the dataset:

> Chaowei Liu, Jichun Li, Yihua Teng, Chaoqun Wang, Nuo Xu, Jihao Wu, Dandan Tu. *DocStormer: Revitalizing Multi-Degraded Colored Document Images to Pristine PDF*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2023.

With this information, I will be ready to create the dataset entry in the required format for further processing or review.
