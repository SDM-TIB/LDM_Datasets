To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Spatiotemporal Deep Neural Network for Fine-Grained Multi-Horizon Wind Prediction" by Fanling Huang and Yangdong Deng, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors constructed a dataset using real-world data from an international airport, which suggests that there is a specific dataset to extract.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experiment and Application)**, where the authors describe the dataset in detail. Here, they mention that the dataset consists of nine groups of observation data collected at nine closely distributed stations and one group of Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) data for the airfield. The data spans from March 2018 to September 2019, totaling 13,176 time points.

The authors also provide a table (Table 1) that lists the meteorological variables included in the dataset, such as wind speed, lateral wind speed, longitudinal wind speed, wind direction, temperature, relative humidity, and sea-level pressure. This detailed description confirms the existence of a well-defined dataset.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. However, the paper does not provide a specific citation for the dataset itself, as it is a newly constructed dataset by the authors. Instead, they mention that they will publicize the dataset and source code for future research.

Since the dataset is original and not derived from previously published datasets, I will note that the authors have created a unique dataset for their study, but I will not be able to provide a formal citation like those found in traditional datasets.

Finally, I will summarize the dataset information as follows:

1. **Dataset Name**: Airport Wind Prediction Dataset
   - **Description**: A dataset constructed using real-world data from one of the busiest international airports in China, consisting of nine groups of observation data collected at nine closely distributed stations and one group of NWP data. The dataset includes hourly time series of various meteorological variables from March 2018 to September 2019.
   - **Variables**: Wind speed, lateral wind speed, longitudinal wind speed, wind direction, temperature, relative humidity, sea-level pressure.
   - **Time Period**: March 2018 to September 2019.
   - **Total Time Points**: 13,176 time points.

In conclusion, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing, ensuring that I highlight the original nature of the dataset created by the authors.
