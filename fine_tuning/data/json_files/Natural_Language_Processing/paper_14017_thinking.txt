To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Tri-modal Embeddings for Zero-Shot Soundscape Mapping" by Subash Khanal et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract mentions the use of the **SoundingEarth dataset**, which is a strong indication that this dataset is central to the research.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Approach)**, where the authors describe their methodology in detail. Here, they state that they use the **SoundingEarth dataset** for training and evaluation. The dataset is described as containing over 50,000 geotagged audio recordings from 136 countries, paired with overhead images. This section provides crucial details about the dataset's composition and purpose.

In **section 4 (Experimental Details)**, the authors elaborate on the dataset's characteristics, including the removal of audio files with a sampling frequency less than 16k, resulting in a final dataset size of 50,792 samples. This reinforces the importance of the **SoundingEarth dataset** in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the **SoundingEarth dataset**. The authors reference a project called Radio Aporee, which hosts the dataset. The citation for this dataset is:

> Radio Aporee. *https://aporee.org/maps*.

Since the paper does not provide a formal citation for the **SoundingEarth dataset** beyond the website, I will note that the dataset is hosted on the Radio Aporee platform.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the dataset as required.

The dataset extracted from the paper is:

1. **SoundingEarth Dataset**: Contains over 50,000 geotagged audio recordings from 136 countries, paired with overhead images. The dataset is used for training and evaluating the proposed method.

Citation:
> Radio Aporee. *https://aporee.org/maps*.

This process ensures that I have accurately identified and documented the relevant dataset from the research paper, along with its citation.
