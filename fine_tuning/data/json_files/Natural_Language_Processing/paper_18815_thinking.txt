To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Discovering Temporally-Aware Reinforcement Learning Algorithms" by Matthew T. Jackson et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a high-level overview, and while it may not explicitly mention datasets, it can hint at the types of experiments conducted.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 5) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. I will look for any specific names of datasets or environments that are utilized in their experiments. In this paper, the authors mention using environments from **MinAtar** and **Brax** for their evaluations.

I will then check the **experimental setup section** (Section 5.1) for more details on the datasets. Here, the authors specify that they meta-trained on **Space Invaders** from the MinAtar suite and evaluated on various environments, including **Brax** and other configurations from the MinAtar suite.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets mentioned in the paper are as follows:

1. **MinAtar**:
   > Young, K., & Tian, T. (2019). *Minatar: An Atari-inspired testbed for thorough and reproducible reinforcement learning experiments*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1903.03176.

2. **Brax**:
   > Freeman, C. D., Frey, E., Raichuk, A., Girgin, S., Mordatch, J., & Bachem, O. (2021). *Braxâ€”a differentiable physics engine for large scale rigid body simulation*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2106.13281.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
