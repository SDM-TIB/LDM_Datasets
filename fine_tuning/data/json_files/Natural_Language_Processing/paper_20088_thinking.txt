To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Survey on Temporal Knowledge Graph: Representation Learning and Applications" by Li Cai et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and background sections** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract provides a general overview, but the background section is likely to contain more specific details about datasets used in the context of temporal knowledge graphs.

In **section 2.2 (Datasets)**, the authors explicitly list four commonly used datasets for temporal knowledge graph representation learning:

1. **ICEWS**: The Integrated Crisis Early Warning System captures and processes millions of data points from various sources to predict and respond to global events. The paper mentions three subsets: ICEWS14, ICEWS05-15, and ICEWS18, which correspond to events from different years.

2. **GDELT**: The Global Database of Events, Language, and Tone is a comprehensive database that includes news from around the world in over 100 languages, updated every 15 minutes.

3. **Wikidata**: A collaborative knowledge base that supports various Wikimedia projects and contains temporal information.

4. **YAGO**: A linked database that integrates data from Wikipedia and WordNet, adding temporal and spatial information to many knowledge items.

Next, I will verify the details of these datasets by checking the **References section** to find their full citations. The citations for these datasets are as follows:

- For **ICEWS**, the citation is:
  > O’Brien, S.P. (2010). Crisis early warning and decision support: Contemporary approaches and thoughts on future research. *International Studies Review*, 12, 87–104. https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1468-2486.2009.00914.x.

- For **GDELT**, the citation is:
  > Leetaru, K., & Schrodt, P.A. (2013). GDELT: Global data on events, location, and tone, 1979–2012. In *ISA Annual Convention*. https://doi.org/10.1145/3209978.3210187.

- For **Wikidata**, the citation is:
  > Vrandečić, D., & Krötzsch, M. (2014). Wikidata: A free collaborative knowledge base. *Communications of the ACM*, 57(10), 78–85. https://doi.org/10.1145/2629489.

- For **YAGO**, the citation is:
  > Hoffart, J., et al. (2011). YAGO2: Exploring and querying world knowledge in time, space, context, and many languages. In *Proceedings of the 20th International Conference Companion on World Wide Web*. https://doi.org/10.1145/1963192.1963296.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their respective references from the paper.
