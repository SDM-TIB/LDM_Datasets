To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "A new behavioral model for portfolio selection using the Half-Full/Half-Empty approach" by F. Cesarone et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and empirical analysis sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted an empirical analysis based on **three real-world datasets**, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Description of datasets and performance measures)**, where the authors provide a clear description of the datasets used in their analysis. Here, they list the following datasets:

1. **DIJA (Dow Jones Industrial Average, USA)**: This dataset consists of 28 assets and includes 3,715 observations from October 2006 to December 2020.

2. **NASDAQ 100 (National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation, USA)**: This dataset comprises 54 assets and also contains 3,715 observations from October 2006 to December 2020.

3. **FTSE 100 (Financial Times Stock Exchange, UK)**: This dataset includes 80 assets and has 3,715 observations from October 2006 to December 2020.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. However, since these datasets are publicly available and the paper does not provide specific citations for them, I will note that they can be accessed through the author's website mentioned in the paper.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the names and descriptions of each dataset, along with the relevant access information.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring that each dataset is clearly defined and includes the necessary details for future reference.
