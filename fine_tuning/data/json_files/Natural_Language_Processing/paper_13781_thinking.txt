To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Exploring Non-additive Randomness on ViT against Query-Based Black-Box Attacks" by Jindong Gu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are referenced or implied. The abstract discusses the exploration of non-additive randomness in Vision Transformers (ViTs) and mentions experiments, which may indicate the use of specific datasets.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (section 4) closely, as this is where datasets are typically detailed. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets used for evaluation or training. If the authors describe their experimental setup, they may list the datasets along with their characteristics.

In the **experiments section**, I will pay particular attention to any subsections that might be dedicated to datasets or experimental setups. If the authors mention specific datasets, I will note their names, descriptions, and any relevant statistics (e.g., number of samples, types of tasks).

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets themselves.

For example, if the authors mention using the **ImageNet dataset**, I would look for its citation in the references. The citation might look something like this:
> Olga Russakovsky, Jia Deng, Hao Sheng, et al. *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 115(3):211-252, 2015.

If they mention another dataset, such as **CIFAR-10**, I would find its citation as well:
> Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. *CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets*. 2009.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, including their names, descriptions, and citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference.

Finally, I will ensure that I have accurately captured the full citations for each dataset, as this is essential for academic integrity and for readers who may wish to explore the datasets further.
