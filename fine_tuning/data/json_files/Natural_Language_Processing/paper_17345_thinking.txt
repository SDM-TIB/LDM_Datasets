To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Neural Contextual Bandits for Personalized Recommendation" by Yikun Ban, Yunzhe Qi, and Jingrui He, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections that discuss experiments or methodologies** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a general overview, but I need to look for specific references to datasets in the body of the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** and **outline sections** to see if the authors mention any datasets that are used for their experiments or theoretical discussions. If they refer to any datasets, I will note their names and any relevant details provided.

I will then examine the **experiments or methodology sections** (if available) to find explicit mentions of datasets used in their research. This is crucial as it often contains detailed descriptions of the datasets, including their sizes, types, and any specific characteristics that are relevant to the study.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is important for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily. I will look for papers or resources that describe the datasets in detail.

For example, if the authors mention using a dataset like "MovieLens" for their experiments, I would look for the original paper or source that describes the MovieLens dataset and note its citation.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations into a structured format that clearly presents each dataset's details.

Finally, I will ensure that all entries are accurate and complete, ready for any further processing or review.
