To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Survey on Deep Learning Techniques for Action Anticipation" by Zeyun Zhong et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and the datasets section** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the paper reviews various methods and datasets used for action anticipation, which indicates that there will be specific datasets listed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Evaluation Datasets and Metrics)**, as this section is likely to contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the studies discussed. In this section, the authors provide a table (Table 3) that summarizes several benchmark datasets for human action anticipation. I will carefully extract the names of the datasets, their characteristics, and any relevant details provided.

The datasets mentioned in the paper include:

1. **TV-I Dataset**: 
   - Year: 2010
   - Type: Activities of daily living (ADL)
   - Citation: Patron-Perez, A., Marszalek, M., Zisserman, A., & Reid, I. (2010). *High five: Recognising human interactions in tv shows*. In BMVC.

2. **50Salads Dataset**: 
   - Year: 2013
   - Type: Cooking
   - Citation: G. A. Sigurdsson et al. (2016). *Hollywood in homes: Crowdsourcing data collection for activity understanding*. In ECCV.

3. **CAD-120 Dataset**: 
   - Year: 2013
   - Type: ADL
   - Citation: K. Li et al. (2014). *Prediction of Human Activity by Discovering Temporal Sequence Patterns*. TPAMI.

4. **Breakfast Dataset**: 
   - Year: 2014
   - Type: Cooking
   - Citation: Kuehne, H., Arslan, A., & Serre, T. (2014). *The Language of Actions: Recovering the Syntax and Semantics of Goal-Directed Human Activities*. In CVPR.

5. **THUMOS14 Dataset**: 
   - Year: 2014
   - Type: Sports
   - Citation: Y.-G. Jiang et al. (2014). *Thumos challenge: Action recognition with a large number of classes*. 

6. **Charades Dataset**: 
   - Year: 2016
   - Type: ADL
   - Citation: G. A. Sigurdsson et al. (2016). *Hollywood in homes: Crowdsourcing data collection for activity understanding*. In ECCV.

7. **EpicKitchens Dataset**: 
   - Year: 2018
   - Type: Cooking
   - Citation: Damen, D. et al. (2018). *Scaling egocentric vision: The epic-kitchens dataset*. In ECCV.

8. **Ego4D Dataset**: 
   - Year: 2020
   - Type: ADL
   - Citation: Grauman, K. et al. (2022). *Ego4D: Around the World in 3,000 Hours of Egocentric Video*. In CVPR.

9. **Assembly101 Dataset**: 
   - Year: 2022
   - Type: ADL
   - Citation: Sener, F. et al. (2022). *Assembly101: A large-scale multi-view video dataset for understanding procedural activities*. In CVPR.

After identifying these datasets, I will ensure to note down their characteristics, such as the type of activities they cover, the year of publication, and any specific features mentioned in the paper.

Finally, I will compile the extracted dataset information along with their full citations into a structured format for easy reference and further processing.
