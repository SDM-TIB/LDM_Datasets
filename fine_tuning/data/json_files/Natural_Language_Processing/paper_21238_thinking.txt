To extract datasets from the research paper titled "RaSim: A Range-aware High-fidelity RGB-D Data Simulation Pipeline for Real-world Applications" by Xingyu Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors developed a simulation pipeline (RaSim) for generating high-fidelity depth data, which suggests that they may have created or utilized specific datasets.

Next, I will examine the **methodology** and **experiments** sections, particularly focusing on any subsections that discuss datasets. In the introduction, the authors mention that they conducted experiments on two real-world datasets: **ClearGrasp** and **YCB-V**. This is a strong indication that these datasets are crucial to their research.

In the **C. RaSim Dataset** section, the authors describe the dataset they created using the RaSim pipeline. They mention that it comprises over 206K images across 9,835 diverse scenes, along with pixel-level semantic annotations and depth maps. This dataset is significant for their experiments and should be included.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. **ClearGrasp Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Sajjan, S., Moore, M., Pan, M., Nagaraja, G., Lee, J., Zeng, A., & Song, S. (2020). Clear grasp: 3D shape estimation of transparent objects for manipulation. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA), pp. 3634â€“3642.

2. **YCB-V Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Xiang, Y., Schmidt, T., Narayanan, V., & Fox, D. (2018). PoseCNN: A convolutional neural network for 6D object pose estimation in cluttered scenes. In Robotics: Science and Systems Conference (RSS).

3. **RaSim Dataset**: Since this dataset is created by the authors themselves, I will cite it as follows:
   > Liu, X., Zhang, C., Wang, G., Zhang, R., & Ji, X. (2023). RaSim: A Range-aware High-fidelity RGB-D Data Simulation Pipeline for Real-world Applications. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA).

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described accurately and includes its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
