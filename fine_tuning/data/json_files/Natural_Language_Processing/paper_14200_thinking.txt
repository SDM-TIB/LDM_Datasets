To extract datasets from the research paper titled "IBVC: Interpolation-driven B-frame Video Compression" by Chenming Xu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and it may mention datasets used for experiments or evaluations.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for training and testing their models. In this section, I will look for any specific names of datasets, their characteristics, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **Vimeo-90K Dataset**: This dataset is used to train the artifact reduction codec. It contains 4,278 videos with 89,800 independent sequences of 256×256 resolution.

2. **UVG Dataset**: This dataset is used for testing and evaluation. It consists of 7 sequences at 1080P resolution.

3. **HEVC Datasets**: The authors mention using 19 video sequences from HEVC datasets, which include various classes (Class B, Class C, Class D, Class E, and Class E’), each with different resolutions.

Now, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. 

- For the **Vimeo-90K Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Xue, T., Chen, B., Wu, J., Wei, D., & Freeman, W. T. (2019). Video enhancement with task-oriented flow. *International Journal of Computer Vision*, 127(8), 1106-1125.

- For the **UVG Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Mercat, A., Viitanen, M., & Vanne, J. (2020). UVG dataset: 50/120fps 4k sequences for video codec analysis and development. In *Proceedings of the ACM International Conference on Multimedia* (pp. 297-302).

- For the **HEVC Datasets**, the citation is:
  > Bossen, F., et al. (2013). Common test conditions and software reference configurations. *JCTVC-L1100*, 12(7).

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation, ready for structured output or further processing.
