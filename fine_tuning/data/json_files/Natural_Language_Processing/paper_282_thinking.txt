To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Learning and Word Embeddings for Tweet Classification for Crisis Response" by Reem ALRashdi and Simon Oâ€™Keefe, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract states that the authors evaluate their models on the **CrisisNLP dataset**, which indicates that this dataset is central to their research.

Next, I will look into the **experiments** section, specifically **section V (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly mention using the **CrisisNLP dataset** to evaluate their classifiers. They describe it as a collection of small datasets containing annotated tweets related to various crisis events, which confirms its relevance.

In the **discussion** and **conclusion** sections, the authors reiterate the importance of the CrisisNLP dataset for their experiments, further solidifying its role in their research.

Now, I will check the **References section** for the full citation of the CrisisNLP dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:

- **CrisisNLP dataset**:
  > M. Imran, P. Mitra, and C. Castillo. *Twitter as a lifeline: Human-annotated twitter corpora for NLP of crisis-related messages*. 2016. [online]. Available: arXiv preprint arXiv:1605.05894. [Accessed Sep. 8, 2018].

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets, I will focus solely on the CrisisNLP dataset for my final output.

Finally, I will compile the information about the CrisisNLP dataset, including its description and citation, ensuring that the citation is complete and accurate for future reference.
