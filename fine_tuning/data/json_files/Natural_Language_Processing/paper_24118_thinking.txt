To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Benchmarks and Metrics for Evaluations of Code Generation: A Critical Review" by Debalina Ghosh Paul, Hong Zhu, and Ian Bayley, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** to identify any mentions of datasets or benchmarks. The abstract indicates that the paper reviews existing work on testing and evaluation of tools for code generation, which suggests that datasets may be discussed in detail.

Next, I will examine **section III (Benchmarks)**, where the authors summarize various benchmarks used for evaluating large language models (LLMs) in code generation. This section is likely to contain explicit mentions of datasets.

In **Table II**, the authors list several benchmarks along with their sources. The benchmarks mentioned include:

1. **APPS**: Sourced from coding challenges.
2. **HumanEval**: Sourced from domain experts.
3. **MBPP**: Sourced from crowdsourcing.
4. **MathQA-Python**: Sourced from the MathQA dataset.
5. **ClassEval**: Sourced from GitHub repositories.
6. **CoderEval**: Sourced from GitHub repositories.
7. **MultiPL-E**: Sourced from forums like Stack Overflow.
8. **DS-1000**: Sourced from GitHub repositories.
9. **HumanEval+**: Sourced from GitHub repositories.
10. **CONCODE**: Sourced from GitHub and the CodeSearchNet dataset.
11. **R-benchmark**: Sourced from GitHub repositories.
12. **JuICe**: Sourced from the 2019 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing.
13. **Exec-CSN**: Sourced from GitHub.
14. **EvoCodeBench**: Sourced from GitHub.

I will also check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. The citations will provide the necessary details for each benchmark.

For example, the citation for **APPS** is:
> Hendrycks, D., et al. "Measuring Coding Challenge Competence With APPS." In Proc. of 35th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems - Datasets and Benchmarks Track, 2021. Also available as arXiv:2105.09938.

The citation for **HumanEval** is:
> Chen, M., et al. "Evaluating large language models trained on code." arXiv:2107.03374, 2021.

I will continue this process for each benchmark listed in Table II, ensuring to capture the full citation for each dataset.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets referenced in the paper.
