To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Viewpoint Robustness in Bird’s Eye View Segmentation" by Tzofi Klinghoffer et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors are releasing datasets for benchmarking future work on viewpoint robustness in autonomous vehicles (AV). This suggests that there are specific datasets that will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology and experiments sections** where datasets are typically described. In this paper, the authors mention using synthetic data rendered from CARLA and NVIDIA DRIVE Sim for their experiments. I will look for specific details about these datasets, including their characteristics and how they were used in the experiments.

In **section 5.1 (Datasets)**, the authors explicitly mention two datasets:

1. **CARLA Dataset**: This dataset is rendered from the CARLA simulator and consists of both training and testing data. It allows for isolated analysis of the impact of viewpoint changes on BEV segmentation models.

2. **NVIDIA DRIVE Sim Dataset**: This dataset is noted for being significantly more photorealistic and includes test sets from a diverse set of camera viewpoints. It is used to evaluate models trained on real data.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The CARLA dataset is cited as follows:
- Alexey Dosovitskiy, German Ros, Felipe Codevilla, Antonio Lopez, and Vladlen Koltun. *CARLA: An Open Urban Driving Simulator*. In Conference on Robot Learning, pages 1–16, PMLR, 2017.

For the NVIDIA DRIVE Sim dataset, the citation is:
- NVIDIA. *NVIDIA DRIVE Sim*. https://developer.nvidia.com/drive/simulation, 2021.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and future reference. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations.
