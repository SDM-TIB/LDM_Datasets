To extract datasets from the research paper titled "LM Transparency Tool" by Igor Tufanov et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are mentioned or implied. The abstract discusses the LM Transparency Tool and its capabilities but does not explicitly mention any datasets. The introduction also focuses on the tool's features and does not provide specific dataset names.

Next, I will examine the **methodology** and **experiments** sections, as these often contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the research. I will look for any references to datasets that the authors might have utilized for testing or validation purposes.

In the **experiments section**, if the authors describe their evaluation process, they may mention specific datasets. I will pay attention to any tables or figures that might summarize the datasets used, as these can provide concise information.

After identifying potential datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

If the paper does not explicitly mention datasets, I will look for any supplementary materials or appendices that might provide additional context or references to datasets used in the research.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citation for each dataset as per academic standards.

Finally, I will summarize my findings, clearly listing each dataset along with its citation, ready for further processing or review.
