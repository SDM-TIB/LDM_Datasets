To extract datasets from the research paper titled "RAND-WALK: A latent variable model approach to word embeddings" by Sanjeev Arora et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention any datasets used for validation or experimentation. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets.

Next, I will look for specific sections that discuss datasets directly, such as a section titled **Datasets** or **Experiments**. In this paper, the authors may describe the datasets they used for training and testing their model. I will pay close attention to any details regarding the datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

If the datasets are not explicitly listed in a dedicated section, I will check the **experiments** section, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. I will note any mentions of datasets, including their purpose in the study.

Once I identify the datasets, I will consult the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial, as proper attribution is necessary for academic integrity. I will ensure that I capture the authors, title, publication venue, and year for each dataset.

For example, if the authors mention using a dataset like the **Penn Action Dataset**, I will look for its citation in the references. If the citation is not directly provided, I may need to search for it in external sources or databases to ensure accuracy.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the datasets into a structured format, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets referenced in the paper, maintaining a focus on clarity and proper citation practices.
