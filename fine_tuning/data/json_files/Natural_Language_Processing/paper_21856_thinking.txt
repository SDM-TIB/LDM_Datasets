To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Word Embedding with Better Distance Weighting and Window Size Scheduling" by Chaohao Yang, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the methods proposed but does not explicitly mention any datasets.

Next, I will move to the **introduction** section. Here, the focus is on the importance of word embeddings and the limitations of existing models, but again, no datasets are specified.

I will then check the **experiments section** (section 4), particularly **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the author explicitly lists the datasets used for training. The paper mentions two corpora constructed from English Wikipedia:

1. **enwik9**: This dataset contains the first 109 bytes of English Wikipedia, resulting in approximately 120 million words after processing.
2. **text8**: This dataset consists of the first 108 bytes of the preprocessed enwik9, containing about 17 million words.

Both datasets are used for training the proposed methods, and the author notes that they discard words appearing fewer than five times to focus on more valuable words.

Next, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The paper does not provide specific citations for the datasets, but it does mention that the datasets and the text preprocessing script can be found at a URL: http://mattmahoney.net/dc/textdata.html. This URL serves as the source for both datasets.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset names, descriptions, and the citation for the source URL.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for review or further processing.
