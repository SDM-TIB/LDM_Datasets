To extract datasets from the research paper titled "D-Aug: Enhancing Data Augmentation for Dynamic LiDAR Scenes" by Jiaxing Zhao, Peng Zheng, and Rui Ma, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors validated their method using the **nuScenes dataset**, which is a strong indication that this dataset is central to their research.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **introduction**. The authors discuss the challenges of creating large LiDAR datasets and the importance of data augmentation, but they specifically highlight the **nuScenes dataset** as the dataset used for validation.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide details about the **nuScenes dataset**, stating that it comprises 1,000 driving sequences with specific allocations for training, validation, and testing. This section confirms that the nuScenes dataset is the primary dataset utilized in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the nuScenes dataset. The citation provided in the references is:

- For **nuScenes dataset**:
  > H. Caesar, V. Bankiti, A. H. Lang, S. Vora, V. E. Liong, Q. Xu, A. Krishnan, Y. Pan, G. Baldan, and O. Beijbom. *nuScenes: A multimodal dataset for autonomous driving*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 11621â€“11631, 2020.

Having identified the dataset and its citation, I will now prepare to create an entry for the nuScenes dataset using the required format.

In summary, the steps I followed were:
1. Read the abstract and introduction to identify mentions of datasets.
2. Confirm the dataset in the experiments section.
3. Retrieve the full citation from the references.

This structured approach ensures that I accurately extract and cite the dataset used in the research paper.
