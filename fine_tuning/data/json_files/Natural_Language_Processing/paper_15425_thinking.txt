To extract datasets from the research paper titled "GROOViST: A Metric for Grounding Objects in Visual Storytelling" by Aditya K Surikuchi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, and the introduction often outlines the datasets used in the context of the study.

In the **introduction**, the authors reference the **Visual Storytelling Dataset (VIST)**, which is a collection of English stories created based on sequences of images. This dataset is crucial for the experiments conducted in the paper.

Next, I will look for any additional datasets mentioned in the **analyses of existing metrics** section. Here, the authors discuss the **Flickr30K Entities dataset**, which is used to pre-train the RoViST-VG model. This dataset is relevant for understanding the grounding metrics discussed in the paper.

The authors also analyze scores from three visual storytelling datasets in the **grounding in visual storytelling datasets** section:
1. **VIST** (Huang et al., 2016) - This dataset comprises sequences of five natural images and corresponding five-sentence stories.
2. **AESOP** (Ravi et al., 2021) - This dataset includes sequences of three synthetic images and corresponding three-paragraph long stories.
3. **VWP** (Hong et al., 2023) - This dataset consists of sequences of movie shots, each including 5-10 images with corresponding sentences that make up their stories.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset from the **References section** of the paper:

1. For **VIST**, the citation is:

2. For **Flickr30K Entities**, the citation is:

3. For **AESOP**, the citation is:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its full citation for clarity and proper attribution. This structured approach will help ensure that all relevant datasets are documented comprehensively.
