To extract the datasets mentioned in the paper titled "Towards Real-World Streaming Speech Translation for Code-Switched Speech" by Belen Alastruey et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and datasets sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions extending the Fisher and Miami datasets, which indicates that these datasets are central to the research. 

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of code-switching in speech translation and highlight the need for datasets that support translation to a third language. This reinforces the importance of the datasets mentioned.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Datasets)**, where the authors provide a detailed summary of the datasets used in their research. They mention several datasets, including:

1. **Fisher Dataset**: This dataset is described as being collected for automatic speech recognition (ASR) and contains a significant amount of code-switched utterances. The authors specify that it was recorded through phone calls in 2004.

2. **Bangor Miami Dataset**: This dataset consists of recorded conversations between bilingual English/Spanish speakers, with a high proportion of naturally occurring code-switched speech.

3. **CoVoST Dataset**: A multilingual and diversified speech translation dataset based on the Common Voice project, which includes various language pairs.

4. **MuST-C Dataset**: A large-scale dataset for speech translation research, containing speech recordings from English TED Talks and their corresponding human transcriptions and translations.

In the **data collection section**, the authors elaborate on how they extended the Fisher and Miami datasets to include new targets in Spanish and German. This is crucial for understanding the modifications made to these datasets.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

- For the **Fisher Dataset**, the citation is:

- For the **MuST-C Dataset**, the citation is:

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all details are accurately represented for further processing or review.
