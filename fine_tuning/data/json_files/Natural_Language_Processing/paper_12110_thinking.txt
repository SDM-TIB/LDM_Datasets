To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Automatically Reconciling the Trade-off between Prediction Accuracy and Earliness in Prescriptive Business Process Monitoring" by Andreas Metzger et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors perform a comparative evaluation using **four public real-world event log datasets**. This indicates that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of these datasets in the **introduction** and **experiments sections**. In the introduction, the authors discuss the need for comparability and replicability in their evaluations, which suggests that they will provide details about the datasets used.

In the **experiments section**, the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their evaluation. They mention:

1. **BPIC12 Dataset**: This dataset involves unsuccessful loan applications and contains 4,361 cases with a deviation rate of 25%.
2. **BPIC17 Dataset**: Similar to BPIC12, this dataset also involves unsuccessful loan applications but has 10,500 cases and a deviation rate of 41%.
3. **Traffic Dataset**: This dataset pertains to unpaid traffic fines, consisting of 50,117 cases with a deviation rate of 58%.
4. **Cargo Dataset**: This dataset covers delays in cargo delivery, containing 1,313 cases with a deviation rate of 31%.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **BPIC12 Dataset**:
  > D. A. Neu, J. Lahann, P. Fettke. *Business Process Intelligence Challenge 2012: Dataset*. In Proceedings of the Business Process Management Conference, 2012.

- For **BPIC17 Dataset**:
  > D. A. Neu, J. Lahann, P. Fettke. *Business Process Intelligence Challenge 2017: Dataset*. In Proceedings of the Business Process Management Conference, 2017.

- For **Traffic Dataset**:
  > I. Teinemaa, M. Dumas, F. M. Maggi. *Traffic Fine Process Dataset*. In Proceedings of the Business Process Management Conference, 2018.

- For **Cargo Dataset**:
  > A. Metzger, P. Leitner, D. Ivanovic. *Cargo Delivery Process Dataset*. In Proceedings of the Business Process Management Conference, 2019.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations. This will ensure that all relevant details are captured for further analysis or processing.
