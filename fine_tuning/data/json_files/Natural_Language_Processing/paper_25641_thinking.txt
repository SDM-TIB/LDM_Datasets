To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Construction and Hedging of Equity Index Options Portfolios" by Maciej Wysocki and Robert Slepaczuk, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study employs **1-minute data of S&P500 index options and index quotes spanning from 2018 to 2023**. This suggests that there is a dataset related to S&P500 options.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for further details about the datasets. The introduction discusses the significance of options portfolios and mentions the use of algorithmic investment strategies, but it does not provide specific dataset names.

I will then look into **section 3 (Data)**, which is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets used in the study. Here, the authors specify that they utilized **1-minute quotes of the S&P500 Index and the corresponding quotes of S&P500 European index options from the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE)**. This section confirms the dataset's focus on S&P500 options and provides a timeframe for the data.

In addition, the authors mention that they relied on **daily quotes of the VIX index from CBOE** and the **U.S. 3-Month Treasury Bill rate** as a proxy for the risk-free rate. These are also important datasets relevant to the study.

Now, I will compile the full citations for these datasets from the **References section** of the paper:

1. **S&P500 Index Options Dataset**:
   - Citation: The dataset is derived from the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) and does not have a specific citation in the references, but it is commonly referenced in financial literature.

2. **VIX Index Dataset**:
   - Citation: The VIX index data is also sourced from the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE), similar to the S&P500 options dataset.

3. **U.S. 3-Month Treasury Bill Rate**:
   - Citation: This data is typically available from the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) but is not specifically cited in the paper.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

- **Dataset 1**: S&P500 Index Options (1-minute data from CBOE, 2018-2023)
- **Dataset 2**: VIX Index (daily quotes from CBOE)
- **Dataset 3**: U.S. 3-Month Treasury Bill Rate (source: FRED)

Finally, I will ensure that I format the dataset entries clearly and accurately for any downstream processing or review.
