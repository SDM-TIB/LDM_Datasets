To extract datasets from the research paper titled "VINECS: Video-based Neural Character Skinning" by Zhouyingcheng Liao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention that their method is evaluated on data collected from multi-view videos of human actors. However, they do not specify any dataset names yet.

Next, I will look into the **methodology section** where the authors describe their data preparation process. Here, they mention that they recorded multi-view videos of human subjects, specifically referring to the **DynaCap dataset**. This dataset is crucial for their experiments, as it contains synchronized and calibrated multi-view RGB videos of human characters in motion.

In the **results section**, the authors provide further details about the subjects used in their experiments. They specifically mention two subjects from the DynaCap dataset, referred to as **D2** and **D5**, and describe the number of cameras and frames involved in the recordings. They also introduce a new subject, **V6**, captured using their own setup.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the DynaCap dataset. The citation is typically formatted in a standard way, and I will ensure to include all necessary details such as authors, title, publication venue, and year.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citation for the DynaCap dataset as follows:

- **DynaCap Dataset**: This dataset includes multi-view video recordings of human actors in various articulated poses. The specific subjects used in the experiments are D2, D5, and V6, with D2 and D5 being from the DynaCap dataset.

The full citation for the DynaCap dataset is:
> Marc Habermann, Lingjie Liu, Weipeng Xu, Michael Zollhoefer, Gerard Pons-Moll, and Christian Theobalt. *DynaCap: Monocular Human Performance Capture Using Weak Supervision*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 1-10, 2020.

Finally, I will summarize the findings in a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its citation, ready for further processing or review.
