To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Neural Collapse Versus Low-Rank Bias: Is Deep Neural Collapse Really Optimal?" by Peter Súkeník et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and the introduction often discusses the context and datasets used in the research.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, which typically contains detailed descriptions of the datasets used for evaluation. In this paper, the authors mention conducting experiments on standard datasets such as **MNIST** and **CIFAR-10**. I will look for specific details about these datasets, such as their size, characteristics, and any preprocessing steps mentioned.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets themselves.

For the **MNIST dataset**, I will find the citation:
> Yann LeCun, Léon Bottou, Yoshua Bengio, and Patrick Haffner. *Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition*. Proceedings of the IEEE, 86(11), 1998.

For the **CIFAR-10 dataset**, the citation is:
> Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. Technical report, University of Toronto, 2009.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset entry includes its name, description, and full citation.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for output, ensuring that they are clear and ready for any further processing or review.
