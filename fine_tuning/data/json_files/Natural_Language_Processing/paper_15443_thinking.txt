To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Exploring Multi-level Prompt Tuning for Machine Reading Comprehension" by Guoxin Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract states that the authors conducted experiments on **12 benchmarks of various QA formats**, which suggests that multiple datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets and Baselines)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention the following datasets:

1. **SQuAD2**: This dataset is used for extractive question answering and contains 118,446 training examples. The authors note that it requires token overlap for evaluation.

2. **NewsQA**: Another extractive QA dataset with 72,219 training examples, evaluated using the ROUGE-L metric.

3. **NarrativeQA (NarQA)**: An abstractive QA dataset with 65,494 training examples, also evaluated using ROUGE-L.

4. **DROP**: This dataset has 67,864 training examples and requires discrete reasoning for evaluation.

5. **MCTest**: A multiple-choice QA dataset with 1,480 training examples.

6. **ARC (easy and challenge)**: Two datasets with 2,250 and 1,119 training examples, respectively, used for multiple-choice questions.

7. **OpenBookQA (OBQA)**: A multiple-choice QA dataset with 4,957 training examples.

8. **QASC**: Another multiple-choice dataset with 7,208 training examples.

9. **RACE**: This dataset has 25,421 training examples and is used for multiple-choice questions.

10. **BoolQ**: A yes/no QA dataset with 6,157 training examples.

11. **BoolQ-NP**: A variant of BoolQ with 9,727 training examples.

I will then look for the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are typically provided in the format of the original papers or sources from which these datasets were derived. 

For example, I will find the following citations:

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries with their full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented and properly cited for future reference.
