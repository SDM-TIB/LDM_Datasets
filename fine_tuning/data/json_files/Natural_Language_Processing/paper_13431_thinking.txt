To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Generalizable Neural Solvers for Vehicle Routing Problems via Ensemble with Transferrable Local Policy" by Chengrui Gao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the datasets referenced. In the abstract, the authors mention evaluating their method on two well-known benchmarks: **TSPLIB** and **CVRPLIB**. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for their experiments.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (section 4) to find detailed descriptions of the datasets used. In section 4.1, the authors explicitly state that they conduct experiments on the **Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP)** and **Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP)**, and they specify that they use the **TSPLIB** and **CVRPLIB** benchmarks for their evaluations. 

In the **background section** (section 2), the authors provide further context about the Vehicle Routing Problems (VRPs) and mention the significance of these datasets in the context of their research. 

Now, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for the datasets:

1. **TSPLIB**: The citation is:
   > Reinelt, G. (1991). TSPLIB - A traveling salesman problem library. *ORSA Journal on Computing*, 3(4), 376–384.

2. **CVRPLIB**: The citation is:
   > Uchoa, E., Pecin, D., Pessoa, A., Poggi, M., Vidal, T., & Subramanian, A. (2017). New benchmark instances for the capacitated vehicle routing problem. *European Journal of Operational Research*, 257(3), 845–858.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its full citation, as this is crucial for proper attribution and further research.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring that they are ready for review or downstream processing.
