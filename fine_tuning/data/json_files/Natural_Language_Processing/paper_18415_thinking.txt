To extract datasets from the research paper titled "To Burst or Not to Burst: Generating and Quantifying Improbable Text" by Kuleen Sasse et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract mentions evaluating metrics across various datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used in their experiments. In this section, they mention six datasets:

1. **arXiv**: This dataset is referenced as a source of academic papers.
2. **CNN/Daily Mail**: This dataset is commonly used for text summarization tasks.
3. **Gutenberg**: This dataset consists of literary works from Project Gutenberg.
4. **Stack Exchange**: This dataset includes questions and answers from the Stack Exchange platform.
5. **Twitter**: This dataset consists of tweets, which are often used for sentiment analysis and other NLP tasks.
6. **Wikipedia**: This dataset includes articles from Wikipedia, a widely used resource for various NLP tasks.

I will then look for the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

After gathering the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation.

Now, I will summarize the findings for each dataset:

1. **arXiv**: 
   - Description: A dataset of academic papers.
   - Citation: Clement, C. B., Bierbaum, M., Oâ€™Keeffe, K. P., & Alemi, A. A. (2019). On the use of arxiv as a dataset.

2. **CNN/Daily Mail**: 
   - Description: A dataset used for text summarization, containing news articles and their summaries.
   - Citation: Nallapati, R., Zhou, B., Santos, C. D., & Xiang, B. (2016). Abstractive text summarization using sequence-to-sequence RNNs and beyond.

3. **Gutenberg**: 
   - Description: A dataset of literary works from Project Gutenberg.
   - Citation: Rae, J. W., Potapenko, A., Jayakumar, S. M., Hillier, C., & Lillicrap, T. P. (2020). Compressive transformers for long-range sequence modelling.

4. **Stack Exchange**: 
   - Description: A dataset of questions and answers from the Stack Exchange platform.
   - Citation: Gao, L., Biderman, S., Black, S., Golding, L., Hoppe, T., Foster, C., Phang, J., & Leahy, C. (2020). The Pile: An 800GB dataset of diverse text for language modeling.

5. **Twitter**: 
   - Description: A dataset of tweets used for various NLP tasks.
   - Citation: Rosenthal, S., Farra, N., & Nakov, P. (2017). SemEval-2017 task 4: Sentiment analysis in Twitter.

6. **Wikipedia**: 
   - Description: A dataset of articles from Wikipedia.
   - Citation: Wikimedia Foundation. Wikimedia downloads.

Finally, I will ensure that I have accurately captured the details and citations for each dataset, ready for further processing or review.
