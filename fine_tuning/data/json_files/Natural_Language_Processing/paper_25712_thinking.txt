To extract datasets from the research paper titled "EAFormer: Scene Text Segmentation with Edge-Aware Transformers" by Haiyang Yu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments on commonly-used benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention six text segmentation benchmarks:

1. **ICDAR13 FST**: This dataset is referenced as a widely-used benchmark for scene text segmentation.
2. **COCO_TS**: The authors note that they have re-annotated this dataset due to the original annotations being inaccurate.
3. **MLT_S**: Similar to COCO_TS, this dataset has also been re-annotated for better evaluation.
4. **Total-Text**: Another benchmark mentioned for scene text segmentation.
5. **TextSeg**: This dataset is highlighted for its fine-grained annotations.
6. **BTS**: A bilingual text segmentation dataset that includes both Chinese and English texts.

In the same section, the authors provide statistical details about each dataset, including the number of images, train/test/validation splits, and the number of classes.

Now, I will refer to the **References section** to gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

- For **ICDAR13 FST**, the citation is:

In Proceedings of the 2013 12th International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition, pages 1484–1493, 2013.

- For **COCO_TS**, the citation is:

- For **TextSeg**, the citation is:
  > Xu, X., Zhang, Z., Wang, Z., Price, B., Wang, Z., Shi, H. *Rethinking text segmentation: A novel dataset and a text-specific refinement approach*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 12045–12055, 2021.

- For **BTS**, the citation is:

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its full citation for clarity and completeness.
