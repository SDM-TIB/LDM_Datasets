To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MIKE: A New Benchmark for Fine-grained Multimodal Entity Knowledge Editing" by Jiaqi Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract introduces MIKE as a benchmark and dataset for fine-grained multimodal entity knowledge editing, indicating that a dataset is indeed present.

Next, I will look for specific sections that detail the datasets used, particularly focusing on **section 3 (MIKE Benchmark)**, where the authors describe the construction of the dataset. Here, they mention that MIKE consists of more than 1000 fine-grained entities, each with at least 5 images. This section will likely provide the necessary details about the dataset.

In **section 3.1 (Collecting FG Entity Images)**, the authors explain the process of collecting images for the dataset, specifically noting that they selected 1500 fine-grained entities from the OVEN dataset. This indicates that the OVEN dataset is a source for their dataset.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the OVEN dataset, which is crucial for proper attribution. The citation for the OVEN dataset is:
> Hu, H., et al. (2023). *Open-domain visual entity recognition: Towards recognizing millions of Wikipedia entities*. CoRR, abs/2302.11154.

Additionally, I will ensure to note any other datasets mentioned throughout the paper, particularly in the context of the tasks designed to evaluate the MIKE benchmark. For instance, the authors reference the NQ Dataset in section 3.2, which is used for evaluating text locality. The citation for the NQ Dataset is:
> Kwiatkowski, T., et al. (2019). *Natural questions: a benchmark for question answering research*. Trans. Assoc. Comput. Linguistics, 7:452â€“466.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described accurately and includes its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets referenced in the paper.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring that all necessary details are included for each dataset identified in the research paper.
