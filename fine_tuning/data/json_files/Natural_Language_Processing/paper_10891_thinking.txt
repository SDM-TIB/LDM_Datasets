To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Enhancing Translation for Indigenous Languages: Experiments with Multilingual Models" by Atnafu Lambebo Tonja et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and the section titled "Languages and Datasets"** to locate any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the paper discusses machine translation systems for indigenous languages, which suggests that datasets related to these languages will be present.

In the **"Languages and Datasets" section**, the authors provide a detailed table (Table 1) that lists various indigenous languages along with their ISO codes, language families, and the number of parallel sentences in training, development, and test sets. This section is crucial as it directly outlines the datasets used in their experiments.

Next, I will extract the specific datasets mentioned for each language. The paper describes the sources of data for each language, which is essential for providing full citations. Here are the datasets identified:

1. **Aymara-Spanish Dataset**: The data comes from the Global Voices. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Jörg Tiedemann. 2012. Parallel data, tools and interfaces in OPUS. In Proceedings of the Eighth International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC’12), pages 2214–2218, Istanbul, Turkey. European Language Resources Association (ELRA).

2. **Bribri-Spanish Dataset**: The data is sourced from six different documents. The citation is:
   > Isaac Feldman and Rolando Coto-Solano. 2020. Neural machine translation models with back-translation for the extremely low-resource indigenous language bribri. In Proceedings of the 28th International Conference on Computational Linguistics, pages 3965–3976.

3. **Asháninka-Spanish Dataset**: This dataset is derived from three sources. The citations are:
   > Rubén Cushimariano Romano and Richer C. Sebastián Q. 2008. Ñaantsipeta asháninkaki birakochaki. diccionario asháninka-castellano. versión preliminar.  
   > John E Ortega, Richard Castro Mamani, and Kyunghyun Cho. 2020a. Neural machine translation with a polysynthetic low resource language. Machine Translation, 34(4):325–346.  
   > Elena Mihas. 2011. Añaani katonkosatzi parenini, El idioma del alto Perené. Milwaukee, WI: Clarks Graphics.

4. **Chatino-Spanish Dataset**: The parallel data can be accessed online. The citation is:
   > Emiliana Cruz and Anthony C Woodbury. 2006. The sandhi of tones in the chatino de quiahije. In Memoirs of the Congress of Indigenous Languages of Latin America.

5. **Guarani-Spanish Dataset**: The citation for this dataset is:
   > A Scott Britton. 2005. Guaraní-english/english-guaraní: Concise dictionary. New York: Hippocrene.

6. **Wixarika-Spanish Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Diario Oficial de la Federación. 2003. Ley general de derechos lingüísticos de los pueblos indígenas. Dirección General de Bibliotecas.

7. **Nahuatl-Spanish Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Jörg Tiedemann. 2020. The tatoeba translation challenge – realistic data sets for low resource and multilingual MT. In Proceedings of the Fifth Conference on Machine Translation, pages 1174–1182.

8. **Hñähñu-Spanish Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Y. Lastra. 2001. Chapter 6. Otomí Language Shift and Some Recent Efforts to Reverse It, pages 142–165. Multilingual Matters, Bristol, Blue Ridge Summit.

9. **Quechua-Spanish Dataset**: The citations are:
   > Željko Agić and Ivan Vulic. 2019. JW300: A wide-coverage parallel corpus for low-resource languages. In Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, pages 3204–3210, Florence, Italy.  
   > Jörg Tiedemann. 2012. Parallel data, tools and interfaces in OPUS. In Proceedings of the Eighth International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC’12), pages 2214–2218.

10. **Shipibo-Konibo-Spanish Dataset**: The citations are:
    > Héctor Erasmo Gómez Montoya, Kervy Dante Rivas Rojas, and Arturo Oncevay. 2019. A continuous improvement framework of machine translation for Shipibo-konibo. In Proceedings of the 2nd Workshop on Technologies for MT of Low Resource Languages, pages 17–23.  
    > Ana-Paula Galarreta, Andrés Melgar, and Arturo Oncevay. 2017. Corpus creation and initial SMT experiments between Spanish and Shipibo-konibo. In Proceedings of the International Conference Recent Advances in Natural Language Processing, RANLP 2017, pages 238–244, Varna, Bulgaria.

11. **Rarámuri-Spanish Dataset**: The citation is:
    > Gabriela Caballero. 2017. Choguita rarámuri (tarahumara) language description and documentation: a guide to the deposited collection and associated materials. language documentation and conservation.

After gathering all this information, I will ensure that I have the full citations for each dataset, as they are crucial for proper referencing. Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
