To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Tightening Bounds on Probabilities of Causation By Merging Datasets" by Numair Sani and Atalanti A. Mastakouri, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the challenges of point identification of probabilities of causation and hints at the use of multiple datasets, which suggests that datasets may be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology and results sections**. These sections often contain specific references to datasets used in experiments or analyses. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, characteristics, and the context in which they are used.

In the **experiments section**, I will pay close attention to any subsections that discuss the datasets used for evaluation. If the authors mention specific datasets, I will note their names and any relevant details provided, such as the number of samples, types of variables, or any unique features.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to ensure that the datasets can be accessed or referenced correctly in future work.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like the "XYZ Dataset," I will look for its citation in the references. If the dataset is not directly cited, I will note the authors and title of the original work where the dataset was introduced or described.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset entry includes:
1. The name of the dataset.
2. A brief description of the dataset, including its purpose and any relevant characteristics.
3. The full citation for the dataset as found in the references.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets referenced in the paper, maintaining a focus on clarity and proper citation.
