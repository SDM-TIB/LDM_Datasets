To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Collective Innovation in Groups of Large Language Models" by Eleni Nisioti et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in a creative video game called **Little Alchemy 2**, which suggests that this game may serve as a dataset or test-bed for the research.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **methodology section**. The authors describe their test-bed as an extension of **Wordcraft**, a Python-based gym environment inspired by Little Alchemy 2. This indicates that both Little Alchemy 2 and Wordcraft are integral to their research.

In the **results section**, the authors discuss the performance of LLMs in various tasks, but they do not explicitly mention additional datasets. However, they reference the knowledge graph from Little Alchemy 2, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's structure.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The key datasets identified are:

1. **Little Alchemy 2**: This game serves as a test-bed for studying collective innovation. The citation for this game is:
   > Little Alchemy 2. (n.d.). Retrieved from https://littlealchemy2.com

2. **Wordcraft**: This is a Python-based gym environment used for benchmarking commonsense agents. The citation for this environment is:
   > Jiang, M., Luketina, J., Nardelli, N., Minervini, P., Torr, P. H. S., Whiteson, S., & RocktÂ¨aschel, T. (2020). *WordCraft: An Environment for Benchmarking Commonsense Agents*. arXiv:2007.09185 [cs].

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
