To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning High-Order Relationships of Brain Regions" by Weikang Qiu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their methods on two datasets: **ABIDE** and **ABCD**. This is a good starting point.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 5), where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used. Here, they mention:

1. **Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE)**: This dataset includes resting-state fMRI data from patients across 17 international sites, along with anatomical and phenotypic data. The authors specify that they use the preprocessed version from the official website and provide details about the regions obtained using the Craddock 200 atlas.

2. **Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD)**: This dataset is described as one of the largest public fMRI datasets, involving data from 11,875 children aged 9 to 10 years. The authors mention that access to this dataset is restricted and requires adherence to a rigorous data request procedure. They also specify that they use imaging data collected from baseline and a 2-year follow-up.

In the **dataset details section (D.2)**, the authors provide statistics about the number of instances and the length of time series for both datasets, confirming their relevance for the study.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **ABIDE dataset**, the citation is:
  > Craddock, C., Benhajali, Y., Chu, C., Chouinard, F., Evans, A., Jakab, A., Khundrakpam, B. S., Lewis, J. D., Li, Q., Milham, M., et al. *The neuro bureau preprocessing initiative: open sharing of preprocessed neuroimaging data and derivatives*. Frontiers in Neuroinformatics, 7(27):5, 2013.

- For the **ABCD dataset**, the citation is:
  > Casey, B. J., Cannonier, T., Conley, M. I., Cohen, A. O., Barch, D. M., Heitzeg, M. M., Soules, M. E., Teslovich, T., Dellarco, D. V., Garavan, H., et al. *The adolescent brain cognitive development (ABCD) study: Imaging acquisition across 21 sites*. Developmental cognitive neuroscience, 32:43â€“54, 2018.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes the full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
