To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Cross-Domain Continual Learning" by Marcus de Carvalho et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on public UDA datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors mention five popular UDA benchmarks in the **experiments section**:

1. **VisDA-2017**: This dataset consists of synthetic 2D renderings of 3D models and photo-realistic images, with 12 classes split into 4 tasks of 3 classes each.

2. **Office-31**: Contains 31 object categories across three domains: Amazon, DSLR, and Webcam. The dataset is structured into 30 classes divided into 5 tasks of 6 classes each.

3. **Office-Home**: This dataset consists of 65 categories across four domains: Art, Clipart, Product, and Real-World, divided into 13 tasks of 5 classes each.

4. **DomainNet**: Contains 345 classes represented in six domains: Clipart, Infographics, Painting, Quickdraw, Real, and Sketch, divided into 15 tasks of 23 classes each.

5. **MNIST↔USPS**: This dataset includes gray-scale images of handwritten digits, with 10 classes split into 5 tasks of 2 classes each.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
