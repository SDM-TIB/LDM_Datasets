To extract datasets from the research paper titled "FD-Vision Mamba for Endoscopic Exposure Correction" by Zhuoran Zheng and Jun Zhang, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the development of a network for endoscopic image exposure correction, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention challenges in endoscopic imaging but do not specify any datasets. I will proceed to the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations.

In **section 3 (Experiments)**, the authors introduce a novel dataset called **E-kvasir**. They describe it as a synthetic endoscopic image HDR dataset comprising 900 pairs of under-/over-exposed images along with their corresponding normally-exposed counterparts. This section provides crucial details about the dataset's composition and purpose.

Next, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the E-kvasir dataset. The authors reference the original source of the dataset as follows:

- For **E-kvasir**, the citation is:
  > Pogorelov, K., Randel, K.R., Griwodz, C., Eskeland, S.L., de Lange, T., Johansen, D., Spampinato, C., Dang-Nguyen, D.T., Lux, M., Schmidt, P.T., Riegler, M., Halvorsen, P. *Kvasir: A multi-class image dataset for computer aided gastrointestinal disease detection*. In Proceedings of the 8th ACM on Multimedia Systems Conference, 2017.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the findings:

1. **E-kvasir**: A synthetic endoscopic image HDR dataset with 900 pairs of images (under-/over-exposed and normally-exposed).

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that the full citation is included for the dataset.
