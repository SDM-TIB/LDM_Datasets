To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Interpretable User Satisfaction Estimation for Conversational Systems with Large Language Models" by Ying-Chun Lin et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses user satisfaction estimation in conversational systems, which suggests that datasets related to user interactions may be involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this paper, they mention using four datasets for their experiments: **Bing Copilot**, **MWOZ**, **SGD**, and **ReDial**. I will note down the details provided for each dataset.

1. **Bing Copilot**: The paper states that this dataset includes 50,000 fully de-identified conversations. This dataset is significant as it represents a general-purpose conversational system.

2. **MWOZ (MultiWOZ)**: This dataset consists of 1,155 conversations and is used for task-oriented dialogue systems. The authors reference a specific paper for the dataset's details.

3. **SGD (Schema-Guided Dialogue)**: This dataset contains 1,638 conversations and is also used for task-oriented dialogue systems. The authors provide a citation for this dataset as well.

4. **ReDial**: This dataset includes 1,387 conversations and is another task-oriented dataset. The authors mention that user satisfaction labels for this dataset were provided by a specific study.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
