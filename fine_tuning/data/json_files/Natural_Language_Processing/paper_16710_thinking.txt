To extract datasets from the research paper titled "RJHMC-Tree for Exploration of the Bayesian Decision Tree Posterior" by Jodie A. Cochrane et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the proposed method is tested against **standard datasets in the machine learning and Bayesian decision tree literature**, which indicates that specific datasets will be discussed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for testing their methods. In this section, they mention testing their method on both **synthetic and real-world datasets**. They specifically refer to the following datasets:

1. **Synthetic Dataset**: This dataset is adapted from the work of Chipman et al. (1998) and is used to validate the proposed method. The authors provide details about the structure and characteristics of this dataset.

2. **Real-World Datasets**: The authors list several datasets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository:
   - **Iris Dataset**
   - **Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Original) Dataset**
   - **Wine Dataset**
   - **Raisin Dataset**

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide performance metrics for each dataset, which further confirms their usage in the study.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

With these citations in hand, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
