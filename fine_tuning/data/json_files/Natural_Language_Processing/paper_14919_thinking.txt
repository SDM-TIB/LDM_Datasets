To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Incentive Mechanism Design for Distributed Ensemble Learning" by Chao Huang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of the **MNIST dataset** for numerical experiments, which indicates that this dataset is relevant to the study.

Next, I will check the **introduction** for any additional context or datasets. The introduction primarily discusses the concept of distributed ensemble learning and does not introduce new datasets.

In the **experimental results section (Section IV)**, the authors explicitly mention using the **MNIST dataset** for their numerical experiments. They describe the dataset as containing 70,000 images of handwritten digits, with 60,000 for training and 10,000 for testing. This confirms that the MNIST dataset is the primary dataset used in their experiments.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citation for the MNIST dataset. The paper cites the MNIST dataset as follows:

- **MNIST Dataset**: 
  > "MNIST dataset." Available at: https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/mnist.

Since the citation is a URL, I will ensure to format it correctly in the final output.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry for the MNIST dataset, ensuring to include the full citation as required.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry in the specified format, ready for review or further processing.
