To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Practical Tool Usage for Continually Learning LLMs" by Jerry Huang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will look for any mention of datasets or benchmarks that the authors used in their experiments. 

In the **introduction**, I will pay attention to any references to datasets or benchmarks that are critical to the research. The authors may describe the context in which they are working, which could lead to the identification of specific datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly any subsections that discuss datasets or experimental setups. This section often contains detailed descriptions of the datasets used, including their characteristics, sizes, and purposes. 

In this paper, the authors mention constructing a **synthetic arithmetic dataset** with Easy and Difficult splits, which is a clear indication of a dataset being used. I will note the details provided about this dataset, such as its structure and the number of examples.

Additionally, the authors refer to using a subset of tasks from the **GLUE benchmark** (Wang et al., 2019a), which is another dataset that I need to document. I will look for specific tasks mentioned, such as MNLI, QQP, SST-2, and CoLA, and gather any relevant details about how these tasks are utilized in their experiments.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets themselves.

For the **synthetic arithmetic dataset**, I will note that it is a custom dataset created by the authors, and I will describe its characteristics based on the information provided in the paper. 

For the **GLUE benchmark**, I will include the citation for the original paper that introduced this benchmark, which is essential for acknowledging the source of the dataset.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant datasets mentioned in the paper while providing proper citations for each.
