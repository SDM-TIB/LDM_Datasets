To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Integrating Visual and Semantic Similarity Using Hierarchies for Image Retrieval" by Aishwarya Venkataramanan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions experiments conducted on "standard datasets: CUB-200-2011 and CIFAR100," which indicates that these datasets are crucial for the research. The introduction further emphasizes the importance of these datasets in the context of content-based image retrieval.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (section 4) to gather detailed descriptions of the datasets used. In **section 4.2 (Experimental Setup)**, the authors provide specific information about the datasets:

1. **CUB-200-2011**: This dataset consists of 200 classes of birds with a total of 11,788 images. The training set contains 5,994 images, while the test set has 5,794 images.

2. **CIFAR100**: This dataset includes 60,000 images across 100 classes, with 50,000 images for training and 10,000 for testing.

3. **Diatom Dataset**: This dataset comprises 9,895 individual diatom images belonging to 166 classes.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **CUB-200-2011**, the citation is:
  > Wah, C., Branson, S., Welinder, P., Perona, P., & Belongie, S. (2011). *The Caltech-UCSD Birds-200-2011 Dataset*. 

- For **CIFAR100**, the citation is:
  > Krizhevsky, A., & Hinton, G. (2009). *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*.

- For the **Diatom Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Venkataramanan, A., Faure-Giovagnoli, P., Regan, C., Heudre, D., Figus, C., Usseglio-Polatera, P., Pradalier, C., & Laviale, M. (2023). *Usefulness of Synthetic Datasets for Diatom Automatic Detection Using a Deep-Learning Approach*. Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence, 117, 105594.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will prepare the information for any required structured output or further analysis.
