To extract datasets from the research paper titled "AI-Enabled Software and System Architecture Frameworks: Focusing on Smart Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs)" by Armin Moin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections. These sections often provide a summary of the research focus and may mention any datasets used in the study. In this case, the abstract discusses the need for architecture frameworks that include stakeholders with data science and machine learning concerns, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets.

Next, I will examine the **methodology section** (Section 4) where the authors describe their empirical study. This section typically details the research design and may include information about the data collected. I will look for any references to datasets used for the online survey or interviews conducted with subject matter experts. 

Upon reviewing Section 4, I find that the authors conducted a survey with 61 participants from various organizations, but they do not specify any datasets in the traditional sense (like image datasets or benchmark datasets). Instead, they mention the collection of demographic information and expert opinions, which does not constitute a dataset in the conventional sense.

I will also check the **data availability section** at the end of the paper. Here, the authors provide a link to supplementary material available on Zenodo, which may contain additional data or datasets related to their study. The link provided is: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.12532455. This is an important piece of information as it directs readers to where they can find the data associated with the research.

Finally, I will compile the findings regarding datasets, ensuring to include full citations where applicable. Since the paper does not reference traditional datasets but does provide a link to supplementary material, I will note this as the primary source of data related to the study.

The final entries for the datasets will be as follows:

1. **Supplementary Material**: This includes the data collected from the online survey and interviews conducted as part of the research study.
   - Citation: Moin, A., Badii, A., GÃ¼nnemann, S., & Challenger, M. (2023). *AI-Enabled Software and System Architecture Frameworks: Focusing on Smart Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs)*. Available at Zenodo: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.12532455.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for any further processing or review.
