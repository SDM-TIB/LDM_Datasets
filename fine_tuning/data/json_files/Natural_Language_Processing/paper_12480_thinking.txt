To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) in Aging Clock Models" by Alena Kalyakulina et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on XAI in aging research, which may hint at the types of datasets used.

Next, I will examine **section 3 (XAI in age prediction studies)**, as this section appears to detail various studies that utilize XAI methods for age estimation. I will look for specific mentions of datasets, including their names, descriptions, and any relevant details about their use in the studies.

As I read through this section, I will note any datasets that are explicitly named. For instance, the paper discusses various biological systems and the corresponding data types used for age estimation, such as:

1. **MRI Data for Brain Age Estimation**: This dataset is used to estimate brain age based on MRI scans, highlighting the importance of specific brain regions.
2. **EEG Data**: The paper mentions the use of EEG signals for age estimation, indicating that this dataset is relevant for understanding brain activity related to aging.
3. **Retinal Fundus Photographs**: This dataset is used for estimating retinal age, which is linked to various health conditions.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for the datasets used in the research.

For example, if the paper references a specific dataset like the **Penn Action Dataset**, I would look for its citation in the references, which might be formatted as follows:
> Wenzheng Zhang, Menglong Zhu, and Konstantinos G. Derpanis. *From Actemes to Action: A Strongly-Supervised Representation for Detailed Action Understanding*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 2248â€“2255, 2013.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, including their names, descriptions, and citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference.

In summary, my steps will be:
1. Read the abstract and introduction for initial insights on datasets.
2. Focus on section 3 for detailed mentions of datasets used in age prediction studies.
3. Collect full citations from the references for each identified dataset.
4. Organize the information for clarity and accuracy.

By following this methodical approach, I will ensure that I accurately extract and cite the datasets relevant to the research paper.
