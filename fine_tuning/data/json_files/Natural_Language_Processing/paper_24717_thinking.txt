To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Unsupervised Gaze Representation via Eye Mask Driven Information Bottleneck" by Yangzhou Jiang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experimental results on several gaze benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they mention five gaze datasets:

1. **Columbia Gaze**: This dataset consists of 5.8K images with five horizontal head poses from 56 subjects.
   
2. **MPIIFaceGaze**: This dataset contains 45K images from 15 subjects collected in front of laptops.

3. **EyeDiap**: This dataset includes video clips from 16 subjects and screen targets or 3D floating balls, with specific conditions for the experiments.

4. **Gaze360**: This dataset comprises 85K images from 238 subjects with a wide range of head poses and gaze directions.

5. **ETH-Xgaze**: This dataset contains 756K images in laboratory environments with large variations in head poses and gaze directions.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will facilitate further research and validation of the findings presented in the paper.
