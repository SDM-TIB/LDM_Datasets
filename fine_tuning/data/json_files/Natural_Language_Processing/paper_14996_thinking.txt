To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Is Certifying â„“p Robustness Still Worthwhile?" by Ravi Mangal et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract may provide a brief overview of the research focus, while the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the work, which may include references to datasets used in the study.

Next, I will examine the **methodology and experiments sections** of the paper. These sections typically detail the datasets used for training and evaluation, including any specific datasets that the authors have utilized for their experiments. I will look for explicit mentions of dataset names, descriptions, and any relevant statistics (e.g., number of samples, types of data).

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **results and discussion sections** to see if the authors provide further insights or comparisons involving the datasets. This may include performance metrics or qualitative assessments that reinforce the importance of the datasets in their research.

Finally, I will consult the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. It is crucial to ensure that I have the correct and complete citation for each dataset, as this will be important for proper attribution and further research.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, including their names, descriptions, and citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference and use in future work.

In summary, my step-by-step approach will involve:
1. Reading the abstract and introduction for initial mentions of datasets.
2. Examining the methodology and experiments sections for detailed descriptions of datasets used.
3. Checking the results and discussion sections for additional context or insights regarding the datasets.
4. Consulting the references section for complete citations of each dataset.
5. Compiling the information into a structured format for future reference.
