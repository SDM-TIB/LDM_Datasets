To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Progress in Privacy Protection: A Review of Privacy Preserving Techniques in Recommender Systems, Edge Computing, and Cloud Computing" by Syed Raza Bashir et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections discussing datasets or methodologies** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a general overview but may not specify datasets directly. The introduction may also hint at datasets used in the context of mobile crowdsourcing, edge computing, and recommender systems.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.2 (Benchmark Dataset Development)**, where the authors discuss the creation of a benchmark dataset. They mention potential sources for dataset compilation, including:

1. **Foursquare API**: This is a well-known source for location-based data, which includes check-ins, tips, and tags.
2. **NYC Restaurant Rich Dataset**: This dataset contains rich information about restaurants in New York City.
3. **Global-scale Check-in Dataset**: This dataset provides valuable data for understanding user behavior in location-based services.

The authors emphasize the importance of anonymizing user identities in these datasets, which is crucial for privacy preservation.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets or the papers that describe them. The citations for the datasets mentioned are as follows:

- For the **Foursquare API**, the citation is:
  > Foursquare. *Foursquare API Documentation*. Available at: https://foursquare.com/. Accessed on 01/20/2024.

- For the **NYC Restaurant Rich Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Danofer, A. *Foursquare NYC Restaurant Rich Dataset*. Available at: https://www.kaggle.com/danofer/foursquare-nyc-rest. Accessed on 01/20/2024.

- For the **Global-scale Check-in Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yang, D., Zhang, D., & Qu, B. *Participatory cultural mapping based on collective behavior data in location-based social networks*. ACM Transactions on Intelligent Systems and Technology (TIST), 7(3):1â€“23, 2016.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that highlights the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all relevant details are included for future reference or analysis.
