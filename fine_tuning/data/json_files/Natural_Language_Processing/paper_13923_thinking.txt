To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An Optimization Case Study for solving a Transport Robot Scheduling Problem on Quantum-Hybrid and Quantum-Inspired Hardware" by Dominik Leib et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, but it may not contain specific dataset names. The introduction often discusses the context and relevance of the research, which might include references to datasets used in previous studies or benchmarks.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly the **benchmark setup** and **instances** subsections. Here, the authors describe the problem instances used for their optimization benchmarks. They mention that they created **260 test instances** of the transport robot scheduling problem (TRSP), defined by various parameters such as the number of samples, photos, processing times, and gaps between photos. This indicates that the datasets are likely the sets of instances generated for the experiments.

In the **benchmark setup section**, the authors categorize the instances into two groups: **minor instances** and **major instances**, detailing the number of variables and the specific parameters for each instance. This section is crucial as it provides the necessary details about the datasets used in the experiments.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets or related works mentioned in the paper. The authors may reference previous studies or datasets that informed their work, which is essential for proper citation.

After gathering all relevant information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This will involve summarizing the key characteristics of each dataset, such as the number of instances, parameters, and any specific details that define them.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format, ready for review or further processing, ensuring that all citations are accurate and complete.
