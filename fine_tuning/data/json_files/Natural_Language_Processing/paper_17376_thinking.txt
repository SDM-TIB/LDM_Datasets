To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Optimized classification with neural ODEs via separability" by Antonio Álvarez-López, Rafael Orive-Illera, and Enrique Zuazua, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract does not explicitly mention any datasets, so I will proceed to the introduction.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the context of supervised learning and classification but do not specify any datasets. I will continue to the **mathematical setting** section, where they describe the dataset used for their analysis.

In **section 2 (Mathematical setting)**, the authors define two disjoint subsets of N points, R and B, sampled from the uniform distribution in the hypercube [0, 1]d. This indicates that the dataset consists of points generated from a specific distribution, but it does not provide a formal dataset name or citation.

Next, I will check the **experiments or results sections** to see if any specific datasets are used for validation or testing. However, the paper primarily focuses on theoretical results and does not mention any external datasets.

Since the paper does not reference any established datasets or provide citations for datasets, I will conclude that the authors created their own synthetic dataset based on the uniform distribution in [0, 1]d. Therefore, I will note that there are no external datasets to cite.

In summary, the paper does not provide any datasets with formal citations, as it relies on a synthetic dataset generated from a uniform distribution. I will document this finding accordingly.

Now, I will compile my findings into a structured format for clarity and future reference.
