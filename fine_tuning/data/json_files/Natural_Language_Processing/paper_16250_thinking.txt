To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Optimal Investment and Fair Sharing Rules of the Incentives for Renewable Energy Communities" by Awerkin, Falbo, and Vargiolu, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, which may hint at the datasets used. The introduction often discusses the context and significance of the research, which might include references to specific datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on data or datasets**. In this paper, it appears that section 4.1 is titled "Data description and parameter estimation," which is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets used in the analysis. I will carefully read this section to identify any datasets mentioned, including their names, descriptions, and any relevant statistics.

In section 4.1, the authors describe the datasets used for their analysis, including:

1. **Historical data of aggregate power demand in Italy**: This dataset includes time series data on power demand, which is crucial for modeling the energy community's behavior.

2. **Historical data of electricity spot price in Italy**: This dataset provides information on the fluctuations in electricity prices, which is essential for understanding the economic aspects of renewable energy communities.

3. **Historical data of gas spot price in Italy**: This dataset is relevant for analyzing the costs associated with gas as an energy source in the context of renewable energy communities.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset. The citations may not be explicitly listed as datasets but could be referenced in the context of the data used in the analysis.

For example, the citations for the datasets might look like this:

- For the **historical data of aggregate power demand in Italy**:
  > Italian Energy Authority. *Historical Data of Aggregate Power Demand in Italy*. Available at [link].

- For the **historical data of electricity spot price in Italy**:
  > Italian Energy Authority. *Historical Data of Electricity Spot Prices in Italy*. Available at [link].

- For the **historical data of gas spot price in Italy**:
  > Italian Energy Authority. *Historical Data of Gas Spot Prices in Italy*. Available at [link].

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations. This will ensure that the extracted information is clear and ready for further processing or review.
