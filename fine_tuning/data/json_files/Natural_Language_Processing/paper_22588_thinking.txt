To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Neural Active Learning Meets the Partial Monitoring Framework" by Maxime Heuillet et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors conducted an empirical evaluation on **open source datasets**, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 5) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, they explicitly list the datasets for both binary and multi-class OAL tasks. The datasets mentioned include:

1. **Adult Dataset**: This dataset is referenced as being from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
2. **Magic Telescope Dataset**: Also from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
3. **Modified MNIST Dataset**: This dataset is a variant of the original MNIST dataset, specifically for distinguishing between odd and even numbers.
4. **Covertype Dataset**: Another dataset from the UCI repository.
5. **Shuttle Dataset**: Again, this dataset is sourced from the UCI repository.
6. **Fashion MNIST Dataset**: This dataset is mentioned as a benchmark for machine learning algorithms.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide a brief description of each dataset's purpose and the context in which they were used. This confirms their relevance to the study.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. The citations I will look for include:

- For the **Adult Dataset**:
  > Asuncion, A., & Newman, D. J. (2007). UCI Machine Learning Repository. 

- For the **Magic Telescope Dataset**:
  > Asuncion, A., & Newman, D. J. (2007). UCI Machine Learning Repository.

- For the **Modified MNIST Dataset**:
  > LeCun, Y., Cortes, C., & Burges, C. J. C. (2010). The MNIST database of handwritten digits. 

- For the **Covertype Dataset**:
  > Asuncion, A., & Newman, D. J. (2007). UCI Machine Learning Repository.

- For the **Shuttle Dataset**:
  > Asuncion, A., & Newman, D. J. (2007). UCI Machine Learning Repository.

- For the **Fashion MNIST Dataset**:
  > Xiao, H., Rasul, K., & Vollgraf, R. (2017). Fashion-MNIST: A novel image dataset for benchmarking machine learning algorithms.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will allow for a structured output that can be used for further analysis or integration into other systems.
