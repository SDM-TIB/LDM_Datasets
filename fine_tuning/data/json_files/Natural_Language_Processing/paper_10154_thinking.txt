To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Proceedings of the 3rd International Workshop on Autonomous Systems Safety," I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by scanning the **abstract and introduction** sections for any mentions of datasets. These sections often provide a summary of the research and may highlight key datasets used in the study.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any relevant subsections that discuss the data used in the research. In this paper, I will pay particular attention to sections that might detail findings or methodologies, as they often reference specific datasets.

If the paper includes a **methodology or experiments section**, I will examine these closely, as they typically describe the datasets used for analysis or validation of the proposed methods. I will note any datasets mentioned, including their names, descriptions, and any relevant statistics or characteristics.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the means to locate the original sources of the datasets.

For example, if I find a dataset named "Autonomous Vehicle Dataset," I will look for its citation in the references. If the citation is not directly provided, I may need to conduct a brief search to find the original source of the dataset, ensuring I have the correct authors, title, publication venue, and year.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, into a structured format that clearly presents each dataset's information.

Finally, I will ensure that all extracted datasets are accurately represented and that their citations are complete and formatted correctly, ready for inclusion in any further analysis or documentation.
