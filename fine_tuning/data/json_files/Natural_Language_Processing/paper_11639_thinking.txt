To extract datasets from the research paper titled "UltraGlove: Hand Pose Estimation with MEMS-Ultrasonic Sensors" by Qiang Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract highlights the development of a hand-tracking glove and mentions the use of a training dataset, which indicates that datasets are likely discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental sections**, particularly **section 4 (Experimental Verification and Applications)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for training and evaluation. In **section 4.1 (Dataset Statistics)**, the authors explicitly mention two datasets:

1. **InterHand2.6m Dataset**: This dataset is described as a large-scale hand pose estimation dataset containing over 2.6 million hand images with corresponding 3D hand joint annotations. It includes 46,000 unique hand poses, which are used for pre-training the model.

2. **Real-world Dataset**: The authors mention that their real-world dataset consists of around 5,000 frames, each containing a raw distance matrix and the corresponding hand pose represented as 23 joint positions. This dataset is used for fine-tuning their model.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **InterHand2.6m Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Gyeongsik Moon, Ju Yong Chang, and Kyoung Mu Lee. *Interhand2.6M: A dataset and baseline for 3D interacting hand pose estimation from a single RGB image*. In Computer Vision–ECCV 2020: 16th European Conference, Glasgow, UK, August 23–28, 2020, Proceedings, Part XX 16. Springer, 548–564.

- The **real-world dataset** does not have a specific citation since it is a dataset collected by the authors themselves for their experiments. However, I will note its description and context as it is relevant to their work.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets in a clear format, ensuring that I include the full citations for the datasets mentioned in the paper. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, which is crucial for reproducibility and further research in the field.
