To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On the Compositional Generalization Gap of In-Context Learning" by Arian Hosseini et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, method, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions evaluating models on three semantic parsing datasets, which indicates that datasets are present.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors discuss the experiments conducted on CFQ, SCAN, and GeoQuery datasets. This section provides a clear indication of the datasets used for their evaluations.

In the **method section**, the authors describe the tasks associated with each dataset. They mention CFQ (Compositional Freebase Questions), SCAN (an instruction-following task), and GeoQuery (a text-to-SQL dataset). Each dataset is briefly described, which helps in understanding their purpose and structure.

Then, I will look into the **experiments section** to confirm the datasets used and any specific splits or variations mentioned. The authors specify that they used the MCD-1 splits for CFQ and SCAN, and the template split for GeoQuery. This detail is crucial for accurately documenting the datasets.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are essential for proper attribution and to provide readers with sources for further exploration.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

1. **CFQ (Compositional Freebase Questions)**:
   > Keysers, D., SchÃ¤rli, N., Scales, N., Buisman, H., Furrer, D., Kashubin, S., Momchev, N., Sinopalnikov, D., Stafiak, L., Tihon, T., Tsarkov, D., Wang, X., van Zee, M., & Bousquet, O. (2020). Measuring compositional generalization: A comprehensive method on realistic data. In *8th International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR 2020)*.

2. **SCAN (Sequence to Action)**:
   > Lake, B. M., & Baroni, M. (2018). Generalization without systematicity: On the compositional skills of sequence-to-sequence recurrent networks. In *Proceedings of the 35th International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2018)*.

3. **GeoQuery**:
   > Zelle, J. M., & Mooney, R. J. (1996). Learning to parse database queries using inductive logic programming. In *Proceedings of the Thirteenth National Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI 1996)*.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This systematic approach ensures that I capture all relevant details about the datasets used in the research paper.
