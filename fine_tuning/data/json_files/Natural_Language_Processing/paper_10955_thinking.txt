To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Cost-optimal Fleet Management Strategies for Solar-electric Autonomous Mobility-on-Demand Systems" by Fabio Paparella et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their full citations.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions a case study conducted in Gold Coast, Australia, which suggests that there may be specific datasets related to travel requests and operational data for the fleet. The introduction further discusses the optimization of fleet operations, hinting at the use of real-world data.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **results** sections. In this paper, the authors refer to data on the road network and travel requests obtained from "Transportation Networks for Research." This indicates that there is a specific dataset being utilized for their case study.

In the **case study section (III.A)**, the authors explicitly mention that they used data on over 30,000 travel requests served by a fleet of 800 vehicles. This is a significant dataset that I need to document.

I will also check the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper cites the following sources:

1. **Transportation Networks for Research**: 
   > T. N. for Research Core Team. Transportation networks for research. Available at https://github.com/bstabler/transportationnetworks. Accessed January 05, 2023.

2. **Lightyear** (for vehicle specifications):
   > Lightyear. (2016) Available online at https://lightyear.one/. Accessed: 26/09/2022.

3. **Uber Technologies** (for cost models):
   > (2018) Updating method on Uber payment account. Available at https://help.uber.com/h/8f78dca4-9d75-44f1-bdc1-e90ca3da0319.

Now, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format. The datasets I will include are:

1. **Dataset of Travel Requests**: This dataset contains over 30,000 travel requests used in the case study.
   - Citation: T. N. for Research Core Team. Transportation networks for research. Available at https://github.com/bstabler/transportationnetworks. Accessed January 05, 2023.

2. **Vehicle Specifications Dataset**: This dataset includes specifications for the Lightyear 0 vehicle used in the study.
   - Citation: Lightyear. (2016) Available online at https://lightyear.one/. Accessed: 26/09/2022.

3. **Cost Model Dataset**: This dataset provides the cost models used for generating revenues from serving requests.
   - Citation: (2018) Updating method on Uber payment account. Available at https://help.uber.com/h/8f78dca4-9d75-44f1-bdc1-e90ca3da0319.

After gathering all this information, I will ensure that each dataset is clearly described and that the citations are complete and accurate. This will allow for proper referencing and validation of the datasets used in the research.
