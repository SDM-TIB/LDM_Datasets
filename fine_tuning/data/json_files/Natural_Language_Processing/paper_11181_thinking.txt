To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Infusing Lattice Symmetry Priors in Attention Mechanisms for Sample-Efficient Abstract Geometric Reasoning" by Mattia Atzeni et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the **Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC)** and its language-complete version (LARC), indicating that these are key datasets used in the research.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors discuss the ARC as an AI benchmark based on core knowledge priors. They emphasize the challenges posed by this dataset, which suggests its significance in their experiments.

In the **experiments section**, particularly in **section 5.2**, the authors explicitly state that they assessed their model's performance on a subset of the ARC dataset that requires geometric priors. This confirms that ARC is indeed a dataset used for evaluation.

Additionally, the authors mention the **Language-complete ARC (LARC)** in the context of comparing their model's performance against other baselines. This indicates that both ARC and LARC are critical datasets for their research.

Now, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. **Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC)**:
   - Citation:
     > Chollet, F. (2019). *On the measure of intelligence*. CoRR, abs/1911.01547. URL: http://arxiv.org/abs/1911.01547.

2. **Language-complete Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (LARC)**:
   - Citation:
     > Acquaviva, S., Pu, Y., Kryven, M., Wong, C., Ecanow, G. E., Nye, M. I., Sechopoulos, T., Tessler, M. H., and Tenenbaum, J. B. (2021). *Communicating natural programs to humans and machines*. CoRR, abs/2106.07824. URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.07824.

With these citations in hand, I can now summarize the datasets identified in the paper:

- **Dataset 1**: Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC)
  - Citation: Chollet, F. (2019). *On the measure of intelligence*. CoRR, abs/1911.01547. URL: http://arxiv.org/abs/1911.01547.

- **Dataset 2**: Language-complete Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (LARC)
  - Citation: Acquaviva, S., Pu, Y., Kryven, M., Wong, C., Ecanow, G. E., Nye, M. I., Sechopoulos, T., Tessler, M. H., and Tenenbaum, J. B. (2021). *Communicating natural programs to humans and machines*. CoRR, abs/2106.07824. URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.07824.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or analysis.
