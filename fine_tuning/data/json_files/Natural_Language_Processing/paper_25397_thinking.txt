To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Mamba-PTQ: Outlier Channels in Recurrent Large Language Models" by Alessandro Pierro et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. The introduction may provide context or reference datasets used in the experiments, so I will pay close attention to any mentions of datasets or benchmarks.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (section 4) to identify any datasets used for evaluation. This section typically contains detailed information about the experimental setup, including the datasets employed. I will specifically look for any tables or figures that summarize the datasets or their characteristics.

In this paper, the authors mention evaluating their methods on several downstream tasks, but they do not explicitly list datasets in the experiments section. However, they do reference specific datasets in the context of the tasks they evaluate. I will note these tasks and the corresponding datasets mentioned in the text.

The paper references the following datasets:

1. **WikiText-2**: This dataset is mentioned in the context of analyzing activation patterns for the Mamba model. It is used to measure the absolute maximum activation across channels.

2. **LAMBADA**: This dataset is used for evaluating the model's performance on word prediction requiring a broad discourse context.

3. **HellaSwag**: This dataset is mentioned as one of the downstream tasks for evaluating the model's performance.

4. **PIQA**: Another dataset referenced for evaluating the model's reasoning about physical commonsense in natural language.

5. **WinoGrande**: This dataset is also used for evaluating the model's performance on commonsense reasoning tasks.

6. **RTE**: The Recognizing Textual Entailment dataset is mentioned as part of the evaluation tasks.

7. **COPA**: This dataset is included in the evaluation for assessing causal reasoning.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. Here are the citations I will extract:

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
