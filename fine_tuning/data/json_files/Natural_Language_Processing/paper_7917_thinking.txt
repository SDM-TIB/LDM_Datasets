To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Modeling Dispersive Silver in the Electrodynamic Lattice-Boltzmann Method Using Complex-Conjugate Pole-Residue Pairs" by Cael Warner et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any references to datasets or measurements that are crucial for the research.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors may discuss previous works and datasets used in their research. I will look for specific mentions of datasets or references to empirical data that support their findings.

In the **methodology section**, the authors describe their approach and may reference specific datasets used for modeling or comparison. I will pay close attention to any tables or figures that might summarize the datasets or parameters used in their simulations.

The **results section** is also critical as it often includes comparisons with existing datasets or empirical measurements. I will look for any figures or tables that present data, as well as any references to datasets used for validation of their model.

After identifying potential datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to ensure that the datasets can be accessed or verified by others.

In this paper, the authors mention using a **CCPRP model for dispersive silver** and reference empirical data for the refractive index and extinction coefficient of evaporated silver. I will extract the following datasets:

1. **Complex-Conjugate Pole-Residue Pairs for Silver**: This dataset includes parameters for modeling the permittivity of silver, which is essential for their simulations.

2. **Empirical Data for Refractive Index and Extinction Coefficient**: The authors compare their model against measurements of the refractive index and extinction coefficient for evaporated silver.

Now, I will compile the full citations for these datasets from the references section:

- For the **CCPRP model**, the citation is:
  > Minghui Han, R. Dutton, and Shanhui Fan. "Model dispersive media in finite-difference time-domain method with complex-conjugate pole-residue pairs." *IEEE Microwave and Wireless Components Letters*, vol. 16, no. 3, pp. 119–121, Mar 2006.

- For the **empirical data on evaporated silver**, the citation is:
  > D. W. Lynch and W. R. Hunter. "Comments on the Optical Constants of Metals and an Introduction to the Data for Several Metals." In *Handbook of Optical Constants of Solids*, vol. 1, pp. 275–367, Elsevier, 1985.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets and their citations in a structured format for easy reference and further analysis.
