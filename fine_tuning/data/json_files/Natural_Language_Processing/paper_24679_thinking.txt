To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Core Knowledge Learning Framework for Graph Adaptation and Scalability Learning" by Bowen Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a high-level overview, and I will look for any mentions of datasets or experiments that involve specific datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly the subsections that discuss the datasets used for both the graph domain adaptation task and the few-shot learning task. In this paper, the authors present tables summarizing the datasets, which will be crucial for my extraction process.

In **Table 1**, I find the following datasets related to the graph domain adaptation task:

1. **Mutagenicity**: This dataset consists of 4,337 graphs, with an average of 30.32 nodes and 18.09 edges, and it has 2 classes.
   - Citation: Kazius, J., McGuire, R., & Bursi, R. (2005). Derivation and validation of toxicophores for mutagenicity prediction. *Journal of Medicinal Chemistry*, 48(1), 312-320.

2. **Tox21_AhR**: This dataset contains 8,169 graphs, with an average of 39.1 nodes and 284.3 edges, also with 2 classes.
   - Citation: Tox21 Challenge. (n.d.). Retrieved from https://tripod.nih.gov/tox21/challenge/data.jsp

3. **FRANKENSTEIN**: This dataset has 4,337 graphs, with an average of 41.2 nodes and 26.3 edges, and it has 2 classes.
   - Citation: Orsini, F., Frasconi, P., & De Raedt, L. (2015). Graph invariant kernels. In *Proceedings of the International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence* (pp. 3756-3762).

4. **PROTEINS**: This dataset includes 1,113 graphs, with an average of 35.8 nodes and 21.3 edges, and it has 2 classes.
   - Citation: Dobson, P. D., & Doig, A. J. (2003). Distinguishing enzyme structures from non-enzymes without alignments. *Journal of Molecular Biology*, 330(4), 771-783.

5. **COX2**: This dataset consists of 467 graphs, with an average of 30.77 nodes and 18.50 edges, and it has 2 classes.
   - Citation: Sutherland, J. J., O’Brien, L. A., & Weaver, D. F. (2003). Spline-fitting with a genetic algorithm: A method for developing classification structure-activity relationships. *Journal of Chemical Information and Computer Sciences*.

6. **BZR**: This dataset contains 405 graphs, with an average of 38.4 nodes and 225.1 edges, and it has 2 classes.
   - Citation: Sutherland, J. J., O’Brien, L. A., & Weaver, D. F. (2003). Spline-fitting with a genetic algorithm: A method for developing classification structure-activity relationships. *Journal of Chemical Information and Computer Sciences*.

In **Table 2**, I will also extract datasets related to the few-shot learning task:

1. **Tox21**: This dataset has 8,014 compounds and 12 tasks.
   - Citation: Tox21 Challenge. (n.d.). Retrieved from https://tripod.nih.gov/tox21/challenge/data.jsp

2. **SIDER**: This dataset includes 1,427 compounds and 27 tasks.
   - Citation: Kazius, J., McGuire, R., & Bursi, R. (2005). Derivation and validation of toxicophores for mutagenicity prediction. *Journal of Medicinal Chemistry*, 48(1), 312-320.

3. **MUV**: This dataset consists of 9,312 compounds and 17 tasks.
   - Citation: Tox21 Challenge. (n.d.). Retrieved from https://tripod.nih.gov/tox21/challenge/data.jsp

4. **ToxCast**: This dataset has 8,615 compounds and 617 tasks.
   - Citation: Tox21 Challenge. (n.d.). Retrieved from https://tripod.nih.gov/tox21/challenge/data.jsp

After identifying these datasets, I will ensure to compile the full citations accurately, as they are crucial for proper referencing in any subsequent work.

Finally, I will summarize the extracted datasets along with their citations in a structured format for easy reference and further processing.
