To extract datasets from the research paper titled "PPRSteg: Printing and Photography Robust QR Code Steganography via Attention Flow-Based Model" by Huayuan Ye et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted "comprehensive and detailed experiments" and refers to "training and testing datasets of host images" and "QR Code images." This indicates that there are specific datasets used in their experiments.

Next, I will look closely at **section 4 (Experiment)**, where the authors typically describe their experimental setup, including the datasets used. In this section, they explicitly mention two datasets:

1. **COCO Dataset**: The authors state that they used the train2017 (118K) and test2017 (41K) datasets from COCO for host images. This dataset is widely recognized in the computer vision community.

2. **Custom QR Code Dataset**: The authors mention that they manually constructed a training dataset of 50,000 QR Code images and a testing dataset of 41,000 QR Code images, generated with specific parameters (QR Code version 5 with the highest error correction level).

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the **References section** of the paper:

- For the **COCO Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, Serge Belongie, James Hays, Pietro Perona, Deva Ramanan, Piotr Dollár, and C Lawrence Zitnick. *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. In Computer Vision–ECCV 2014: 13th European Conference, Zurich, Switzerland, September 6-12, 2014, Proceedings, Part V 13, pages 740–755. Springer, 2014.

- The **Custom QR Code Dataset** does not have a formal citation since it was manually constructed by the authors. However, I will note the details provided in the paper about its creation.

After collecting this information, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **COCO Dataset**: Used for host images, consisting of 118,000 training images and 41,000 testing images.
2. **Custom QR Code Dataset**: Consists of 50,000 training QR Code images and 41,000 testing QR Code images, generated with specific QR Code parameters.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited.
