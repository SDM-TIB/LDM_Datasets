To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Focused Prefix Tuning for Controllable Text Generation" by Congda Ma et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I accurately identify and cite each dataset mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of a controllable text generation dataset, which indicates that datasets are involved. I will look for specific names of datasets in these sections.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of controllable text generation and mention datasets like **AGNews** and **IMDb** as examples of datasets used for training models with explicit attributes. This is a good indication that these datasets are relevant to the experiments.

Next, I will examine **section 4 (Single-attribute Control Experiments)**, where the authors describe their experimental setup. They explicitly mention using the **AGNews dataset** for topic control and the **IMDb dataset** for sentiment control. This confirms that these datasets are indeed utilized in their experiments.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **AGNews dataset**, the citation is:
   > Zhang, Xiang, Junbo Zhao, and Yann LeCun. "Character-level convolutional networks for text classification." In Advances in neural information processing systems, pages 649–657, 2015.

2. For the **IMDb dataset**, the citation is:
   > Maas, Andrew L., Raymond E. Daly, Peter T. Pham, Dan Huang, Andrew Y. Ng, and Christopher Potts. "Learning word vectors for sentiment analysis." In Proceedings of the 49th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, pages 142–150, Portland, Oregon, USA, 2011.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will summarize the findings:

- **AGNews Dataset**: Used for topic control tasks, it contains news articles categorized into four topics.
- **IMDb Dataset**: Used for sentiment control tasks, it consists of movie reviews labeled as positive or negative.

With this information, I can now prepare the dataset entries for further processing or documentation.
