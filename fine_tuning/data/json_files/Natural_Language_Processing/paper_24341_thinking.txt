To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Qiskit HumanEval: An Evaluation Benchmark For Quantum Code Generative Models" by Sanjay Vishwakarma et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and dataset description sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract introduces the **Qiskit HumanEval dataset**, which is a hand-curated collection of tasks designed to benchmark the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to produce quantum code using Qiskit. This indicates that the dataset is central to the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section III (Dataset Description)**, where the authors provide a detailed overview of the Qiskit HumanEval dataset. They mention that it consists of **101 distinct tasks** organized into eight categories, each designed to evaluate different aspects of quantum programming. This section will likely contain specific details about the dataset's structure and purpose.

In this section, the authors describe the dataset's composition, including the types of tasks it includes, such as **Quantum Circuit Generation, Simulation and Execution, State Preparation and Analysis, Algorithm Implementation, Gate Operations and Manipulation, Visualization and Post-Processing, Advanced Circuit Manipulation, and Quantum Circuit Serialization**. Each category is associated with a number of tasks, which provides insight into the dataset's breadth.

The authors also mention that the dataset is inspired by the **HumanEval Dataset**, which is a well-known benchmark for code generation. This connection is important for understanding the dataset's context and relevance.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the HumanEval dataset, as it is referenced as a foundational work for the Qiskit HumanEval dataset. The citation for the HumanEval dataset is:

- For **HumanEval Dataset**:
  > Chen, M., et al. "Evaluating Large Language Models Trained on Code." 2021.

Additionally, I will note that the Qiskit HumanEval dataset itself does not have a separate citation provided in the paper, as it is introduced as a new benchmark created by the authors.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the HumanEval dataset and clearly describe the Qiskit HumanEval dataset as the primary dataset discussed in the paper.

In summary, the key dataset extracted from the paper is the **Qiskit HumanEval dataset**, which is a novel benchmark for evaluating LLMs in quantum code generation, and its foundational reference is the **HumanEval Dataset** by Chen et al. I will ensure to document this information accurately for future reference.
