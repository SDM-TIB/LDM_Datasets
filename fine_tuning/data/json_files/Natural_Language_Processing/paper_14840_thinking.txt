To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-task Explainable Skin Lesion Classification" by Mahapara Khurshid, Mayank Vatsa, and Richa Singh, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that three dermatological datasets are used for evaluation, which suggests that I should look for their names and details.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Dataset Description and Preparation)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention:

1. **HAM10000**: This dataset contains 10,015 dermatoscopic images corresponding to seven classes of skin lesions, including Melanoma, Melanocytic Nevi, and others.

2. **PH2**: This dataset consists of 200 dermoscopic images corresponding to three classes: Common nevi, Atypical nevi, and Melanoma.

3. **Derm7pt**: This dataset contains over 2000 clinical and dermoscopy images pertaining to 20 classes.

The authors also describe how they selected specific classes from HAM10000 for training and testing, which is important for understanding the context of the datasets.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **HAM10000**, the citation is:
  > P. Tschandl, C. Rosendahl, H. Kittler. *The HAM10000 dataset, a large collection of multi-source dermatoscopic images of common pigmented skin lesions*. Scientific Data, 5, 2018.

- For **PH2**, the citation is:
  > T. MendonÃ§a, P. M. Ferreira, J. S. Marques, A. R. Marcal, J. Rozeira. *PH2 - A dermoscopic image database for research and benchmarking*. International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society, 2013.

- For **Derm7pt**, the citation is:
  > J. Kawahara, S. Daneshvar, G. Argenziano, G. Hamarneh. *Seven-point checklist and skin lesion classification using multitask multimodal neural nets*. IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics, 23, 2018.

With these citations, I now have the necessary information to describe each dataset accurately.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that is ready for review or further processing, ensuring that each dataset is clearly identified with its full citation.
