To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An Integrative Survey on Mental Health Conversational Agents to Bridge Computer Science and Medical Perspectives" by Young-Min Cho et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, results, and discussion sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any references to datasets or data sources used in the research.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, where the authors typically describe their data collection process. In this paper, they mention conducting a systematic review of 534 papers, which suggests that they may have compiled datasets from these studies. I will look for specific datasets or databases referenced in this section.

I will also check the **results section** for any tables or figures that summarize data or datasets used in the analysis. If the authors present any datasets in tabular form, I will note their names and any relevant details.

Finally, I will consult the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned in the paper. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required.

For example, if the authors mention using a dataset from a specific study, I will extract the name of the dataset, a brief description, and the citation for that study. I will repeat this process for each dataset identified in the paper.

Once I have all the datasets and their citations, I will organize them into a structured format for easy reference and further analysis.
