To extract datasets from the research paper titled "OptiGrad: A Fair and more Efficient Price Elasticity Optimization via a Gradient Based Learning" by Vincent Grari and Marcin Detyniecki, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often discusses the context and relevance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention the need for new pricing strategies in the non-life insurance sector, but they do not specify any datasets yet. I will continue to the **experiments section** to find more concrete information.

In **section 4 (Experiments)**, the authors explicitly state that they used the **Atoti Dataset**, which is based on the Kaggle automobile insurance quotes and sales dataset. They mention that this dataset comprises 46,129 instances, divided into training, development, and test sets. This is a clear indication of a dataset being utilized for their experiments.

Next, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citation for the Atoti Dataset and the Kaggle dataset mentioned. The citation for the Kaggle dataset is as follows:
- For the **Kaggle automobile insurance quotes and sales dataset**:
  > Ranja7. *Vehicle Insurance Customer Data*. Kaggle. Available at: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ranja7/vehicle-insurance-customer-data.

The Atoti dataset is mentioned as being enriched through synthetic data generation, but it does not have a specific citation provided in the references. Therefore, I will note that it is derived from the Kaggle dataset.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required.

1. **Atoti Dataset**: This dataset is specifically designed for elasticity optimization purposes and is based on the Kaggle automobile insurance quotes and sales dataset. It comprises 46,129 instances, divided into training (60%), development (25%), and test (20%) sets.

2. **Kaggle Automobile Insurance Quotes and Sales Dataset**: 
   > Ranja7. *Vehicle Insurance Customer Data*. Kaggle. Available at: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ranja7/vehicle-insurance-customer-data.

After gathering this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for further processing or review.
