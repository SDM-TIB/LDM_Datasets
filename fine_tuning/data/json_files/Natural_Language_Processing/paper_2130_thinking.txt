To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SGG: Spinbot, Grammarly and GloVe based Fake News Detection" by Akansha Gautam and Koteswar Rao Jerripothula, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method on the **Fake News AMT dataset** and **Celebrity dataset**, which suggests that these are the datasets I need to focus on.

Next, I will look closely at the **experimental results section** (Section III) where the authors describe their experiments. They explicitly mention that they conducted experiments on two publicly available benchmark datasets for fake news detection: 

1. **FakeNewsAMT Dataset**: This dataset is described as being collected through manual and crowdsourcing annotation efforts, containing 480 news articles across six domains (Technology, Business, Education, Sports, Politics, and Entertainment). The authors also mention that the news articles were sourced from various mainstream websites in the US.

2. **Celebrity Dataset**: This dataset consists of 500 celebrity news articles collected from online magazines such as Entertainment Weekly and People Magazine. The authors note that the distribution of fake and legitimate news articles is evenly distributed in this dataset.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for future researchers.

- For the **FakeNewsAMT dataset**, the citation is:
  > V. Prez-Rosas, B. Kleinberg, A. Lefevre, and R. Mihalcea. "Automatic detection of fake news." In Proceedings of the 27th International Conference on Computational Linguistics. Association for Computational Linguistics, Santa Fe, New Mexico, USA: Association for Computational Linguistics, 2017, p. 3391-3401.

- For the **Celebrity dataset**, the citation is not explicitly provided in the paper, but it is common practice to refer to the original source or the dataset creators. If the dataset is widely known, I will note that it is derived from various entertainment-oriented publications.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets and their citations in a structured format, ensuring that I include all necessary details for each dataset.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured output that is ready for review or further processing.
