To extract datasets from the research paper titled "How 'one-size-fits-all' public works contract does it better? An assessment of infrastructure provision in Italy" by Massimo Finocchiaro Castro et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on public infrastructure procurement in Italy, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. 

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any references to specific datasets. The introduction discusses the importance of public procurement and the challenges faced, but again, it does not specify any datasets.

Moving on to the **methods and empirical strategy section**, I will look for any mention of datasets used for analysis. Here, the authors state that they will analyze a unique dataset of public works contracts awarded in Italy between 2008 and 2014. This indicates that there is a dataset central to their analysis.

In the **data section**, the authors provide more details about the dataset. They mention that the dataset is sourced from the Observatory of the Public Contracts at the ANAC (National Anti-Corruption Authority) and covers contracts with a reserve price between €40,000 and €200,000 awarded between 2008 and 2014. This section confirms the dataset's relevance and scope.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. However, since the dataset is derived from a governmental source (ANAC), it may not have a traditional citation like academic papers. Instead, I will note the source as follows:

- **Dataset**: Public works contracts awarded in Italy between 2008 and 2014.
  - **Source**: Observatory of the Public Contracts, ANAC (National Anti-Corruption Authority), Italy.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the dataset as specified. This will allow for clear identification and referencing of the dataset used in the research.
