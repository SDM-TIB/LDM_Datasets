To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Uncertainty in Additive Feature Attribution methods" by Abhishek Madaan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors analyze uncertainty in feature attribution methods and mentions the use of datasets for experiments, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **Dataset Descriptions** section, which is likely where the authors provide detailed information about the datasets used in their experiments. In this section, the authors explicitly mention two datasets:

1. **UCI Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset**: This dataset is described as a binary classification dataset with 768 observations and 8 input features related to patient medical records. The authors explain its relevance to the context of XAI in medical diagnostics.

2. **Synthetic Dataset**: The authors describe this dataset as a larger-scale synthetic dataset created for their experiments, consisting of 100 features and 200,000 instances. They provide details on how this dataset was generated, including the methods used for creating instances and ground-truth labels.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. 

For the **UCI Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset**, the citation is:
> Smith, A. (1988). *Diabetes data set*. UCI Machine Learning Repository. Available at: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jbrownlee/Datasets/master/pima-indians-diabetes.csv

For the **Synthetic Dataset**, since it is generated by the authors, I will reference the paper itself as the source:
> Liu, Y., Khandagale, S., White, C., & Neiswanger, W. (2021). *Synthetic Benchmarks for Scientific Research in Explainable Machine Learning*. arXiv:2106.12543.

Now that I have the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations.
