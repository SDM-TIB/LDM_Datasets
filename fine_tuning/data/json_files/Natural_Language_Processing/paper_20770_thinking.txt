To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Make-It-Vivid: Dressing Your Animatable Biped Cartoon Characters from Text" by Junshu Tang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to gather initial insights about the datasets. The abstract mentions the creation of a detailed text-texture paired dataset for 3D characters, which indicates that a dataset is indeed involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly mention the dataset used for training their model. Here, they state that their model is trained on the **3DBiCar dataset**, which contains 1,500 high-quality 3D models of cartoon characters with diverse identities and shapes.

In this section, the authors provide a brief description of the dataset, noting that it includes various character species such as Human, Bear, Mouse, Cat, and others. This detailed description confirms the dataset's relevance to their research.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the **3DBiCar dataset**. The citation provided in the references is:

- For **3DBiCar dataset**:
  > Zhongjin Luo, Shengcai Cai, Jinguo Dong, Ruibo Ming, Liangdong Qiu, Xiaohang Zhan, and Xiaoguang Han. *Rabbit: Parametric modeling of 3D biped cartoon characters with a topological-consistent dataset*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 12825â€“12835, 2023.

Having identified the dataset and its citation, I will now compile this information into a structured format for clarity and future reference.

In summary, the key steps I followed were:
1. Read through the abstract and introduction to identify mentions of datasets.
2. Focus on the experiments section to find explicit details about the datasets used.
3. Retrieve the full citation from the references section to ensure proper attribution.

This methodical approach ensures that I accurately capture the necessary information about the datasets used in the research paper.
