To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Chain of Thought Explanation for Dialogue State Tracking" by Lin Xu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on three widely recognized DST benchmarks: **MultiWOZ 2.2, WoZ 2.0, and M2M**. This indicates that these datasets are likely to be detailed further in the paper.

Next, I will look into **section 4 (Experiment Settings)**, where the authors provide a dedicated subsection titled **Datasets**. Here, they explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments:

1. **MultiWOZ 2.2**: This dataset is described as a human-to-human, multi-domain, task-oriented dialogue dataset featuring over 10,000 dialogues across 8 domains. It provides a well-structured schema for the DST task.

2. **M2M**: This dataset consists of 3000 simulated dialogues from 2 domains, which were later refined by humans. The authors refer to its sub-dataset from the restaurant and movie domains as **M2M-R** and **M2M-M**, respectively.

3. **WoZ 2.0**: This dataset is derived from a Wizard-of-Oz experiment where users type text in their queries, resulting in more complex dialogue contexts.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for each dataset:

- For **MultiWOZ 2.2**, the citation is:
  > Budzianowski, P., Wen, T.-H., Tseng, B.-H., Casanueva, I., Ultes, S., Ramadan, O., & Gašić, M. (2018). MultiWOZ - a large-scale multi-domain Wizard-of-Oz dataset for task-oriented dialogue modelling. In Proceedings of the 2018 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (pp. 5016–5026). Association for Computational Linguistics.

- For **M2M**, the citation is:
  > Loshchilov, I., & Hutter, F. Machine Talking To Machines. (No further details provided in the text).

- For **WoZ 2.0**, the citation is:
  > Mrkšić, N., Ó Séaghdha, D., Wen, T.-H., Thomson, B., & Young, S. (2017). Neural belief tracker: Data-driven dialogue state tracking. In Proceedings of the 55th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (pp. 1777–1788). Association for Computational Linguistics.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
