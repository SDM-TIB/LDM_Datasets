To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DePRL: Achieving Linear Convergence Speedup in Personalized Decentralized Learning with Shared Representations" by Guojun Xiong et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on different datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they explicitly mention using several datasets for their experiments. I will look for any tables or figures that summarize the datasets, as these often provide concise information.

Upon reviewing the experiments section, I find that the authors used the following datasets:

1. **CIFAR-100**: A dataset consisting of 60,000 32x32 color images in 100 classes, with 50,000 samples for training and 10,000 for testing.
2. **CIFAR-10**: Similar to CIFAR-100 but with only 10 classes.
3. **Fashion-MNIST**: A dataset of 60,000 training and 10,000 testing grayscale images of clothing items.
4. **HARBox**: A human activity recognition dataset collected from smartphones, consisting of 9-axis IMU data from 121 users.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper documentation. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **CIFAR-100** and **CIFAR-10**:
  > Krizhevsky, A., Hinton, G., et al. (2009). *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. [Link to dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html).

- For **Fashion-MNIST**:
  > Xiao, H., Rasul, K., & Vollgraf, R. (2017). *Fashion-MNIST: A Novel Image Dataset for Benchmarking Machine Learning Algorithms*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1708.07747.

- For **HARBox**:
  > Ouyang, X., Xie, Z., Zhou, J., Huang, J., & Xing, G. (2021). *ClusterFL: A Similarity-Aware Federated Learning System for Human Activity Recognition*. In Proceedings of the 19th Annual International Conference on Mobile Systems, Applications, and Services, 54â€“66.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference.

In summary, the datasets extracted from the paper are:
1. **CIFAR-100**: Krizhevsky et al. (2009)
2. **CIFAR-10**: Krizhevsky et al. (2009)
3. **Fashion-MNIST**: Xiao et al. (2017)
4. **HARBox**: Ouyang et al. (2021)

This structured approach ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the research paper.
