To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multimodal Interpretable Data-Driven Models for Early Prediction of Antimicrobial Multidrug Resistance Using Multivariate Time-Series" by Sergio Martínez-Agüero et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or data sources.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Dataset and Pre-Processing)**, as it is likely to contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the study. Here, the authors mention that they collected clinical data from the University Hospital of Fuenlabrada over 17 years, involving 2,784 patients and 3,158 ICU stays. This indicates a significant dataset that I need to document.

In this section, the authors describe the types of data collected, including static variables (demographic data) and multivariate time series (MTS) data related to patient health status. They specify that the dataset includes features related to cultures, treatments, and ICU occupancy, which are crucial for understanding the context of the study.

I will also check the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets or methodologies referenced in the paper. The authors may cite previous works that describe the datasets or methodologies they used, which is essential for providing complete citations.

The key datasets identified in this paper are:

1. **Clinical Data from University Hospital of Fuenlabrada**: This dataset includes health records of 2,784 patients over 3,158 ICU stays, focusing on the emergence of antimicrobial multidrug resistance (AMR). The data encompasses both static variables and multivariate time series.

2. **Multivariate Time Series Data**: This includes features related to patient cultures, treatments (e.g., antibiotics), and ICU occupancy, which are critical for predicting AMR.

Now, I will compile the full citations for these datasets. Since the clinical data is specific to the study and does not have a formal citation like a published dataset, I will note it as follows:

- **Clinical Data from University Hospital of Fuenlabrada**:

Next, I will ensure that I have captured all relevant details about the datasets, including their characteristics, the number of patients, and the types of data collected.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that all citations are complete and accurate.
