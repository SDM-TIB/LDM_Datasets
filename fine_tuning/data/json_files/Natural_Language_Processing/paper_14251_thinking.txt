To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Discrepancy Matters: Learning from Inconsistent Decoder Features for Consistent Semi-supervised Medical Image Segmentation" by Qingjie Zeng et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method on three public datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section IV (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, they explicitly mention three datasets:

1. **Pancreas Dataset**: This dataset consists of 82 contrast-enhanced abdomen CT scans, divided into 62 for training and 20 for testing.

2. **Lung Tumor Dataset**: This dataset includes 63 cases, with 50 for training and 13 for testing.

3. **Left Atrium Dataset**: This dataset contains 100 gadolinium-enhanced MR images, with 80 for training and 20 for testing.

The authors provide additional details about the preprocessing steps for these datasets, which helps in understanding their usage.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For the **Pancreas Dataset**:
  > H. R. Roth, L. Lu, A. Farag, H.-C. Shin, J. Liu, E. B. Turkbey, and R. M. Summers. *Deeporgan: Multi-level deep convolutional networks for automated pancreas segmentation*. In MICCAI, pp. 556â€“564, Springer, 2015.

- For the **Lung Tumor Dataset**:
  > M. Antonelli, A. Reinke, S. Bakas, K. Farahani, A. Kopp-Schneider, B. A. Landman, G. Litjens, B. Menze, O. Ronneberger, R. M. Summers, et al. *The medical segmentation decathlon*. Nature Communications, vol. 13, no. 1, p. 4128, 2022.

- For the **Left Atrium Dataset**:
  > Z. Xiong, Q. Xia, Z. Hu, N. Huang, C. Bian, Y. Zheng, S. Vesal, N. Ravikumar, A. Maier, X. Yang, et al. *A global benchmark of algorithms for segmenting the left atrium from late gadolinium-enhanced cardiac magnetic resonance imaging*. Medical Image Analysis, vol. 67, p. 101832, 2021.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their sources as presented in the paper.
