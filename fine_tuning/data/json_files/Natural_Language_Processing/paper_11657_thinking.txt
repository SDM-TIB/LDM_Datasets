To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Co-creating a globally interpretable model with human input" by Rahul Nair et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, approach, and examples sections** of the paper to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a general overview, but I need to look for specific datasets in the body of the paper.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of interpretable models and mention the need for human input in decision-making processes. However, they do not specify any datasets here.

Next, I will examine the **approach section**, where the authors describe their methodology. They reference previous work by Dash et al. (2018) but do not introduce any new datasets in this section.

Moving on to the **examples section**, I find two distinct applications where datasets are utilized:

1. **Tic-Tac-Toe Dataset**: The authors mention using a dataset related to the game of tic-tac-toe, specifically referencing the end game configurations. They provide a link to the dataset: 
   > UCI Machine Learning Repository. *Tic-Tac-Toe Endgame Dataset*. Available at: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Tic-Tac-Toe+Endgame.

2. **MIMIC-III Dataset**: In the healthcare example, the authors utilize the MIMIC-III dataset to analyze ICU admissions with suspected sepsis. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Johnson, A. E., Pollard, T. J., Shen, L., Lehman, L.-w. H., Feng, M., Ghassemi, M., Moody, B., Szolovits, P., Anthony Celi, L., and Mark, R. G. *MIMIC-III, a freely accessible critical care database*. Scientific Data, 3(1):1â€“9, 2016.

After identifying these datasets, I will ensure to note their descriptions and the context in which they are used in the paper. The Tic-Tac-Toe dataset is used to illustrate the model's ability to learn deterministic rules, while the MIMIC-III dataset is used to predict patient survival outcomes based on various medical conditions and treatments.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations as required. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets referenced in the paper, ready for further processing or review.
