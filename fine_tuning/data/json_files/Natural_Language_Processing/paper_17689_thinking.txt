To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Sentence-Level Planning of Long Clinical Summaries via Embedded Entity Retrieval" by Griffin Adams et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors trained their models on a large-scale dataset of approximately 167,000 in-patient hospital admissions, which suggests that this dataset is crucial for their research.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments and results sections**. In the paper, the authors mention that they trained on a dataset from Columbia University Irving Medical Center (CUIMC) covering admissions from 2020 to 2023. They also evaluate their models on three different datasets, which are likely to be important for understanding the scope of their work.

In the **datasets section**, I will find detailed descriptions of the datasets used for training and evaluation. The paper lists the following datasets:

1. **Columbia: 2020-2023**: This dataset consists of approximately 167,000 in-patient hospital admissions from CUIMC, which is the primary dataset used for training their models.

2. **Columbia: 2010-2014**: This dataset includes admissions from an earlier time period, allowing the authors to test the robustness of their models against different EHR styles.

3. **MIMIC-III**: A publicly available dataset containing clinical notes, which the authors use for evaluation purposes.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset from the **References section** of the paper:

- For the **Columbia dataset (2020-2023)**, the citation is:
  > Adams, G., Zucker, J., & Elhadad, N. (2023). Sentence-Level Planning of Long Clinical Summaries via Embedded Entity Retrieval. In Proceedings of the 61st Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers), pages 1-14.

- For the **Columbia dataset (2010-2014)**, the citation is:
  > Adams, G., Alsentzer, E., Ketenci, M., Zucker, J., & Elhadad, N. (2021). What’s in a summary? Laying the groundwork for advances in hospital-course summarization. In Proceedings of the 2021 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, pages 4794–4811.

- For the **MIMIC-III dataset**, the citation is:
  > Johnson, A. E. W., Pollard, T. J., Shen, L., Lehman, L. W. H., Feng, M., Ghassemi, M., Moody, B., Szolovits, P., Celi, L. A., & Mark, R. G. (2016). MIMIC-III, a freely accessible critical care database. Scientific Data, 3(1), 1-9.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that highlights the dataset names, descriptions, and citations. This will ensure that the datasets are clearly documented and can be referenced appropriately in future work.
