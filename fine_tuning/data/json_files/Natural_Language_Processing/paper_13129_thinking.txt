To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Home monitoring for frailty detection through sound and speaker diarization analysis" by Yannis Tevissen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a general overview of the research focus, but I need to look for specific datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will examine the **methodology section** (specifically section IV, "Proposed Speaker Diarization Approach") and the **results section** to identify any datasets used for evaluation. The authors mention evaluating their proposed methods, which often implies the use of specific datasets.

In the **data used and evaluation method section**, the authors describe the recordings used for their experiments. They mention that the data consists of short conversations recorded with 1 to 4 active speakers, lasting between 3 to 5 minutes. However, they do not provide a specific name for this dataset, which is crucial for proper citation.

I will also check the **references section** to see if any datasets are cited there that could be relevant to the experiments conducted in this paper. The references may include datasets used in previous studies that the authors built upon.

After reviewing the entire paper, I will compile the information regarding the datasets. Since the paper does not provide a specific dataset name, I will note that the authors used recordings of conversations but will not be able to provide a full citation for a dataset.

If I find any datasets mentioned in the references that are relevant to the study, I will extract their full citations. For example, if the authors refer to a specific dataset in their references, I will ensure to include that citation.

Finally, I will summarize the findings regarding the datasets, including any relevant citations, and prepare the information for structured output, ensuring that I maintain clarity and accuracy in the documentation of the datasets used in the research.
