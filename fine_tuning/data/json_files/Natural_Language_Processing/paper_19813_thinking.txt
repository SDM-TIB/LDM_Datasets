To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Greed is All You Need: An Evaluation of Tokenizer Inference Methods" by Omri Uzan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted an analysis using a novel intrinsic evaluation suite curated for English, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this paper, they mention several datasets in Table 2, which lists resources used in their benchmark. I will extract the names and details of these datasets from this table.

The datasets mentioned include:

1. **LADEC**: A large database of English compounds, with a size of 7,804 words.
2. **MorphoLex**: A derivational morphological database for 70,000 English words, with a size of 12,029.
3. **MorphyNet**: A multilingual database of derivational and inflectional morphology, with a size of 219,410.
4. **DagoBERT**: A dataset for generating derivational morphology with a pretrained language model, with a size of 279,443.
5. **UniMorph**: A universal morphology dataset, with a size of 143,454.
6. **UnBlend**: A dataset for analyzing blend structures, with a size of 312.
7. **CompoundPiece**: A dataset for evaluating and improving decompounding performance, with a size of 22,896.

Next, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. Here are the citations I found:

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described with its citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, along with the necessary references for further exploration.
