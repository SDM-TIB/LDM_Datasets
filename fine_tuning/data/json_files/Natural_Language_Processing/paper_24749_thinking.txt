To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Evaluating the Ability of LLMs to Solve Semantics-Aware Process Mining Tasks" by Adrian Rebmann et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and datasets section** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors provide extensive benchmarking datasets for three process mining tasks, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **Section IV (Datasets)**, where the authors describe the creation and characteristics of the datasets. Here, they mention a **corpus of process behaviors** and **task-specific benchmarking datasets**. I will extract the relevant details about each dataset mentioned:

1. **Corpus of Process Behaviors**: This corpus is based on the largest publicly available process model collection, SAP-SAM. It serves as the foundation for generating task-specific datasets.

2. **Task-Specific Benchmarking Datasets**: The authors outline three datasets corresponding to the tasks defined in the paper:
   - **T-SAD Dataset**: Contains 291,251 records for trace-level semantic anomaly detection.
   - **A-SAD Dataset**: Comprises 316,308 records for activity-level semantic anomaly detection.
   - **S-NAP Dataset**: Includes 1,289,081 records for semantic next activity prediction.

In the **characteristics section**, the authors provide details about the number of valid and anomalous instances for each dataset, which is crucial for understanding their structure and purpose.

Next, I will consult the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The authors reference the SAP-SAM collection, which is critical for the corpus, and they also provide a link to their published datasets.

The citation for the **SAP-SAM collection** is:
> D. Sola, C. Warmuth, B. Schäfer, P. Badakhshan, J.-R. Rehse, and T. Kampik. *SAP Signavio academic models: A large process model dataset*. In ICPM Workshops. Springer, 2023, pp. 453–465.

Additionally, the authors mention that their process behavior corpus and benchmarking datasets are published separately:
> A. Rebmann, F. D. Schmidt, G. Glavaš, and H. van der Aa. *Process behavior corpus and benchmarking datasets*. May 2024. [Online]. Available: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.11276246

Now, I will compile the extracted datasets and their citations into a structured format for further processing. This ensures that I have accurately captured all necessary information for each dataset mentioned in the paper.
