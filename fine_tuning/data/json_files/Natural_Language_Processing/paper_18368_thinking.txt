To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Decision Theoretic Foundations for Experiments Evaluating Human Decisions" by Jessica Hullman, Alex Kale, and Jason Hartline, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the study, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will look for specific sections that typically contain dataset information, such as **"Data Collection," "Experiments," or "Methodology."** In these sections, the authors may describe the datasets used for their experiments, including details about their sources, sizes, and characteristics.

As I read through these sections, I will take note of any datasets explicitly mentioned. For example, if the authors refer to a dataset used for evaluating human decision-making, I will record its name and any relevant details provided.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily. I will look for citations that provide the authors, title, publication venue, and year of publication.

If the paper mentions datasets that are derived from other studies or sources, I will ensure to cite the original sources as well. For instance, if a dataset is based on a previous study, I will include that study's citation in addition to the current paper's citation.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and ease of use.

In summary, my steps will be:
1. Read the abstract, introduction, and methodology sections for mentions of datasets.
2. Identify specific sections that discuss data collection or experiments.
3. Note down the names and details of the datasets mentioned.
4. Check the References section for full citations of each dataset.
5. Compile the information into a clear format for future reference.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and cite the datasets used in the research paper.
