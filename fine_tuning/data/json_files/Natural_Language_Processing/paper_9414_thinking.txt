To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Improving Energy Management of Hybrid Electric Vehicles by Considering Battery Electric-Thermal Model" by A. Mousaei, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, results, and conclusion sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will look for any mention of datasets used for simulations or experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to see if the author discusses any existing datasets or benchmarks that are relevant to the study. This section often provides context and may reference previous works that utilized specific datasets.

In the **methodology section**, I will look for details about the simulations conducted, including any datasets used for training or testing the energy management system. The author may describe the parameters or characteristics of the datasets, which will be crucial for my extraction.

I will also examine the **results section** to see if the author presents any data derived from specific datasets. This could include performance metrics or comparisons that rely on particular datasets.

Finally, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. This is critical, as I need to provide complete citations for each dataset extracted.

As I go through these sections, I will take note of any datasets mentioned, including their names, descriptions, and the context in which they were used. If the paper refers to datasets from other studies, I will ensure to cite those original sources accurately.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation as found in the references section of the paper.

By following this structured approach, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets relevant to the research presented in the paper.
