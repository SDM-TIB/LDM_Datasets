To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Classification Modeling with RNN-Based, Random Forest, and XGBoost for Imbalanced Data: A Case of Early Crash Detection in ASEAN-5 Stock Markets" by Deri Siswara et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the study analyzes daily data from 2010 to 2023 across the major stock markets of the ASEAN-5 countries, which suggests that there are datasets involved.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly where the authors describe the data collection process. Here, they mention that the data is sourced from Yahoo Finance and consists of daily stock prices from five markets (Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, and the Philippines). They also specify that the data is used to create a total of 15 datasets based on three Value at Risk (VaR) scenarios (5%, 2.5%, and 1%).

In the **results and discussion section**, the authors provide insights into the performance of various models on these datasets, which further confirms the existence of multiple datasets.

Now, I will compile the details of the datasets:

1. **ASEAN-5 Stock Market Datasets**: The paper discusses datasets derived from the five largest stock markets in the ASEAN-5 region, specifically:
   - **Indonesia Stock Market Dataset**
   - **Malaysia Stock Market Dataset**
   - **Singapore Stock Market Dataset**
   - **Thailand Stock Market Dataset**
   - **Philippines Stock Market Dataset**

Each of these datasets is created under three different VaR scenarios, leading to a total of 15 datasets (5 markets × 3 VaR scenarios).

Next, I will look for the full citations for the data source mentioned in the paper. The authors state that the data is publicly available from Yahoo Finance. Therefore, the citation for the dataset source is:

- **Yahoo Finance**: 
  > Yahoo Finance, “Yahoo Finance – stock market live, quotes, business & finance news,” Yahoo Finance. [Online]. Available: https://finance.yahoo.com/

Now that I have identified the datasets and their source, I will summarize the findings:

- **Datasets**:
  - **ASEAN-5 Stock Market Datasets** (15 datasets total):
    - Indonesia Stock Market Dataset (VaR scenarios: 5%, 2.5%, 1%)
    - Malaysia Stock Market Dataset (VaR scenarios: 5%, 2.5%, 1%)
    - Singapore Stock Market Dataset (VaR scenarios: 5%, 2.5%, 1%)
    - Thailand Stock Market Dataset (VaR scenarios: 5%, 2.5%, 1%)
    - Philippines Stock Market Dataset (VaR scenarios: 5%, 2.5%, 1%)

- **Full Citation for Data Source**:
  > Yahoo Finance, “Yahoo Finance – stock market live, quotes, business & finance news,” Yahoo Finance. [Online]. Available: https://finance.yahoo.com/

With this information, I am ready to create structured entries for each dataset as needed.
