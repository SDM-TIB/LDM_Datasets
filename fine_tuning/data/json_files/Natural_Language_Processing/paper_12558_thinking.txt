To extract datasets from the research paper titled "D2S: Representing local descriptors and global scene coordinates for camera relocalization" by Bach-Thuan Bui, Dinh-Tuan Tran, and Joo-Ho Lee, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors propose a new outdoor dataset to evaluate visual localization methods, which suggests that there is at least one dataset to extract.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors discuss their contributions, including the introduction of a new dataset for evaluating visual re-localizers under varying conditions. This section may provide more context about the dataset's purpose and characteristics.

In the **experiments section**, specifically section 4.1.2, the authors detail the datasets used for evaluation. They mention the following datasets:

1. **7-Scenes Dataset**: An RGB-D dataset of seven small-scale indoor environments, which includes ground truth camera poses and depth channels for generating scene coordinates. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Jamie Shotton, Ben Glocker, Christopher Zach, Shahram Izadi, Antonio Criminisi, and Andrew Fitzgibbon. *Scene coordinate regression forests for camera relocalization in rgb-d images*. In Proceedings of the IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pages 2930–2937, 2013.

2. **Indoor6 Dataset**: A non-stationary dataset with images captured in larger environments at different times and days, featuring strong illumination variations. The citation is:
   > Tien Do, Ondrej Miksik, Joseph DeGol, Hyun Soo Park, and Sudipta N Sinha. *Learning to detect scene landmarks for camera localization*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 11132–11142, 2022.

3. **Cambridge Landmarks Dataset**: An RGB outdoor dataset used for localization, with ground truth camera poses obtained through SfM reconstruction. The citation is:
   > Alex Kendall, Matthew Grimes, and Roberto Cipolla. *PoseNet: A convolutional network for real-time 6-dof camera relocalization*. In Proceedings of the IEEE international conference on computer vision, pages 2938–2946, 2015.

4. **Ritsumeikan BKC Dataset**: A new outdoor RGB dataset introduced by the authors for evaluating generalization capabilities of visual localization methods. Since this is a new dataset proposed in the paper, it may not have a formal citation yet, but I will note it as follows:
   > Bui, B.-T., Tran, D.-T., & Lee, J.-H. *Ritsumeikan BKC Dataset for visual localization*. (2023).

After identifying these datasets, I will ensure to compile their details and citations accurately. This will involve confirming the citations from the references section of the paper to ensure they are complete and correctly formatted.

Finally, I will summarize the extracted datasets, including their names, descriptions, and citations, in a structured format for easy reference.
