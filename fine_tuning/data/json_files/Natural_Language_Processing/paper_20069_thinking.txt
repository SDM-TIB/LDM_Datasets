To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DITTO: Dual and Integrated Latent Topologies for Implicit 3D Reconstruction" by Jaehyeok Shim and Kyungdon Joo, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to look for any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that DITTO outperforms previous methods on object- and scene-level datasets, which suggests that specific datasets are used for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors typically provide detailed information about the datasets used in their experiments. In this section, I will look for explicit mentions of dataset names and any relevant details about their characteristics.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find the following datasets mentioned:

1. **ShapeNet Dataset**: This dataset is used for object-level surface reconstruction and contains 13 categories of object watertight meshes. The authors mention that they follow the same train/val/test splits as previous works for fair comparison.

2. **Synthetic Rooms Dataset**: This dataset is utilized for scene-level surface reconstruction and consists of 5,000 synthetically created rooms using objects from ShapeNet. The authors also note that they adhere to the conventional train/val/test splits for this dataset.

3. **ScanNet-v2 Dataset**: This dataset contains 1,513 scene scans and is used to evaluate the generality of the proposed method. The authors mention that this dataset was not used during training, which adds to the robustness of their evaluation.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **ShapeNet**, the citation is:
  > Angel X Chang, Thomas Funkhouser, Leonidas Guibas, Pat Hanrahan, Qixing Huang, Zimo Li, Silvio Savarese, Manolis Savva, Shuran Song, Hao Su, et al. *ShapeNet: An information-rich 3D model repository*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1512.03012, 2015.

- For **Synthetic Rooms**, the citation is:
  > Songyou Peng, Michael Niemeyer, Lars Mescheder, Marc Pollefeys, and Andreas Geiger. *Convolutional occupancy networks*. In Proceedings of the European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), 2020.

- For **ScanNet-v2**, the citation is:
  > Angela Dai, Angel X Chang, Manolis Savva, Maciej Halber, Thomas Funkhouser, and Matthias Nie√üner. *ScanNet: Richly-annotated 3D reconstructions of indoor scenes*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2017.

With the dataset names and their citations collected, I will now prepare to format this information according to the required structure for further processing or review.
