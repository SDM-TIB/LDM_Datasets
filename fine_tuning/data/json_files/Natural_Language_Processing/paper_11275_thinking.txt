To extract datasets from the research paper titled "K-Nearest-Neighbor Resampling for Off-Policy Evaluation in Stochastic Control" by Michael Giegrich et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract discusses a novel K-nearest neighbor resampling procedure for off-policy evaluation, but does not explicitly mention any datasets. The introduction may provide more context or specific datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section 4) closely, as this is where datasets are typically detailed. I will look for any tables or figures that summarize the datasets used in the experiments. In this paper, the authors mention three stochastic control environments: 

1. **Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR)**: This environment is described in detail, but it does not specify a dataset in the traditional sense. Instead, it outlines the parameters and dynamics of the environment used for evaluation.

2. **Optimal Execution in Limit Order Book Markets**: Similar to the LQR, this section describes the environment and its parameters but does not reference a specific dataset.

3. **Online Stochastic Bin Packing**: Again, this section details the environment and its parameters without citing a specific dataset.

Since the paper does not reference any external datasets but rather describes environments created for the experiments, I will note that the datasets are effectively the simulated environments themselves.

Next, I will check the **References section** to see if any foundational datasets or prior works are cited that could be relevant. However, it appears that the paper primarily focuses on the methodologies and environments created for the experiments rather than using established datasets.

Finally, I will compile the information I have gathered. Since there are no traditional datasets with citations, I will summarize the environments used in the experiments and note that they are based on simulations rather than external datasets.

In conclusion, I will document the following:

- **Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR)**: A simulated environment based on the dynamics described in the paper.
- **Optimal Execution in Limit Order Book Markets**: A simulated environment with specific parameters outlined.
- **Online Stochastic Bin Packing**: Another simulated environment with detailed dynamics.

Since there are no formal citations for datasets, I will note that the environments are constructed for the purpose of the experiments and do not reference external datasets.

This approach ensures that I accurately capture the essence of the datasets (or lack thereof) as presented in the paper.
