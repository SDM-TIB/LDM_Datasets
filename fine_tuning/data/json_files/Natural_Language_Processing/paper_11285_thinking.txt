To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Computational Analysis of Oral Argument in the Supreme Court" by Gregory M. Dickinson, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract and introduction** sections of the paper. These sections often provide a summary of the research and may mention any datasets used. In this case, the introduction discusses the analysis of oral argument transcripts, which suggests that there may be datasets related to these transcripts.

Next, I will look into **section I (The Data)**, which is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets used in the study. Here, the author describes the sources of the data, including the Supreme Court oral argument transcripts and the Oyez Project's audio recordings. The section specifies that the dataset includes transcripts from nearly 1,400 cases argued and decided from 1998 to 2015, which is a significant dataset for analysis.

I will also check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper references the Supreme Court Database (SCDB) as a source of case outcome and Court composition data. I will need to ensure I capture the correct citation for this database.

The citations I will extract are as follows:

1. **Supreme Court Oral Argument Transcripts**:
   > Official transcripts of Supreme Court arguments are available on the Courtâ€™s website in PDF format. The dataset includes transcripts from 2004 onwards, when individual Justices were identified by name.

2. **Oyez Project**:
   > The Oyez Project at Chicago-Kent College of Law has analyzed audio recordings of oral arguments and matched questions with particular Justices in oral argument transcripts for an additional six years, dating back to 1998.

3. **Supreme Court Database (SCDB)**:
   > The Supreme Court Database (SCDB) is a widely used source of expertly coded data on the Supreme Court, which includes case outcome and Court composition data.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes a clear description of the dataset along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
