To extract datasets from the research paper titled "TDANet: Target-Directed Attention Network For Object-Goal Visual Navigation With Zero-Shot Ability" by Shiwei Lian and Feitian Zhang, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the proposed TDANet is evaluated in the **AI2-THOR embodied AI environment**, which suggests that this environment may be a dataset or a platform used for experiments.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this section, the authors describe conducting extensive experiments in the **AI2-THOR** environment, which contains 120 near photo-realistic indoor room scenes. They mention that the training set consists of the first 20 rooms from each room type (kitchen, bedroom, living room, and bathroom), while the test set includes the remaining 10 rooms from each type. This indicates that the AI2-THOR environment is indeed a dataset used for their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the AI2-THOR dataset. The relevant citation is:

- **AI2-THOR**: 
  > E. Kolve, R. Mottaghi, W. Han, E. VanderBilt, L. Weihs, A. Herrasti, M. Deitke, K. Ehsani, D. Gordon, Y. Zhu, A. Kembhavi, A. K. Gupta, and A. Farhadi. "Ai2-thor: An interactive 3d environment for visual ai." 2017, arXiv:1712.05474.

Since the paper primarily focuses on the AI2-THOR environment for its experiments, I will compile the dataset entry for this dataset.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry according to the required format, ensuring that the full citation is included for the AI2-THOR dataset. This will ensure that the information is complete and ready for further processing or review.
