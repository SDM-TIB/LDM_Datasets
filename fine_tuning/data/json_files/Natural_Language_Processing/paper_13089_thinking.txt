To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Bias in Machine Learning: A Comprehensive Review" by Agnieszka Miko≈Çajczyk, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

1. **Read the Abstract and Introduction**: I will start by examining the abstract and introduction sections of the paper. These sections often provide a summary of the research focus and may mention specific datasets used in the study. I will look for any explicit references to datasets or data sources.

2. **Identify Sections Related to Datasets**: Next, I will navigate to sections that typically discuss datasets, such as "Datasets," "Methodology," or "Experiments." These sections usually contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used, including their characteristics, sizes, and any preprocessing steps taken.

3. **Extract Dataset Information**: In the relevant sections, I will extract the names of the datasets, their descriptions, and any specific details provided by the authors. For example, if the paper discusses a skin lesion dataset, I will note the dataset's name, the number of images, and any relevant annotations or features.

4. **Check the References Section**: After identifying the datasets, I will consult the references section of the paper to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily.

5. **Compile Dataset Citations**: I will compile the full citations for each dataset, ensuring to include all necessary details such as authors, title, publication venue, and year. This will provide a comprehensive reference for each dataset used in the research.

6. **Summarize Findings**: Finally, I will summarize my findings, clearly listing each dataset along with its citation. This summary will serve as a quick reference for anyone interested in the datasets used in the study.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and cite the datasets from the research paper, maintaining the integrity of the information and providing proper credit to the original sources.
