To extract datasets from the research paper titled "WorDepth: Variational Language Prior for Monocular Depth Estimation" by Ziyao Zeng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors demonstrate their approach on indoor (NYUv2) and outdoor (KITTI) scenarios, suggesting that these are the datasets used.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors explicitly mention the datasets. In the experiments, they state: "We evaluate our method on indoor (NYU Depth V2) and outdoor (KITTI) scenarios." This confirms that both datasets are utilized in their evaluation.

I will then look for detailed descriptions of these datasets within the paper. The authors provide specific information about each dataset:

1. **NYU Depth V2**: This dataset contains 480×640 images with depth values ranging from 1 × 10^-3 to 10 meters. The authors mention that they follow a specific partition for training and testing, which includes 24,231 training images and 654 test images.

2. **KITTI**: This dataset consists of 352×1216 images with depth values from 1 × 10^-3 to 80 meters. The authors adopt the Eigen Split, which includes 23,488 training images and 697 testing images.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **NYU Depth V2**, the citation is:
  > Nathan Silberman, Derek Hoiem, Pushmeet Kohli, and Rob Fergus. *Indoor segmentation and support inference from RGBD images*. In Computer Vision–ECCV 2012: 12th European Conference on Computer Vision, Florence, Italy, October 7-13, 2012, Proceedings, Part V, pages 746–760. Springer, 2012.

- For **KITTI**, the citation is:
  > Andreas Geiger, Philip Lenz, and Raquel Urtasun. *Are we ready for autonomous driving? The KITTI vision benchmark suite*. In 2012 IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pages 3354–3361. IEEE, 2012.

With this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
