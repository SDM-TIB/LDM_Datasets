To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Code quality assessment using transformers" by Mosleh Mahamud and Isak Samsten, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental evaluation sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors experimented with a "novel dataset for code quality assessment," which suggests that a specific dataset is being introduced.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental evaluation section** where the authors describe their dataset in detail. They mention that the dataset consists of programming solutions for a JavaFX task completed by 250 students, which corresponds to more than 25,000 Java methods. They also explain that domain experts assigned quality scores to these methods based on intrinsic qualities like elegance and readability.

The authors state that they labeled 2,500 methods and partitioned them into three parts for training, validation, and testing. This detailed description confirms that this dataset is central to their research.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. However, since this dataset appears to be novel and created by the authors themselves, it may not have a formal citation like established datasets. Instead, I will note that the dataset is available at their supporting GitHub repository, which is provided in the conclusion.

The relevant information I will compile includes:

1. **Dataset Name**: JavaFX Programming Assignment Dataset
   - **Description**: A dataset consisting of programming solutions for a JavaFX task completed by 250 students, containing over 25,000 Java methods. Each method is scored by domain experts based on quality attributes such as elegance and readability.
   - **Citation**: The dataset is available at the GitHub repository: [https://github.com/mosh98/AutoGrade](https://github.com/mosh98/AutoGrade).

After gathering this information, I will prepare to format it according to the specified structure, ensuring that the dataset's details and citation are accurately represented for future reference or analysis.
