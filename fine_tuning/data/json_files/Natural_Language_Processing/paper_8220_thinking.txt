To extract datasets from the research paper titled "lo-fi: distributed fine-tuning without communication" by Mitchell Wortsman et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions fine-tuning on **ImageNet** and **Common Crawl**, which indicates that these are likely datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** in detail, particularly focusing on the subsections where the authors describe their methodology and results. In the **3.1 Fine-tuning DeiT-III on ImageNet** subsection, the authors explicitly state that they fine-tune the **DeiT-base** and **DeiT-large** models on **ImageNet-1k**. This confirms that **ImageNet-1k** is a dataset used in their experiments.

In the **3.3 Language model fine-tuning** subsection, the authors mention fine-tuning **OPT-125M** and **OPT-1.3B** on **Common Crawl**. This indicates that **Common Crawl** is another dataset utilized in their research.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For **ImageNet**, the citation is:
   > Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, and Li Fei-Fei. *ImageNet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2009. https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5206848.

2. For **Common Crawl**, the citation is:
   > Common Crawl. *Common Crawl: A repository of web crawl data*. Available at: https://commoncrawl.org/.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented and properly cited.
