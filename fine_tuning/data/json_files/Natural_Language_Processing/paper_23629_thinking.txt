To extract datasets from the research paper titled "OFDM-Standard Compatible SC-NOFS Waveforms for Low-Latency and Jitter-Tolerance Industrial IoT Communications" by Tongyang Xu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and while it may not explicitly mention datasets, it can hint at the types of data used.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments and results sections**. These sections typically contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used for validation and testing. I will look for any specific names of datasets, their characteristics, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

In this paper, the authors discuss the performance evaluation of their proposed SC-NOFS signal framework. They mention using a **hardware prototyping setup** and reference various performance metrics, but I need to check if they explicitly mention any datasets or benchmarks used for comparison.

I will also check the **references section** to see if any datasets are cited. Often, datasets are associated with specific studies or benchmarks, and the authors may provide citations for these datasets.

After reviewing the relevant sections, I will compile the information about each dataset, including its name, description, and the full citation. If the paper mentions any datasets used in experiments, I will ensure to include the complete citation for each dataset, as this is crucial for proper attribution.

Finally, I will summarize the findings in a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described with its citation, ready for further processing or review.
