To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Mimic: Speaking Style Disentanglement for Speech-Driven 3D Facial Animation" by Hui Fu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that extensive experiments were conducted on three publicly available datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly the subsection titled **Datasets and Implementations**. Here, the authors mention that they conducted experiments on a larger dataset called **3D-HDTF**, which is based on a high-quality 2D audio-visual dataset called **HDTF**. They also reference two other datasets, **VOCASET** and **BIWI**, which are commonly used in previous works.

In the **Datasets and Implementations** section, the authors provide detailed information about the **3D-HDTF dataset**:
- **3D-HDTF Dataset**: This dataset consists of 220 paired audio-mesh sequences of 160 identities with over 3,000 sentences and corresponding 160 template meshes. The dataset is split into training and testing sets, with specific sequences designated for each.

The authors also mention the other datasets:
- **VOCASET**: Referenced as a dataset used in previous works, but no specific details are provided in this paper.
- **BIWI Dataset**: Similarly referenced without detailed information.

Now, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for future researchers.

1. For the **3D-HDTF dataset**, the citation is:
   > Zhang, Z., Li, L., Ding, Y., & Fan, C. (2021). Flow-guided One-shot Talking Face Generation with a High-resolution Audio-visual Dataset. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 3661–3670.

2. For the **VOCASET**, the citation is:
   > Cudeiro, D., Bolkart, T., Laidlaw, C., Ranjan, A., & Black, M. J. (2019). Capture, Learning, and Synthesis of 3D Speaking Styles. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 10101–10111.

3. For the **BIWI dataset**, the citation is:
   > Fanelli, G., Gall, J., Romsdorfer, H., Weise, T., & Van Gool, L. (2010). A 3D Audio-Visual Corpus of Affective Communication. IEEE Transactions on Multimedia, 12(6), 591–598.

With this information, I can now compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, facilitating further exploration and validation of the findings presented in the paper.
