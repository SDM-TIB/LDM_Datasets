To extract datasets from the research paper titled "AI as a Tool for Fair Journalism: Case Studies from Malta" by Dylan Seychell et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the projects, indicating that they involve media monitoring and bias analysis, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

Next, I will focus on **Section III (Proposed AI in Journalism Tools)**, where the authors describe two main projects. The first project analyzes news articles, and the second project analyzes news videos. I will look for specific mentions of datasets used in these projects.

In the **News Articles Analysis** subsection, the authors mention that they used data from **six online newspapers**: The Times of Malta (ToM), The Shift (TS), Malta Today (MT), The Malta Independent (MI), Malta Daily (MD), and Gozo News (GN). They specify that the dataset includes **800 news articles from each newspaper**, collected on April 5, 2023. This is a clear dataset that I need to document.

In the **News Video Analysis** subsection, the authors describe a new dataset of **215 news segment videos** from TVM news, totaling **8.48 hours** of footage. This dataset includes annotations for named persons in captions, which is crucial for their analysis. 

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. However, the datasets themselves (the articles and videos) do not have formal citations like traditional datasets might. Instead, I will provide a description of the datasets along with the context in which they were used.

For the **News Articles Dataset**, I will summarize it as follows:
- **Dataset Name**: News Articles Dataset
- **Description**: A collection of 4,800 articles from six Maltese newspapers, focusing on bias analysis in news content.
- **Citation**: Seychell, D., Hili, G., Attard, J., & Makantatis, K. (2024). AI as a Tool for Fair Journalism: Case Studies from Malta. In Proceedings of the IEEE 2024 Conference on Artificial Intelligence (CAI 2024).

For the **News Video Dataset**, I will summarize it as follows:
- **Dataset Name**: News Video Dataset
- **Description**: A curated dataset of 215 news segment videos from TVM news, annotated with timestamps, names, and visibility flags for named individuals.
- **Citation**: Seychell, D., Hili, G., Attard, J., & Makantatis, K. (2024). AI as a Tool for Fair Journalism: Case Studies from Malta. In Proceedings of the IEEE 2024 Conference on Artificial Intelligence (CAI 2024).

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their context within the research paper.
