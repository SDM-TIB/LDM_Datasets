To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Quantized Side Tuning: Fast and Memory-Efficient Tuning of Quantized Large Language Models" by Zhengxin Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of the proposed method, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for evaluation. They state that they evaluate the performance of their method on the **GLUE** and **MMLU** benchmarks. This indicates that these are the datasets of interest.

In the **GLUE benchmark** section, the authors describe it as a comprehensive evaluation platform for various linguistic tasks, which includes several specific tasks such as CoLA, SST-2, MRPC, QQP, and MNLI. Each of these tasks is part of the GLUE dataset.

For the **MMLU benchmark**, the authors mention that it consists of 57 tasks across various domains, including elementary mathematics, US history, and computer science. However, they do not provide specific task names in this section.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. **GLUE Benchmark**:
   - The citation for the GLUE benchmark is:
     > Alex Wang, Amanpreet Singh, Julian Michael, Felix Hill, Omer Levy, and Samuel R Bowman. *GLUE: A multi-task benchmark and analysis platform for natural language understanding*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1804.07461, 2018.

2. **MMLU Benchmark**:
   - The citation for the MMLU benchmark is:
     > Dan Hendrycks, Collin Burns, Steven Basart, Andy Zou, Mantas Mazeika, Dawn Song, and Jacob Steinhardt. *Measuring massive multitask language understanding*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2009.03300, 2020.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its respective citation.
