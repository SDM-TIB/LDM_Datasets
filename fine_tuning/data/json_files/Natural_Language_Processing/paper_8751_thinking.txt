To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Can Machine Learning discover the determining factors in participation in insurance schemes? A comparative analysis" by Biagini Luigi and Severini Simone, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study relies on individual farm data from FADN from 2016 to 2019, which suggests that this dataset is crucial for the analysis.

Next, in the **methodology section**, the authors specify that they used individual data from the Italian FADN (Farm Accountancy Data Network) focusing on field crop farms, yielding 10,926 observations. This is a clear indication of the dataset being utilized for their analysis.

I will also look for any additional datasets mentioned in the **results section** or throughout the paper. However, the primary dataset appears to be the FADN data, as it is the main source for the analysis of factors affecting insurance participation.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the FADN dataset. Since the FADN is a well-known dataset, it may not have a specific citation in the same way that academic papers do. However, I can provide a general reference to the FADN as follows:

- For the **FADN dataset**, the citation is:
  > European Commission. *Farm Accountancy Data Network (FADN)*. Available at: [https://ec.europa.eu/info/food-farming-fisheries/key-policies/common-agricultural-policy/rural-development/farm-accountancy-data-network_en](https://ec.europa.eu/info/food-farming-fisheries/key-policies/common-agricultural-policy/rural-development/farm-accountancy-data-network_en).

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format that highlights the dataset's name, description, and citation, ensuring that it is ready for review or further processing.
