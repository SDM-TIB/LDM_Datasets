To extract datasets from the research paper titled "L4Q: Parameter Efficient Quantization-Aware Training on Large Language Models via LoRA-wise LSQ" by Hyesung Jeon et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions experiments conducted on the LLaMA and LLaMA2 model families using an instructional dataset, which suggests that there is a dataset involved.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. In section 4.1, the authors state that they trained their models on the **Stanford-Alpaca dataset**, which provides 52,000 sets of instruction-following data obtained from the instruction-tuned GPT-3.5 model. This is a clear identification of a dataset used in their experiments.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the Stanford-Alpaca dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Taori, R., Gulrajani, I., Zhang, T., Dubois, Y., Li, X., Guestrin, C., Liang, P., & Hashimoto, T. B. (2023). *Stanford Alpaca: An instruction-following LLaMA model*. GitHub. 

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the findings:

1. **Stanford-Alpaca Dataset**: This dataset consists of 52,000 instruction-following data sets derived from the instruction-tuned GPT-3.5 model.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This step-by-step approach ensures that I accurately capture the datasets and their citations from the research paper.
