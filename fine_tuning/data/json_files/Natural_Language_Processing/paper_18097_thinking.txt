To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MAMBA: Multi-level Aggregation via Memory Bank for Video Object Detection" by Guanxiong Sun et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors conducted extensive evaluations on the **ImageNet VID dataset**, which indicates that this dataset is likely important for their research.

Next, I will check the **experiments section** where the authors describe their evaluation methodology. They mention using the **ImageNet VID dataset**, which contains 3,862 training and 555 validation videos. This dataset is crucial for understanding the performance of their proposed method.

I will also look for any additional datasets mentioned in the paper. However, based on the provided text, it appears that the **ImageNet VID dataset** is the primary dataset used for evaluation.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citation for the **ImageNet VID dataset**. The relevant citation is:

- **ImageNet VID dataset**:
  > Russakovsky, O., Deng, J., Su, H., Krause, J., Satheesh, S., Ma, S., Huang, Z., Karpathy, A., Khosla, A., Bernstein, M., et al. (2015). *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 115(3), 211â€“252.

With this information, I will summarize the dataset details:

1. **ImageNet VID Dataset**: This dataset is used for video object detection and contains 3,862 training and 555 validation videos.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format for further processing, ensuring that I include the full citation as required. This methodical approach ensures that I accurately capture all relevant datasets and their citations from the research paper.
