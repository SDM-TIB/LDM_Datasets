To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CenTime: Event-Conditional Modelling of Censoring in Survival Analysis" by Ahmed H. Shahin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and while it may not detail specific datasets, it sets the context for the research. The introduction often discusses the background and may reference datasets used in prior studies, which could lead me to the datasets relevant to this paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Dataset and preprocessing)**, as this section is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets used in the experiments. Here, the authors mention using the **Open Source Imaging Consortium (OSIC)** dataset, which includes lung CT scans and clinical data related to Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF). The section provides specifics about the dataset, including the number of samples (728) and the division into training, validation, and test sets.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the OSIC dataset. Since the dataset is mentioned as part of a larger consortium, I will look for the appropriate citation that describes the dataset comprehensively.

The citation for the OSIC dataset is:
> Open Source Imaging Consortium. *OSIC Dataset*. Available at: https://www.osicild.org/dr-about.html.

Now, I will summarize the findings:

1. **Open Source Imaging Consortium (OSIC) Dataset**: This dataset encompasses lung CT scans along with contemporaneous clinical data and mortality labels. It consists of 728 samples, which were randomly divided into training (70%), validation (15%), and test (15%) sets.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry with the full citation, ensuring that it is ready for downstream processing or review. This structured approach ensures that I capture all relevant details about the dataset used in the research paper.
