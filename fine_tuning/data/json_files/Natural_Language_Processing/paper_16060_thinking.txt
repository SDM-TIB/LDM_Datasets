To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-Step Dialogue Workflow Action Prediction" by Ramya Ramakrishnan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract mentions the problem of multi-step workflow action prediction and hints at the use of datasets for training and evaluation. The introduction elaborates on the context of task-oriented dialogue and may provide insights into specific datasets used.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly discuss the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention two datasets:

1. **ABCD Dataset**: This dataset contains over 10,000 conversations between two human users, covering 55 user intents in the customer service domain. It is noted for its workflow-guided conversations.

2. **MultiWoz Dataset**: This dataset also contains more than 10,000 dialogues and is commonly used in task-oriented dialogue research. It has workflows constructed by previous work, which are utilized as ground truth for training.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **ABCD Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Chen, D., Chen, H., Yang, Y., Lin, A., & Yu, Z. (2021). Action-based conversations dataset: A corpus for building more in-depth task-oriented dialogue systems. arXiv preprint arXiv:2104.00783.

- For the **MultiWoz Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Budzianowski, P., & Vulić, I. (2018). Multiwoz–a large-scale multi-domain wizard-of-oz dataset for task-oriented dialogue modelling. arXiv preprint arXiv:1810.00278.

Now that I have the dataset names and their corresponding citations, I will summarize the findings and prepare to format them according to the required structure, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its citation.
