To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Meta-prompting Optimized Retrieval-augmented Generation" by João Rodrigues and António Branco, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the method was tested on the **StrategyQA dataset**, which is a strong indication that this dataset is crucial for the experiments.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Datasets and models)**, where the authors explicitly discuss the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention the **StrategyQA dataset** in detail, describing its structure and purpose. The dataset contains 2,780 queries associated with related content and answers, specifically designed for multi-hop question answering tasks.

I will also look for any additional datasets mentioned in the paper. However, it appears that the **StrategyQA dataset** is the primary dataset utilized for the experiments, as it is the only one explicitly detailed in the context of their evaluation.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the **StrategyQA dataset**. The citation provided in the references is:
> Geva, M., Khashabi, D., Segal, E., Khot, T., Roth, D., & Berant, J. (2021). Did Aristotle use a laptop? A question answering benchmark with implicit reasoning strategies. *Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics*, 9, 346–361.

With this information, I can summarize the dataset extraction process:

1. Identify the relevant sections of the paper that discuss datasets (abstract, introduction, methods).
2. Locate the specific dataset mentioned (StrategyQA dataset).
3. Gather details about the dataset's structure and purpose from the methods section.
4. Retrieve the full citation from the references section.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format for further processing or review.
