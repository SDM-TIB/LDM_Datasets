To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Real-World Focus Stacking with Deep Learning" by Alexandre Araujo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions a new dataset consisting of **94 high-resolution bursts of raw images with focus bracketing**, which is a strong indication that this dataset is central to the research. The introduction further elaborates on the challenges of existing datasets and emphasizes the significance of their new dataset.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any section that discusses datasets in detail. In this paper, the relevant information is found in **section 3 (Datasets & Methods)**. Here, the authors describe their dataset, referred to as the **Large-Scale Focus Dataset (LSFD)**, which consists of 94 bursts, each containing 30 high-resolution raw images. They also mention that the pseudo ground truth for this dataset is computed using **HeliconFocus**, a state-of-the-art focus stacking software.

I will also check the **experiments section** to confirm the usage of the LSFD in their experiments, which is indeed mentioned, reinforcing its importance in their study.

Now, I need to gather the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper provides a reference for **HeliconFocus** in the references section, which is crucial for citing the pseudo ground truth generation method. The citation is as follows:

- **HeliconFocus**:
  > D Kozub, V Khmelik, Yu Shapoval, V Chentsov, S Yatsenko, B Litovchenko, and V Starykh. *Helicon focus software*, 2008.

Since the LSFD is a new dataset introduced by the authors, I will create a citation for it based on the information provided in the paper. The citation can be formatted as follows:

- **Large-Scale Focus Dataset (LSFD)**:
  > Alexandre Araujo, Jean Ponce, Julien Mairal. *Towards Real-World Focus Stacking with Deep Learning*. In Proceedings of the [Conference Name], [Year]. [Link to the dataset if available].

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. This includes the dataset name, description, and full citation for each dataset mentioned in the paper.
