To extract datasets from the research paper titled "AI in Thyroid Cancer Diagnosis: Techniques, Trends, and Future Directions" by Yassine Habchi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract provides a general overview, and I will look for specific phrases that indicate the presence of datasets used in the research.

Next, I will focus on **Section III (Thyroid Cancer Datasets)**, which is likely to contain detailed descriptions of the datasets utilized in the study. I will carefully note the names of each dataset, their characteristics, and any relevant statistics provided by the authors.

In this section, the authors mention several datasets, including:

1. **Digital Database Thyroid Image (DDTI)**: This dataset was developed to assist researchers and radiologists in creating computer-aided diagnosis systems for thyroid nodule analysis. It consists of 99 cases and 134 images, with patient data stored in XML format.

2. **The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)**: A comprehensive collection of genomic, epigenomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic data from over 11,000 cancer patients, which has been instrumental in cancer research.

3. **Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO)**: A genomics repository that stores gene expression datasets and provides access to a vast collection of experimental results.

4. **Thyroid Disease Data Set (TDDS)**: This dataset features 3772 training instances and 3428 testing instances, with a combination of categorical and real attributes for classifying thyroid conditions.

5. **Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)**: This dataset includes clinical characteristics from thyroid carcinoma patients, providing valuable epidemiological data.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations I will extract include:

- **Digital Database Thyroid Image (DDTI)**: 
  > Universidad Nacional de Colombia, CIM@LAB, and Instituto de Diagnostico Medico (IDIME). *Digital Database Thyroid Image*. Available online: http://cimalab.intec.co/?lang=en&mod=project&id=31.

- **The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)**: 
  > The Cancer Genome Atlas. *The Cancer Genome Atlas Data Portal*. Available online: https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/.

- **Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO)**: 
  > Gene Expression Omnibus. *Gene Expression Omnibus*. Available online: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/.

- **Thyroid Disease Data Set (TDDS)**: 
  > UCI Machine Learning Repository. *Thyroid Disease Data Set*. Available online: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/thyroid+disease.

- **Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)**: 
  > National Cancer Institute. *Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program*. Available online: http://www.ncin.org.uk/about_ncin/.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information and their citations into a structured format for easy reference and use in future research or applications. This systematic approach ensures that I accurately capture all relevant datasets and their citations from the paper.
