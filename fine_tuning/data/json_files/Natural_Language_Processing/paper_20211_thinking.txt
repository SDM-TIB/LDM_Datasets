To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Integrated SWIPT Receiver with Memory Effects: Circuit Analysis and Information Detection" by Eleni Demarchou et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on wireless power transfer and circuit analysis, but it does not mention specific datasets.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any references to datasets used in the experiments. The introduction discusses various models and approaches related to energy harvesting and wireless power transfer but does not specify any datasets.

I will then look into the **methodology and results sections** to identify if the authors conducted experiments that utilized specific datasets. However, the paper primarily focuses on theoretical analysis and circuit modeling rather than empirical data derived from specific datasets.

Since the paper does not explicitly mention any datasets used for experiments or simulations, I will check the **references section** to see if any datasets are cited indirectly through the works referenced. The references include various studies and theses related to wireless power transfer and energy harvesting, but they do not provide specific datasets.

After reviewing the entire paper, it appears that there are no datasets explicitly mentioned or utilized in the research. Therefore, I will conclude that there are no datasets to extract from this paper.

In summary, I will document my findings as follows:

1. **No datasets were identified in the paper.**
2. **No specific citations for datasets can be provided.**

This process highlights the importance of thoroughly reviewing each section of a research paper to identify any datasets, even if they are not explicitly stated. In this case, the focus was more on theoretical modeling rather than empirical data collection.
