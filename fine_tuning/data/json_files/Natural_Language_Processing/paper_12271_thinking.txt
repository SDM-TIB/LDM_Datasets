To extract datasets from the research paper titled "TractCloud: Registration-free Tractography Parcellation" by Tengfei Xue et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors trained their framework on a "large-scale labeled tractography dataset" and tested it on "five independently acquired datasets." This suggests that there are multiple datasets to extract.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for more details about the datasets. The introduction discusses the challenges of tractography and mentions the need for labeled data, but it does not provide specific dataset names.

I will then focus on **section 2.1 (Training and Testing Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used. Here, they mention:

1. **Training Dataset**: A high-quality dataset of 1 million labeled streamlines derived from a white matter tractography atlas curated by a neuroanatomist, based on 100 registered tractographies from the Human Connectome Project (HCP).

2. **Testing Datasets**: The authors list five datasets used for evaluation:
   - **developing HCP (dHCP)**: 20 neonates (1 to 27 days).
   - **Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD)**: 25 adolescents (9 to 11 years).
   - **HCP dataset**: 25 young healthy adults (22 to 35 years).
   - **Parkinson’s Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI)**: 25 older adults (51 to 75 years), including Parkinson’s disease patients and healthy individuals.
   - **Brain Tumor Patient (BTP)**: dMRI data from 25 brain tumor patients (28 to 70 years).

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **Human Connectome Project (HCP)**, the citation is:
  > Van Essen, D.C., et al. *The WU-Minn human connectome project: an overview*. Neuroimage 80, 62–79, 2013.

- For the **developing HCP (dHCP)**, the citation is:
  > Edwards, A.D., et al. *The developing human connectome project neonatal data release*. Front. Neurosci. 16, 886772, 2022.

- For the **Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD)** dataset, the citation is:
  > Volkow, N.D., et al. *The conception of the ABCD study: From substance use to a broad NIH collaboration*. Dev. Cogn. Neurosci. 32, 4–7, 2018.

- For the **Parkinson’s Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI)**, the citation is:
  > Marek, K., et al. *The parkinson progression marker initiative (PPMI)*. Prog. Neurobiol. 95(4), 629–635, 2011.

- For the **Brain Tumor Patient (BTP)** dataset, there is no specific citation provided in the references, but it is mentioned that the data was acquired at Brigham and Women’s Hospital.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations.
