To extract datasets from the research paper titled "XAIport: A Service Framework for the Early Adoption of XAI in AI Model Development" by Zerui Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a high-level overview, and while it may not list specific datasets, it may hint at their use in experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors describe their pilot evaluation. In this section, they mention using the **ImageNet dataset** for their experiments. This is a crucial dataset for image classification tasks, and I need to gather more details about it.

I will also check the **related works section** and any other sections that might reference datasets used in previous studies or comparisons. However, the primary dataset mentioned for their evaluation is the ImageNet dataset.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citation for the ImageNet dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:

- For **ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, and Li Fei-Fei. *ImageNet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In 2009 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 248â€“255, 2009. https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2009.5206848

Since the paper primarily discusses the use of the ImageNet dataset, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity.

Finally, I will ensure that I have accurately documented the dataset name, description, and full citation, ready for any further processing or review.
