To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Routing to the Expert: Efficient Reward-guided Ensemble of Large Language Models" by Keming Lu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions evaluating ZOOTER on a comprehensive benchmark collection with 26 subsets, which suggests that there are datasets involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the complementary potential of LLMs and the need for efficient routing strategies, but they do not explicitly mention datasets. I will need to look further into the methods and experimental setup for specific dataset names.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe their experimental setup. Here, they mention creating a diverse mix instruction dataset called **DIVINSTRUCT**, which is derived from 13 different datasets. This is a key dataset that I need to document.

The paper also lists the composition of **DIVINSTRUCT** in **Table 3**, which includes various datasets such as:

1. **ultrachat**: 18,588 samples
2. **sharedgpt**: 10,432 samples
3. **wizardlm (sharedgpt)**: 5,325 samples
4. **wizardlm (alpaca)**: 5,145 samples
5. **alpaca**: 2,186 samples
6. **repair**: 1,034 samples
7. **openchat**: 1,033 samples
8. **flan**: 862 samples
9. **math**: 849 samples
10. **unnatural**: 582 samples
11. **dmcc**: 573 samples
12. **dolly**: 560 samples
13. **oasst**: 183 samples
14. **lima**: 70 samples
15. **mbpp**: 43 samples

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. However, since the paper primarily discusses the creation of **DIVINSTRUCT** from existing datasets, I will focus on the original papers or sources for the datasets listed above.

For example, I will look for citations related to:

- **Ultrachat**: I will need to find the original source or paper that introduced this dataset.
- **SharedGPT**: Similarly, I will find the citation for this dataset.
- **WizardLM**: I will check for the relevant citation for both versions (sharedgpt and alpaca).
- **Alpaca**: I will find the citation for the Alpaca dataset.
- **Repair, OpenChat, Flan, Math, Unnatural, DMCC, Dolly, OASST, Lima, MBPP**: I will search for the original papers or sources for these datasets as well.

Once I have gathered all the necessary citations, I will compile them into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its full citation.

Finally, I will summarize the findings and prepare the dataset entries for review or further processing.
