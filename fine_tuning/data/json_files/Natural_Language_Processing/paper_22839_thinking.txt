To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Controllable Continual Test-Time Adaptation" by Ziqi Shi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study and may mention specific datasets used for evaluation. In this case, the abstract does not explicitly name any datasets, so I will proceed to the introduction.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of Continual Test-Time Adaptation (CTTA) and mention that they evaluate their method on three large-scale benchmark datasets. This indicates that datasets are involved, but I need to find their specific names.

Next, I will look at **section 4.1 (Experimental Setting)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention:

1. **CIFAR10-C**: A dataset that contains 15 types of corruptions with 5 levels of severity, used for evaluating the robustness of models under various conditions.
2. **CIFAR100-C**: Similar to CIFAR10-C, but with 100 classes, also containing 15 types of corruptions with 5 levels of severity.
3. **ImageNet-C**: A dataset derived from ImageNet, which includes various corruptions to test model performance under challenging conditions.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **CIFAR10-C** and **CIFAR100-C**, the citation is:
  > Hendrycks, D., & Dietterich, T. (2019). *Benchmarking Neural Network Robustness to Common Corruptions and Surface Noises*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR).

- For **ImageNet-C**, the citation is:
  > Hendrycks, D., & Dietterich, T. (2019). *Benchmarking Neural Network Robustness to Common Corruptions and Surface Noises*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR).

Since CIFAR10-C and CIFAR100-C share the same citation, I will ensure to note that in my dataset extraction.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This structured approach ensures that I accurately capture all relevant information regarding the datasets used in the research paper.
