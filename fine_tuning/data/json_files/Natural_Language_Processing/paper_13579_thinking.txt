To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Risk-reducing design and operations toolkit: 90 strategies for managing risk and uncertainty in decision problems" by Alexander Gutfraind, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** to identify any mentions of datasets or data sources. The abstract indicates that data for the study is available at a specific GitHub repository, which is a strong indication that there is a dataset associated with this research.

Next, I will check the **results section** and any relevant sections that might discuss the methodology or data collection. In this case, the paper mentions that the strategies were sourced from various articles, monographs, and interviews, but it does not explicitly list multiple datasets. However, the GitHub link provided in the abstract is crucial as it likely contains the dataset used for the study.

I will then visit the provided GitHub link (https://github.com/sashagutfraind/uncertainty_strategies) to gather more information about the dataset. This will include checking for any README files or documentation that describe the dataset's contents, structure, and how it was compiled.

After gathering the necessary information from the GitHub repository, I will ensure to note the full citation for the dataset. Since the dataset is hosted on GitHub, I will cite it as follows:

- For the dataset available at the GitHub repository, the citation is:
  > Gutfraind, A. (2023). *Risk-reducing Design and Operations Toolkit: 90 Strategies for Managing Risk and Uncertainty in Decision Problems*. Retrieved from https://github.com/sashagutfraind/uncertainty_strategies

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including its description and citation, into a structured format for further use or analysis. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the dataset's details and provided proper attribution to the source.
