To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Review of Contemporary Energy Harvesting Techniques and their Feasibility in Wireless Geophones" by Naveed Iqbal et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections discussing energy harvesting techniques** to identify any datasets that may be referenced. The abstract provides a general overview of the research focus, but I will need to look deeper into the body of the paper for specific datasets.

Next, I will examine the **sections that detail the various energy harvesting methods** (solar, vibration, wind, thermal, and RF) to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned or referenced. I will pay particular attention to any case studies or experimental results that may involve datasets.

As I read through the paper, I will look for any **tables or figures** that summarize data related to energy harvesting techniques. For example, tables that list characteristics of different energy harvesting technologies or case studies that provide quantitative results will be crucial.

Once I identify any datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is important for proper attribution and to provide context for the data used in the research.

For instance, if the paper references specific datasets related to solar energy harvesting or vibration energy harvesting, I will ensure to note the authors, title, publication venue, and year of publication for each dataset.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes a clear description of the dataset, its relevance to the research, and the full citation.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format that can be easily reviewed or processed further, ensuring that all citations are accurate and complete.
