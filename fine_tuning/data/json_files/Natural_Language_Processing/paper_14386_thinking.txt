To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Contextualising Levels of Language Resourcedness affecting Digital Processing of Text" by C. Maria Keeta and Langa Khumalob, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and related work sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the characterization of languages as low-resource or high-resource, but it does not mention specific datasets. The introduction references digitization projects for the |xam and !kun languages, but again, no datasets are named.

Next, I will examine **section 3 (A more comprehensive view on low resourced languages)** and **section 3.2 (Categorising languages)**, as these sections may provide insights into datasets used for analysis or examples of language resources. However, the focus here is more on theoretical frameworks and categorizations rather than specific datasets.

In the **related work section**, the authors reference various studies and audits related to language resources, such as the Human Language Technology Audits (Moors et al., 2018; Sharma Grover et al., 2011). These audits may contain datasets or corpora relevant to the study of low-resource languages, but the paper does not provide specific dataset names or details.

I will also check the **References section** for any citations that might refer to datasets or corpora. For instance, the references to the Human Language Technology Audits and the Basic Language Resource Kit (BLARK) could lead to datasets, but they are not explicitly named as datasets in the paper.

After reviewing the entire paper, it appears that while the authors discuss various language resources and audits, they do not provide specific datasets with full citations. Therefore, I will note that the paper does not explicitly mention any datasets that can be extracted with full citations.

In conclusion, I will summarize my findings, indicating that the paper discusses the concept of language resources and their categorization but does not provide specific datasets or their citations. This will help in understanding the context of the research without having specific datasets to reference.
