To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Practical Deep Dispersed Watermarking with Synchronization and Fusion" by Qilong Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for experiments. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention conducting extensive experiments on three different datasets: **ImageNet**, **LabelMe**, and **OpenImages**. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for the research and will likely be detailed further in the methods or experiments sections.

Next, I will check the **experiments section** to confirm the datasets' usage and gather any additional details about them. The authors state that they randomly sample images from these datasets for their experiments, which reinforces their importance in the study.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is critical, as proper attribution is necessary for academic integrity.

1. **ImageNet**: The citation for ImageNet is:
   > Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, and Li Fei-Fei. *ImageNet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In CVPR. IEEE Computer Society, 248–255, 2009. https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2009.5206848

2. **LabelMe**: The citation for LabelMe is:
   > Bryan C. Russell, Antonio Torralba, Kevin P. Murphy, and William T. Freeman. *LabelMe: A Database and Web-Based Tool for Image Annotation*. Int. J. Comput. Vis. 77, 1-3, 157–173, 2008. https://doi.org/10.1007/s11263-007-0090-8

3. **OpenImages**: The citation for OpenImages is:
   > Alina Kuznetsova, Hassan Rom, Neil Alldrin, Jasper R. R. Uijlings, Ivan Krasin, Jordi Pont-Tuset, Shahab Kamali, Stefan Popov, Matteo Malloci, Tom Duerig, and Vittorio Ferrari. *The Open Images Dataset V4: Unified image classification, object detection, and visual relationship detection at scale*. CoRR abs/1811.00982, 2018.

With these citations in hand, I can now summarize the datasets used in the research paper, ensuring that I include the full citations as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the study, along with proper attribution to the original sources.
