To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Convergence and Complexity Guarantee for Inexact First-order Riemannian Optimization Algorithms" by Yuchen Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a summary of the research focus, but it may not detail specific datasets. The introduction often outlines the context and may reference datasets used in prior work, which could be relevant.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on experiments or datasets**. This section typically contains detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the experiments, including their names, sizes, and any relevant characteristics. If the paper has a section titled "Experiments" or "Datasets," I will focus on that to gather specific information.

In the **experiments section**, I will look for any mentions of datasets used for validation or testing of the proposed algorithms. I will note down the names of these datasets, their descriptions, and any relevant statistics provided by the authors.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily. I will look for papers or resources that describe the datasets in detail.

For each dataset identified, I will compile the following information:
1. **Dataset Name**: The official name of the dataset.
2. **Description**: A brief description of the dataset, including its purpose and any relevant characteristics (e.g., size, type of data).
3. **Full Citation**: The complete reference for the dataset, formatted according to academic standards.

Once I have gathered all this information, I will ensure that it is clearly organized and ready for presentation or further processing. This structured approach will help ensure that I capture all relevant details about the datasets mentioned in the paper.
