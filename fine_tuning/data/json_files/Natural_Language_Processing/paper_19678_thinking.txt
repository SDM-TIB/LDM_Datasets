To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Prompt-Driven Dynamic Object-Centric Learning for Single Domain Generalization" by Deng Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used in their experiments. In this section, I will look for detailed descriptions of each dataset, including their names, characteristics, and any relevant statistics.

From the text, I find two datasets mentioned:

1. **PACS Dataset**: This dataset is described as a generalization benchmark in the image classification domain, containing 9,991 images across four fields (art paintings, cartoons, photos, and sketches) with significant stylistic differences.

2. **Diverse-Weather Dataset**: This dataset is used for urban-scene detection domain generalization and consists of images from five different weather conditions, with specific numbers of training and validation images provided for each condition.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations I find are:

- For the **PACS Dataset**:
  > Da Li, Yongxin Yang, Yi-Zhe Song, and Timothy M Hospedales. *Deeper, broader and artier domain generalization*. In Proceedings of the IEEE international conference on computer vision, pages 5542–5550, 2017.

- For the **Diverse-Weather Dataset**:
  > Aming Wu and Cheng Deng. *Single-domain generalized object detection in urban scene via cyclic-disentangled self-distillation*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pages 847–856, 2022.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This structured approach will help in accurately documenting the datasets used in the research paper.
