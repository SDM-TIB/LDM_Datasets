To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deconstructing Word Embedding Algorithms" by Kian Kenyon-Dean et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections discussing the methodologies and experiments** to find any references to datasets. The abstract provides a general overview, but I will focus on the introduction and subsequent sections for specific mentions of datasets.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss various word embedding algorithms like Word2vec and GloVe, but they do not explicitly mention any datasets. I will continue to the next sections.

Next, I will examine **section 3 (Word embedding algorithms)** and its subsections, where the authors describe different algorithms. They reference several foundational papers and methodologies but do not specify any datasets used for training or evaluation.

I will also check the **related work and discussion sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned in the context of previous studies or comparisons. However, it appears that the focus is primarily on theoretical insights rather than empirical evaluations involving specific datasets.

Finally, I will look at the **references section** to see if any of the cited works include datasets. The references list includes foundational papers on Word2vec, GloVe, and other algorithms, but again, there are no explicit mentions of datasets used in the current paper.

After thoroughly reviewing the paper, it seems that there are no specific datasets mentioned for extraction. The authors focus on theoretical frameworks and comparisons of algorithms rather than empirical results based on specific datasets.

Since no datasets were identified in this paper, I will conclude that there are no dataset entries to create. If there were datasets mentioned, I would have retrieved their full citations from the references section to ensure proper documentation.

In summary, I will document that no datasets were found in this research paper, and therefore, no dataset entries will be created.
