To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Temporal Importance Factor for Loss Functions for CTR Prediction" by Ramazan Tarık Türksoy et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that experiments were conducted on both public and company datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, particularly **subsection 4.2 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used in their experiments. Here, I find two datasets mentioned:

1. **Avazu Dataset**: This dataset consists of 10 days of ad click-through data and includes 23 fields with various user, item, and contextual features. The authors note that it is ordered chronologically and that they split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets in a ratio of 8:1:1.

2. **Company Dataset**: This dataset is described as an industrial advertising platform CVR dataset, consisting of 8 days of training data and 1 day of test data. It includes 33 fields, covering user features, item features, and contextual features.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper. However, the datasets themselves may not have dedicated citations since they are commonly used datasets in the field. Therefore, I will provide the citations based on the information available:

- For the **Avazu Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Avazu. *Avazu CTR Prediction Dataset*. Available at: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/avazu-ctr-prediction/data.

- For the **Company Dataset**, since it is proprietary and does not have a formal citation, I will note it as:
  > Company Dataset. *Industrial advertising platform CVR dataset*. Internal dataset used for experiments.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations as required. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets utilized in the research.
