To extract datasets from the research paper titled "UNIFYING SEQUENCES, STRUCTURES, AND DESCRIPTIONS FOR ANY-TO-ANY PROTEIN GENERATION WITH THE LARGE MULTIMODAL MODEL HELIXPROTX" by Zhiyuan Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention key datasets used in the study. 

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the significance of protein research and the need for multimodal datasets, which may hint at the datasets they utilized. 

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly the subsection titled "Dataset." Here, the authors describe how they curated a multimodal protein dataset by integrating resources from UniProtQA and SwissProt. They mention that they extracted amino acid sequences and corresponding functional descriptions from UniProtQA and paired them with three-dimensional structures from SwissProt.

The paper states that they created a multimodal dataset comprising **361,498 proteins**, which can generate six samples corresponding to various tasks: sequence-to-description, structure-to-description, description-to-sequence, structure-to-sequence, description-to-structure, and sequence-to-structure. This detailed description confirms the existence of a significant dataset.

Now, I will look for the **full citations** for the datasets mentioned. The authors reference UniProtQA and SwissProt, so I will retrieve the citations for these resources:

1. **UniProtQA**: 
   > UniProt Consortium. *UniProt: a hub for protein information*. Nucleic acids research, 43(D1):D204–D212, 2015.

2. **SwissProt**: 
   > Boeckmann, B., Bairoch, A., Apweiler, R., Blatter, M.-C., Estreicher, M., Gasteiger, E., et al. *The Swiss-Prot protein knowledgebase and its supplement TrEMBL in 2003*. Nucleic acids research, 31(1):365–370, 2003.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as specified. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
