To extract datasets from the research paper titled "High-content stimulated Raman histology of human breast cancer" by Hongli Ni et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, results, and discussion sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study and may mention specific datasets or types of data collected. The introduction often contextualizes the research and may reference previous datasets used in similar studies.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, which typically details the experimental setup and data acquisition processes. Here, I will look for any specific datasets mentioned, such as those related to breast cancer tissue samples or imaging data. The authors mention that breast cancer tissue samples were purchased from Biochain Institute, which indicates a specific dataset related to the tissue samples used in their experiments.

In the **results section**, I will look for any additional datasets that may have been generated or analyzed during the study. The authors discuss the chemical mapping of various components in breast tissue, which may imply the existence of datasets related to these mappings.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. For example, if the authors refer to specific datasets or studies that provided data, I will ensure to include those citations.

Based on my reading, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **Breast Cancer Tissue Samples**: The authors used freshly frozen tissue sections purchased from Biochain Institute. This dataset is crucial for their analysis and findings.

2. **SRS Imaging Data**: The study generated hyperspectral SRS imaging data from the breast cancer tissue samples, which is essential for their high-content stimulated Raman histology analysis.

Now, I will compile the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Breast Cancer Tissue Samples**:
  > Biochain Institute. *Breast Cancer Tissue Samples*. Biochain Institute, Newark, CA.

- For the **SRS Imaging Data**, since it is generated by the authors, I will note that it is part of their original research and does not have a separate citation.

Finally, I will ensure that I have accurately captured the essence of each dataset and its relevance to the study, preparing to present this information in the required format for further processing or review.
