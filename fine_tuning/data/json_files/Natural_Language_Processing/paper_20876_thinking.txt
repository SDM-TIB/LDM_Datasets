To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fact Checking Beyond Training Set" by Payam Karisani and Heng Ji, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors propose a method to repurpose existing datasets for fact-checking, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental setup section**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention using two datasets: **MultiFC** and **Snopes**. I will look for detailed descriptions of these datasets, including their characteristics and how they were utilized in the experiments.

Upon reviewing the relevant sections, I find the following details:

1. **MultiFC Dataset**: The authors describe it as a multi-domain dataset for evidence-based fact-checking. It includes claims categorized into various domains such as Arts, Business, Politics, and more. The dataset is referenced as being created by Augenstein et al. (2019).

2. **Snopes Dataset**: This dataset is mentioned as a richly annotated corpus for fact-checking tasks, created by Hanselowski et al. (2019). The authors note that it contains claims and evidence documents.

Next, I will check the **References section** of the paper to retrieve the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **MultiFC Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Isabelle Augenstein, Christina Lioma, Dongsheng Wang, Lucas Chaves Lima, Casper Hansen, Christian Hansen, and Jakob Grue Simonsen. *MultiFC: A Real-World Multi-Domain Dataset for Evidence-Based Fact Checking of Claims*. In Proceedings of the 2019 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing and the 9th International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing, EMNLP-IJCNLP 2019, Hong Kong, China, November 3-7, 2019, pages 4684–4696. Association for Computational Linguistics.

- For the **Snopes Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Andreas Hanselowski, Christian Stab, Claudia Schulz, Zile Li, and Iryna Gurevych. *A Richly Annotated Corpus for Different Tasks in Automated Fact-Checking*. In Proceedings of the 23rd Conference on Computational Natural Language Learning, CoNLL 2019, Hong Kong, China, November 3-4, 2019, pages 493–503. Association for Computational Linguistics.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or analysis.
