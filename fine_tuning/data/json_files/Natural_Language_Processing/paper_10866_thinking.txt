To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Condition-Invariant Semantic Segmentation" by Christos Sakaridis et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract highlights the use of the **Cityscapes** dataset as the labeled source-domain set and mentions two target-domain datasets: **Dark Zurich** and **ACDC**. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for the experiments conducted in the paper.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (Section 4) where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used. In **Section 4.1.2**, they explicitly list the datasets:

1. **Cityscapes**: This dataset is described as a large dataset of urban driving scenes, containing high-quality pixel-level semantic annotations for 19 common classes. It consists of a training set with 2975 images, a validation set with 500 images, and a test set with 1525 images.

2. **Dark Zurich**: This dataset comprises 2617 nighttime images of driving scenes, split into 2416 training, 50 validation, and 151 test images. It also features high-quality semantic annotations for the same classes as Cityscapes.

3. **ACDC**: The ACDC dataset consists of 4006 images of driving scenes distributed evenly among four adverse conditions: night, fog, rain, and snow. The training, validation, and test sets contain 1600, 406, and 2000 images, respectively, with high-quality semantic annotations.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **Cityscapes**, the citation is:
  > M. Cordts, M. Omran, S. Ramos, T. Rehfeld, M. Enzweiler, R. Benenson, U. Franke, S. Roth, and B. Schiele. *The Cityscapes dataset for semantic urban scene understanding*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2016.

- For **Dark Zurich**, the citation is:
  > C. Sakaridis, D. Dai, and L. Van Gool. *ACDC: The Adverse Conditions Dataset with Correspondences for semantic driving scene understanding*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2021.

- For **ACDC**, the citation is the same as above since it is part of the same work.

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
