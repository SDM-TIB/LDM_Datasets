To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Shadow Generation with Decomposed Mask Prediction and Attentive Shadow Filling" by Xinhao Tao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions the creation of a large-scale dataset called **RdSOBA** to supplement an existing dataset, which indicates that there are at least two datasets involved. The introduction further elaborates on the shadow generation task and references another dataset called **DESOBA**, which was previously introduced by Hong, Niu, and Zhang in 2022.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any relevant subsections that describe the datasets in detail. In this paper, the details about the datasets are primarily found in **Section 3 (Our RdSOBA Dataset)**. Here, the authors describe how they constructed the **RdSOBA** dataset, including the number of images and tuples it contains. They also provide a comparison with the **DESOBA** dataset, which is crucial for understanding the context and significance of both datasets.

In **Section 3.1**, the authors explain that **RdSOBA** consists of 114,350 ground-truth images and 280,000 tuples, created using rendering techniques. This section provides essential details about the dataset's construction, which I will summarize.

In **Section 5.1 (Datasets and Implementation Details)**, the authors mention the **DESOBA** dataset again, specifying that it contains 2,792 training tuples and 580 testing tuples. This confirms its relevance to the experiments conducted in the paper.

Now, I will gather the full citations for both datasets from the **References section** of the paper:

1. For **DESOBA**, the citation is:
   > Hong, Y., Niu, L., & Zhang, J. (2022). Shadow generation for composite image in real-world scenes. In Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, volume 36, 914â€“922.

2. For **RdSOBA**, since it is a newly created dataset by the authors, I will cite it as follows:
   > Tao, X., Cao, J., Hong, Y., & Niu, L. (2024). Shadow Generation with Decomposed Mask Prediction and Attentive Shadow Filling. In Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence.

After collecting all the necessary information, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

- **RdSOBA**: A large-scale rendered dataset with 114,350 ground-truth images and 280,000 tuples for shadow generation tasks.
- **DESOBA**: A synthetic dataset with 2,792 training tuples and 580 testing tuples, previously introduced for shadow generation tasks.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly presents each dataset along with its citation, ensuring that all details are accurately captured for future reference or analysis.
