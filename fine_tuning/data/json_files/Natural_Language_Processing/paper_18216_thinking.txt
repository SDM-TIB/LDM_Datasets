To extract datasets from the research paper titled "FAIR ENOUGH: DEVELOP AND ASSESS A FAIR-COMPLIANT DATASET FOR LARGE LANGUAGE MODEL TRAINING?" by Shaina Raza et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the paper discusses the development of a FAIR-compliant dataset aimed at detecting and mitigating biases in large language models (LLMs). This suggests that a specific dataset is central to the research.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly the case study described. The authors mention that they developed a dataset sourced from various channels, including news feeds and websites, between January and May 2023. They state that this dataset contains over 50,000 filtered entries, which is a significant detail indicating the dataset's scale and purpose.

In the **data collection and curation section**, the authors provide more details about the dataset, including its structure and the metadata used to enhance its findability. They emphasize that the dataset is designed to include diverse narratives related to social issues, which aligns with the goal of addressing biases in LLMs.

I will also check the **appendices and references section** for any additional datasets mentioned or cited. The authors refer to their dataset as a "FAIR-compliant dataset" and provide a link to where it can be accessed, which is crucial for citation purposes.

Now, I will compile the necessary information about the dataset:

1. **FAIR-Compliant Dataset**: This dataset is the primary focus of the paper, developed to identify and mitigate biases in LLMs. It includes over 50,000 entries filtered from various news sources.

Next, I will look for the full citation of the dataset. The authors mention that the dataset is available on Hugging Face, Zenodo, and Figshare, and it is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International (CC BY-NC 4.0) license. However, they do not provide a specific citation for the dataset itself in the references.

To ensure I have a complete citation, I will format it based on the information provided in the paper:

- **Dataset Citation**:
  > Raza, S., Ghuge, S., Ding, C., Dolatabadi, E., & Pandya, D. (2024). *FAIR-Compliant Dataset for Large Language Model Training*. Available at: https://huggingface.co/collections/newsmediabias/biasscan-659d681ed7a5bc9d98cde11b

After gathering all this information, I will prepare to create the dataset entry in the required format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the dataset as it is critical for proper attribution and future reference.
