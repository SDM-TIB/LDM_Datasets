To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SEA++: Multi-Graph-based High-Order Sensor Alignment for Multivariate Time-Series Unsupervised Domain Adaptation" by Yucheng Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluated their methods on public MTS datasets, which indicates that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used. In this section, they mention two datasets:

1. **C-MAPSS**: This dataset describes the degradation process of aircraft engines, with MTS data collected from 14 sensors measuring various physical parameters. The dataset includes four sub-datasets collected under different working conditions and fault modes.

2. **Opportunity HAR**: This dataset is used for human activity recognition and consists of MTS data from 113 sensors deployed on various locations of the human body. After preprocessing, 110 sensors were used for evaluation.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **C-MAPSS**, the citation is:
  > Saxena, A., Goebel, K., Simon, D., & Eklund, N. (2008). Damage propagation modeling for aircraft engine run-to-failure simulation. In *2008 International Conference on Prognostics and Health Management* (pp. 1-9).

- For **Opportunity HAR**, the citation is:
  > Roggen, D., Calatroni, A., Rossi, M., Holleczek, T., Förster, K., Tröster, G., ... & Millán, J. d. R. (2010). Collecting complex activity datasets in highly rich networked sensor environments. In *2010 Seventh International Conference on Networked Sensing Systems (INSS)* (pp. 233-240).

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
