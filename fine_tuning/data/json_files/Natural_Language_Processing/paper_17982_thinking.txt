To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CLSA-CIM: A Cross-Layer Scheduling Approach for Computing-in-Memory Architectures" by Rebecca Pelke et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and evaluation sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. The introduction discusses the context and motivation for the research, focusing on computing-in-memory architectures and scheduling algorithms, but again does not reference specific datasets.

Next, I will examine the **evaluation section** more closely, as this is where datasets are often discussed in the context of experiments and results. In this paper, the authors mention a case study using the **TinyYOLOv4** model, which is a neural network architecture. However, they do not provide a specific dataset name associated with this model. Instead, they refer to benchmarks like **VGG16**, **VGG19**, **ResNet50**, **ResNet101**, and **ResNet152**, which are well-known models but do not specify the datasets used for training or evaluation.

I will also check the **references section** to see if any datasets are cited indirectly through the references to other works. However, the references primarily focus on architectural and algorithmic advancements rather than specific datasets.

Since the paper does not explicitly mention any datasets used for training or evaluation, I will note that while the authors discuss various models and their performance, they do not provide full citations for any datasets. Therefore, I will conclude that there are no datasets to extract from this paper.

In summary, I will document that the paper does not provide specific datasets, and thus there are no full citations to include. This is an important finding as it highlights a potential gap in the paper regarding the reproducibility of the results presented.
