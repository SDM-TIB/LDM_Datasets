To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Immunization Against Harmful Fine-Tuning Attacks" by Domenic Rosati et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections that discuss experiments and methodologies**. The abstract provides a high-level overview, but I will focus on the sections that likely contain detailed information about datasets.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention the need for defenses against harmful fine-tuning, which suggests that they may reference specific datasets used for training or evaluation. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or examples of harmful training data.

Next, I will examine **section 2 (Threat Model for Harmful Fine-Tuning Attacks)**, where the authors describe the harmful dataset \(D_{\text{harmful}}\) used in their experiments. They define it as a collection of prompts and target responses designed to elicit harmful behavior from language models. This section is crucial as it outlines the nature of the dataset.

In **Appendix C**, the authors provide a detailed description of their experimental setup, including the specific dataset they used for their harmful training attack. They mention using the **BeaverTails dataset**, which consists of question-answer pairs that are considered unsafe. This dataset is pivotal for their experiments, and I will note its details.

Now, I will gather the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. **BeaverTails Dataset**: The authors reference this dataset in their experimental section. However, they do not provide a formal citation within the text. I will need to search for any existing literature or repositories that describe this dataset to provide a proper citation.

Next, I will check the **References section** for any additional datasets that may have been cited indirectly or used in the context of their experiments. I will look for any datasets mentioned in the context of harmful training or evaluation metrics.

After compiling the information, I will ensure that I have the full citation for the **BeaverTails dataset** and any other datasets that may have been referenced in the paper. If the dataset is not formally cited, I will note that it may require further investigation to find the appropriate source.

Finally, I will summarize the findings, ensuring that each dataset is clearly documented with its name, description, and full citation, ready for structured output or further analysis.
