To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Understanding Practical Membership Privacy of Deep Learning" by Marlon Tobaben et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions applying a membership inference attack (MIA) to evaluate privacy vulnerabilities in image classification models, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **Methods section**, particularly the **B.3 Datasets** subsection, where the authors provide a table listing the datasets used in their experiments. This section is likely to contain detailed information about each dataset, including their names, properties, and any relevant metrics.

In the **B.3 Datasets** subsection, I find the following datasets listed:

1. **Patch Camelyon**: This dataset is used for binary classification (C=2) and has a maximum of 256 shots per class. The test accuracy ranges from 82.8% to 85.6%.

2. **CIFAR10**: A well-known dataset for image classification with 10 classes (C=10). The maximum number of shots is 2048, and the test accuracy ranges from 92.7% to 97.7%.

3. **EuroSAT**: This dataset is used for land cover classification with 10 classes (C=10). The maximum number of shots is 512, with test accuracy ranging from 80.2% to 96.7%.

4. **Pets**: This dataset consists of images of various pets, with 37 classes (C=37) and a maximum of 32 shots per class. The test accuracy ranges from 82.3% to 90.7%.

5. **Resics45**: A dataset with 45 classes (C=45) and a maximum of 256 shots per class. The test accuracy ranges from 83.5% to 91.6%.

6. **CIFAR100**: Similar to CIFAR10 but with 100 classes (C=100). The maximum number of shots is 128, and the test accuracy ranges from 82.2% to 87.6%.

Now, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

With this information, I can now compile the dataset entries for further processing or review. Each dataset will be documented with its name, properties, and full citation to ensure proper attribution.
