To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Recall Them All: Retrieval-Augmented Language Models for Long Object List Extraction from Long Documents" by Sneha Singhania et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the construction of a new dataset consisting of 10 books or book series, which indicates that there is a dataset relevant to the research. The introduction further elaborates on the dataset, stating that it includes ground-truth lists of object values associated with subject-predicate pairs.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **Datasets** section or any relevant subsections that provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the experiments. In this paper, the dataset is discussed in **section 5 (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors describe the dataset they constructed for their experiments. They mention that the dataset comprises 580 distinct subject-predicate pairs for 8 predicates, covering approximately 4000 entities with around 7300 alias names.

I will summarize the key details of the dataset as follows:

1. **Dataset Name**: The paper does not provide a specific name for the dataset, but it is referred to as the dataset constructed for the experiments involving long object list extraction from books.

2. **Description**: The dataset consists of 10 popular novels and book series, with a total of approximately 16,000 pages. It includes ground-truth lists of object values associated with subject-predicate pairs, derived from fan communities and other sources.

3. **Statistics**: The dataset includes 580 distinct subject-predicate pairs for 8 predicates, with a total of about 4000 entities appearing under approximately 7300 alias names.

Next, I will consult the **References section** to find any citations related to the dataset. However, since the dataset is newly constructed and does not have a formal citation in the references, I will note that the authors plan to release the dataset upon publication.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the relevant details and any citations if applicable. Since there are no formal citations for the dataset, I will indicate that the dataset is forthcoming.

In summary, the dataset extraction process involves identifying the dataset's existence, summarizing its details, and noting the lack of formal citation while indicating its future availability.
