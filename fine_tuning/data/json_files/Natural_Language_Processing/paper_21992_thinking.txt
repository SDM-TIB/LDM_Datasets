To extract datasets from the research paper titled "HaLo-NeRF: Learning Geometry-Guided Semantics for Exploring Unconstrained Photo Collections" by Chen Dudai et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to gather initial insights about any datasets referenced. The abstract mentions a "new benchmark dataset containing large-scale scenes with ground-truth segmentations for multiple semantic concepts," indicating that a dataset is indeed present.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (The HolyScenes Benchmark)**, where the authors explicitly describe the dataset they created. Here, they detail that the HolyScenes dataset consists of images associated with six landmarks, including:

1. **Notre-Dame Cathedral (Paris)**
2. **Milan Cathedral (Milan)**
3. **St. Paulâ€™s Cathedral (London)**
4. **Badshahi Mosque (Lahore)**
5. **Blue Mosque (Istanbul)**
6. **Hurva Synagogue (Jerusalem)**

The authors specify that this dataset includes 6,305 images with ground-truth segmentations for multiple semantic categories, such as portals, windows, spires, towers, domes, and minarets.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper. The authors reference the following sources related to the datasets:

- For the **HolyScenes dataset**, the citation is:
  > Dudai, C., Alper, M., Bezalel, H., Hanocka, R., Lang, I., & Averbuch-Elor, H. (2024). *HaLo-NeRF: Learning Geometry-Guided Semantics for Exploring Unconstrained Photo Collections*. In Computer Graphics Forum, 43(2).

Additionally, the authors mention using images from the **WikiScenes dataset** and other sources, which I will also document:

- For the **WikiScenes dataset**, the citation is:
  > Wu, X., Averbuch-Elor, H., Sun, J., & Snavely, N. (2021). *Towers of Babel: Combining Images, Language, and 3D Geometry for Learning Multimodal Vision*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV).

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
