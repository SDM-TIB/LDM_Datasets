To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Panmodal Information Interaction" by Chirag Shah and Ryen W. White, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** to see if the authors mention any datasets or data sources that were utilized in their research. The abstract discusses the transformation of information interaction through generative AI but does not explicitly mention any datasets.

Next, I will examine the **methodology and results sections** to identify any datasets used in their survey or experiments. In the **section on the survey**, the authors mention that they surveyed a few hundred crowdworkers, resulting in 130 usable responses after data cleaning. However, they do not specify a formal dataset name for this survey data.

I will also look for any **tables or figures** that might summarize data or results. For instance, they present survey results in **Figure 2** and **Table 1**, but these do not refer to external datasets; rather, they summarize findings from their own survey.

Since the paper does not reference any publicly available datasets or external data sources, I will check the **References section** to see if any cited works include datasets. The references primarily consist of academic papers and articles related to information retrieval and human-computer interaction, but they do not indicate any specific datasets.

After reviewing the entire paper, it appears that the authors conducted their own survey and did not utilize any pre-existing datasets. Therefore, I will note that while the paper discusses survey data, it does not provide formal dataset citations as there are no external datasets referenced.

In conclusion, I will summarize my findings as follows:

1. **Survey Data**: The authors conducted a survey with 130 responses, but this data is not formally cited as a dataset.
2. **No External Datasets**: The paper does not reference any external datasets or provide citations for datasets used in their research.

Since there are no datasets to cite, I will conclude my extraction process here.
