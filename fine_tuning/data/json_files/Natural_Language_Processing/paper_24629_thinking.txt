To extract datasets from the research paper titled "LightStereo: Channel Boost Is All Your Need for Efficient 2D Cost Aggregation" by Xianda Guo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that LightStereo achieves competitive performance on the **SceneFlow datasets** and **KITTI** benchmarks, indicating that these are the datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically **section 4.1 (Datasets and Evaluation Metrics)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used:

1. **SceneFlow Dataset**: This dataset is described as a synthetic stereo collection that includes 35,454 training image pairs and 4,370 testing image pairs, with a resolution of 960Ã—540. It provides dense disparity maps as ground truth and is categorized into cleanpass and finalpass images.

2. **KITTI Dataset**: The paper references two subsets of the KITTI dataset:
   - **KITTI 2012**: Contains 194 training and 195 testing image pairs, providing sparse ground-truth disparities.
   - **KITTI 2015**: Offers 200 image pairs for both training and testing, also with sparse ground-truth disparities.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **SceneFlow Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Nikolaus Mayer, Eddy Ilg, Philip Hausser, Philipp Fischer, Daniel Cremers, Alexey Dosovitskiy, and Thomas Brox. *A large dataset to train convolutional networks for disparity, optical flow, and scene flow estimation*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2016.

- For the **KITTI Dataset**, the citation for KITTI 2012 is:
  > Andreas Geiger, Philip Lenz, and Raquel Urtasun. *Are we ready for autonomous driving? The KITTI vision benchmark suite*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2012.

And for KITTI 2015:
  > Moritz Menze and Andreas Geiger. *Object scene flow for autonomous vehicles*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2015.

Having gathered the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research.
