To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Co-optimization of power line shutoff and restoration under high wildfire ignition risk" by Noah Rhodes and Line A. Roald, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study and may mention specific datasets used for analysis or validation.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to see if the authors reference any datasets that are critical to their research. This section often outlines the background and significance of the study, which may include key datasets.

In the **methodology section**, I will look for detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the experiments. This section typically includes information about the data sources, the nature of the data, and how it was utilized in the study. For instance, the authors mention using the **IEEE RTS-GMLC test case** and **wildfire risk data from the US Geological Survey**. I will note these datasets and their relevance to the research.

I will also check the **results section** to confirm the datasets' application in the experiments and any specific findings related to them. This will help ensure that I accurately capture how the datasets were used in the context of the study.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access the datasets themselves.

For the datasets identified, I will compile the following information:
1. **Dataset Name**: The official name of the dataset.
2. **Description**: A brief description of what the dataset contains and its purpose.
3. **Full Citation**: The complete reference for the dataset as it appears in the references section of the paper.

For example, I will note the following datasets:
- **IEEE RTS-GMLC test case**: This dataset is a synthetic test system used for evaluating power system operations under wildfire risk scenarios.
- **Wildfire risk data from the US Geological Survey**: This dataset provides daily forecasts of wildfire risk, which are critical for the optimization model presented in the paper.

Finally, I will ensure that I have the correct citations for these datasets, formatted according to academic standards, to include in the final output.

By following these steps, I will be able to extract and document the datasets used in the research paper effectively.
