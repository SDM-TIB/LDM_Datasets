To extract datasets from the research paper titled "BM2CP: Efficient Collaborative Perception with LiDAR-Camera Modalities" by Binyu Zhao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the paper's focus and any datasets that might be referenced. The abstract mentions that extensive experiments were conducted on both simulated and real-world datasets, which indicates that datasets are likely discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors specifically mention two datasets used for their experiments: **OPV2V dataset** and **DAIR-V2X dataset**. I will take note of the context in which these datasets are mentioned, including their purpose and any specific characteristics highlighted by the authors.

In the **experimental setup section**, the authors provide descriptions of the datasets:
1. **OPV2V dataset**: Described as a vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) collaborative perception dataset, co-simulated by OpenCDA and Carla, with a perception range of 40m × 40m.
2. **DAIR-V2X dataset**: Identified as the first public real-world collaborative perception dataset, containing samples from vehicles and infrastructure equipped with LiDAR and cameras, with a perception range of 201.6m × 80m.

Next, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. The relevant citations are:

- For **OPV2V dataset**:
  > Xu, R., Xiang, H., Xia, X., Han, J., Li, J., & Ma, J. (2022). OPV2V: An open benchmark dataset and fusion pipeline for perception with vehicle-to-vehicle communication. In 2022 International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA), pages 2583–2589. IEEE.

- For **DAIR-V2X dataset**:
  > Yu, H., Luo, Y., Shu, M., Huo, Y., Yang, Z., Shi, Y., Guo, H., Li, H., Hu, X., Yuan, J., et al. (2022). DAIR-V2X: A large-scale dataset for vehicle-infrastructure cooperative 3D object detection. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 21361–21370.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or processing. This includes ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation for proper referencing.
