To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Gabor-Guided Transformer for Single Image Deraining" by Sijin He and Guangfeng Lin, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, while the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of image deraining and mention various techniques, but I need to look for specific datasets. The **experimental results section** is crucial, as it typically lists the datasets used for evaluation.

Upon reviewing the **experimental results section**, I find that the authors mention five public benchmark datasets used in their experiments:

1. **Rain200L**: This dataset is referenced multiple times in the paper, indicating its significance in evaluating the proposed method.

2. **Rain200H**: Similar to Rain200L, this dataset is also mentioned as part of the evaluation process.

3. **DID-Data**: This dataset is included in the list of datasets used for testing the model's performance.

4. **DDN-Data**: Another dataset referenced for performance evaluation.

5. **AGAN-Data**: This dataset is specifically mentioned for evaluating the model's performance on raindrop removal.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations will provide the necessary details about each dataset, including authors, titles, and publication information.

After reviewing the references, I find the following citations:

- For **Rain200L** and **Rain200H**, the citation is:
  > Wenhan Yang, Robby T Tan, Jiashi Feng, Jiaying Liu, Zongming Guo, and Shuicheng Yan. "Deep joint rain detection and removal from a single image." In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2017, pp. 1357–1366.

- For **DID-Data**, the citation is:
  > He Zhang and Vishal M Patel. "Density-aware single image deraining using a multi-stream dense network." In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2018, pp. 695–704.

- For **DDN-Data**, the citation is:
  > Xueyang Fu, Jiabin Huang, Delu Zeng, Yue Huang, Xinghao Ding, and John Paisley. "Removing rain from single images via a deep detail network." In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2017, pp. 3855–3863.

- For **AGAN-Data**, the citation is:
  > Rui Qian, Robby T Tan, Wenhan Yang, Jiajun Su, and Jiaying Liu. "Attentive generative adversarial network for raindrop removal from a single image." In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2018, pp. 2482–2491.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their full citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
