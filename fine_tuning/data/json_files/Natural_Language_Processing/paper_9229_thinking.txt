To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Data-based optimal estimation of frequency bias: The case of Southwest Power Pool" by Miroslav KosaniÄ‡ et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on estimating frequency bias using online system measurements, which suggests that data from a specific system is utilized.

Next, I will examine **section II (Automatic Generation Control)** and **section IV (Numerical Results using SPP System)**, as these sections are likely to contain detailed information about the datasets used in the analysis. In section IV, the authors mention that they were provided with data from the Southwest Power Pool (SPP), which is crucial for understanding the context of the datasets.

In **section IV.A (Data provided by the system operator)**, the authors summarize the data they received, which includes:

1. **ACEf [min]**: Interchange part of ACE in MW.
2. **fref [min]**: Scheduled frequency in Hz.
3. **f [min]**: Measured frequency in Hz.
4. **PG[min]**: Actual generation of the system.
5. **N AI[min]**: Net actual interchange.

This summary indicates that the data is sampled on a minute basis and is essential for the analysis of frequency bias.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. However, since the datasets are derived from operational data provided by the SPP, I will focus on the relevant references that discuss the SPP data and its usage in frequency regulation.

The citation for the SPP data is not explicitly provided in the references, but the authors refer to the SPP in their discussions. Therefore, I will note that the data is sourced from the Southwest Power Pool, which is a recognized entity in the field of power systems.

To summarize, the key dataset extracted from the paper is:

- **SPP Data**: This dataset includes various measurements related to frequency regulation, such as ACE, scheduled and measured frequencies, actual generation, and net interchange.

Since the SPP data is operational data and does not have a formal citation like a published dataset, I will document it as follows:

- **Southwest Power Pool Data**: Data provided by the Southwest Power Pool for the analysis of frequency bias estimation.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that I have accurately captured the necessary details and citations.
