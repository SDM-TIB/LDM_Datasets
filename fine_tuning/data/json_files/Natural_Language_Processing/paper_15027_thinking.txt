To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Non-ergodicity in reinforcement learning: robustness via ergodicity transformations" by Dominik Baumann et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the challenges in reinforcement learning (RL) and mentions the use of standard RL benchmarks, which suggests that datasets may be involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. I will look for any specific names or descriptions of datasets that were utilized in their experiments. 

In the **results section**, I will check if the authors provide any performance metrics or comparisons that reference specific datasets. This can help confirm the datasets used and their relevance to the study.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets.

For example, if the paper mentions using the **Cart-Pole** and **Reacher** environments as benchmarks, I will look for their citations. The citations might be:

- For **Cart-Pole**:
  > B. Barto, R. S. Sutton, and C. J. C. H. D. A. G. Barto. *Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction*. MIT Press, 2018.

- For **Reacher**:
  > Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L., Schneider, J., Schulman, J., Tang, J., & Zaremba, W. (2016). *OpenAI Gym*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01540.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
