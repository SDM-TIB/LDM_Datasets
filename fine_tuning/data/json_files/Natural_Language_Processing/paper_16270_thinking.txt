To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Naturalness of Attention: Revisiting Attention in Code Language Models" by Mootez Saad and Tushar Sharma, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's goals but does not explicitly mention datasets. However, the introduction discusses the use of **CodeSearchNet dataset** for creating corpora for two programming languages, Java and Python, which indicates that this is a dataset of interest.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly **section 3.1 (Methodology)**, where the authors specify that they used the **CodeSearchNet dataset** to create the corpora for their experiments. They mention that each corpus consists of 5,000 randomly sampled code snippets for Java and Python, which provides context about the dataset's structure and purpose.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the **CodeSearchNet dataset**. The relevant citation is:

- For **CodeSearchNet dataset**:
  > Hamel Husain, Ho-Hsiang Wu, Tiferet Gazit, Miltiadis Allamanis, and Marc Brockschmidt. *CodeSearchNet Challenge: Evaluating the State of Semantic Code Search*. CoRR abs/1909.09436 (2019). arXiv:1909.09436 http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.09436

Since this is the only dataset explicitly mentioned in the paper, I will summarize the findings related to it.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring that I include the full citation as required. This structured approach allows me to accurately extract and document the dataset used in the research paper.
