To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Cognitive Overload: Jailbreaking Large Language Models with Overloaded Logical Thinking" by Nan Xu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions experiments conducted on **AdvBench** and **MasterKey**, indicating that these are likely the datasets used in the study.

Next, I will focus on the **Evaluation Setup section**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they provide details about both datasets:

1. **AdvBench**: This dataset consists of 520 harmful behaviors formulated as instructions that reflect a wide spectrum of detrimental content, including profanity, graphic depictions, and misinformation.

2. **MasterKey**: This dataset comprises 11 prohibitive scenarios delineated by four key LLM chatbot service providers, with a total of 55 instances collected to ensure diverse representation of perspectives and nuances within each prohibited scenario.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **AdvBench**, the citation is:
  > Zou, A., Wang, J., Kolter, J. Z., & Fredrikson, M. (2023). Universal and transferable adversarial attacks on aligned language models. arXiv preprint arXiv:2307.15043.

- For **MasterKey**, the citation is:
  > Deng, G., Liu, Y., Li, Y., Wang, K., Zhang, Y., Li, Z., Wang, H., Zhang, T., & Liu, Y. (2023a). Jailbreaker: Automated jailbreak across multiple large language model chatbots. arXiv preprint arXiv:2307.08715.

With this information, I can now compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets used in the research.
