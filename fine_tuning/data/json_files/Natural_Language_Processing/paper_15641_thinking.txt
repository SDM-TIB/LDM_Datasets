To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Advancing the Search Frontier with AI Agents" by Ryen W. White, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections that discuss experiments or methodologies** to see if any datasets are explicitly referenced. The abstract provides a general overview of the paper's focus on AI agents and their implications for search tasks, but it does not mention specific datasets.

Next, I will examine the **main body of the paper**, particularly sections that discuss AI agents and their applications in search. I will look for any references to datasets used for training, evaluation, or experimentation. Since the paper discusses AI agents and their capabilities, it may reference datasets indirectly related to the development or evaluation of these agents.

I will also check the **References section** to see if any datasets are cited there, as sometimes datasets are referenced in the context of previous works or methodologies. If the paper discusses any specific datasets, I will ensure to note their names, descriptions, and any relevant details provided by the author.

If I find any datasets mentioned, I will then look for their full citations. This may involve searching for the original papers or sources where these datasets were introduced or described. It is crucial to provide accurate citations for each dataset to ensure proper attribution and facilitate further research.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details and that the information is presented clearly and accurately.
