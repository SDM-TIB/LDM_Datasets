To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Efficient Discovery and Effective Evaluation of Visual Perceptual Similarity: A Benchmark and Beyond" by Oren Barkan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the introduction of a large-scale fashion visual similarity benchmark dataset consisting of over 110K expert-annotated image pairs. This indicates that a significant dataset is present, and I need to find its details.

Next, I will look for specific sections that discuss datasets, particularly the **Methods** or **Experiments** sections. In the paper, the authors describe their dataset in detail in **section 5 (VSD benchmarks)**. Here, they mention two subsets of the DeepFashion dataset that they used for their benchmarks:

1. **In-shop Clothes Retrieval (ICR)**: This subset contains 52,712 images of clothes worn by models, showcasing various poses and scales.

2. **Consumer-to-shop Clothes Retrieval (CCR)**: This subset includes 239,557 images of clothes taken by consumers in real-world settings.

Both subsets are crucial for the experiments conducted in the paper, and they are explicitly named and described.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The DeepFashion dataset is cited as follows:

- For the **DeepFashion dataset**, the citation is:
  > Ziwei Liu, Ping Luo, Shi Qiu, Xiaogang Wang, and Xiaoou Tang. *Deepfashion: Powering robust clothes recognition and retrieval with rich annotations*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 1096–1104, 2016.

With this information, I can now summarize the datasets extracted from the paper:

1. **In-shop Clothes Retrieval (ICR)**: 52,712 images of clothes worn by models.
   - Citation: Ziwei Liu, Ping Luo, Shi Qiu, Xiaogang Wang, and Xiaoou Tang. *Deepfashion: Powering robust clothes recognition and retrieval with rich annotations*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 1096–1104, 2016.

2. **Consumer-to-shop Clothes Retrieval (CCR)**: 239,557 images of clothes taken by consumers.
   - Citation: Ziwei Liu, Ping Luo, Shi Qiu, Xiaogang Wang, and Xiaoou Tang. *Deepfashion: Powering robust clothes recognition and retrieval with rich annotations*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 1096–1104, 2016.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or analysis.
