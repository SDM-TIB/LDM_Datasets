To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fairness Explainability using Optimal Transport" by Philipp Ratz et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract discusses the application of their method in image classification, which suggests that there may be datasets used for experiments.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors mention using the **CelebA dataset** for their experiments. I will note down the details provided about this dataset, including its size and the attributes it contains.

In the **experiments section**, the authors describe the CelebA dataset as containing more than 200,000 celebrity images, each annotated with 40 attributes. This is a crucial detail that I need to include in my dataset description.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the CelebA dataset. The citation for the CelebA dataset is as follows:
> Ziwei Liu, Ping Luo, Xiaogang Wang, and Xiaoou Tang. *Deep learning face attributes in the wild*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision, pages 3730â€“3738, 2015.

Having gathered this information, I will compile the dataset entry for the CelebA dataset, ensuring that I include the full citation as required.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry in a structured format, ready for any further processing or review.
