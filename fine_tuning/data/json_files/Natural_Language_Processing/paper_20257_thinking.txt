To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Validating and Exploring Large Geographic Corpora" by Jonathan Dunn, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the text.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract and introduction** sections to get an overview of the datasets discussed. The abstract mentions a "427 billion word corpus derived from the Common Crawl," which indicates that this is a significant dataset. I will note this as the starting point.

Next, I will examine **section 3 (Data and Methods)**, where the author describes the main data source. Here, the "Corpus of Global Language Use (cglu; Dunn 2020)" is explicitly mentioned as the primary dataset. I will take note of this dataset and its citation.

In the same section, the author refers to "two sets of comparison corpora" used for validation. The first set consists of ground-truth language identification corpora from various sources, including:

1. **Bible translations** (Brown, 2014)
2. **Global Voices News** (Tiedemann, 2012)
3. **JW 300 dataset** (Agić and Vulić, 2019)
4. **Open Subtitles** (Lison and Tiedemann, 2016)
5. **QCRI Educational Domain** (Tiedemann, 2012)
6. **Tatoeba Sentences** (Tiedemann, 2012)
7. **Wikipedia articles**

I will need to gather full citations for these datasets from the references section.

The second set of comparison corpora consists of tweets collected from the same countries as the original cglu, which is also mentioned in section 3. This dataset is referred to as "geo-referenced tweets" and is used for validation purposes.

Next, I will check the **References section** to compile the full citations for each dataset:

7. For **Wikipedia articles**, I will note that the citation is not explicitly provided in the references, but it is a well-known source.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and that full citations are included. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
