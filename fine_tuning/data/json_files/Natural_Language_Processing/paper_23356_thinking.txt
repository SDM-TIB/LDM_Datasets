To extract datasets from the research paper titled "What Are Large Language Models Mapping to in the Brain? A Case Against Over-Reliance on Brain Scores" by Ebrahim Feghhi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and describe each dataset mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions analyzing "three neural datasets used in an impactful study on LLM-to-brain mappings," which indicates that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors specifically mention the three datasets: **Pereira fMRI dataset**, **Fedorenko ECoG dataset**, and **Blank fMRI dataset**. This section provides a clear indication of the datasets being utilized in their analyses.

In the **methods section**, the authors provide detailed descriptions of each dataset:

1. **Pereira fMRI Dataset**: This dataset consists of two experiments where participants read short passages. Experiment 1 includes 96 passages with 4 sentences each, and Experiment 2 includes 72 passages with 3 or 4 sentences each. The dataset is structured as a matrix of fMRI scans corresponding to the sentences read.

2. **Fedorenko ECoG Dataset**: This dataset involves participants reading isolated sentences while their neural activity is recorded via electrocorticography (ECoG). It consists of 52 sentences and captures high gamma activity across multiple electrodes.

3. **Blank fMRI Dataset**: Participants listened to short stories from the Natural Stories Corpus while their brain activity was recorded. The dataset includes fMRI scans taken every 2 seconds, resulting in a matrix of BOLD signals averaged across functional regions of interest.

I will then check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Pereira fMRI Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Francisco Pereira, Bin Lou, Brianna Pritchett, Samuel Ritter, Samuel J Gershman, Nancy Kanwisher, Matthew Botvinick, and Evelina Fedorenko. *Toward a universal decoder of linguistic meaning from brain activation*. Nat. Commun., 9(1):963, March 2018.

- For the **Fedorenko ECoG Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Evelina Fedorenko, Michael K Behr, and Nancy Kanwisher. *Functional specificity for high-level linguistic processing in the human brain*. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A., 108(39):16428â€“16433, September 2011.

- For the **Blank fMRI Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Richard Futrell, Edward Gibson, Harry J Tily, Idan Blank, Anastasia Vishnevetsky, Steven Piantadosi, and Evelina Fedorenko. *The natural stories corpus*. In Proceedings of the Eleventh International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC 2018), Miyazaki, Japan, May 2018. European Language Resources Association (ELRA).

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
