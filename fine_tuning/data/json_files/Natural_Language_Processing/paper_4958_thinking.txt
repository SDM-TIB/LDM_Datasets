To extract datasets from the research paper titled "edgar-corpus: Billions of Tokens Make The World Go Round" by Lefteris Loukas et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors released a novel corpus called **edgar-corpus**, which comprises annual reports from publicly traded companies in the US. This suggests that the dataset is significant and likely detailed in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors discuss the importance of financial documents from the SEC's EDGAR system. They mention that the **edgar-corpus** contains all 10-K filings from 1993 to 2020, which is a crucial detail for understanding the dataset's scope.

In the **methodology section**, the authors describe how they created the **edgar-corpus** by downloading and processing 10-K reports. They emphasize that this corpus includes all 20 sections of the annual reports, which further clarifies the dataset's structure and content.

I will also check the **experiments section** to see if the authors used the **edgar-corpus** for any specific tasks or analyses, which would confirm its application in research.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The primary dataset is the **edgar-corpus**, and I will ensure to include its citation:

- For **edgar-corpus**, the citation is:
  > Lefteris Loukas, Manos Fergadiotis, Ion Androutsopoulos, Prodromos Malakasiotis. *edgar-corpus: Billions of Tokens Make The World Go Round*. In Proceedings of the 1st Joint Workshop on Financial Narrative Processing and MultiLing Financial Summarisation, 2021.

Additionally, I will note that the authors mention the use of **edgar-crawler**, a toolkit for downloading and extracting reports, but this is not a dataset itself. 

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entry for **edgar-corpus** with its citation, ensuring that it is clear and ready for any structured output format that may be required later.
