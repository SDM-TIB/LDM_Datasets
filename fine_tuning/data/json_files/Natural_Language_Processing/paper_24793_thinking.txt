To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MindBench: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Mind Map Structure Recognition and Analysis" by Lei Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their full citations.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions the introduction of a new benchmark called **MindBench**, which suggests that there is a dataset associated with it. The introduction further elaborates on the need for a benchmark for structured document analysis, indicating that the authors have created a dataset for this purpose.

Next, I will look into **section 3 (The MindBench Dataset)**, where the authors describe the dataset in detail. This section outlines the data generation process, the types of data included, and the tasks designed for evaluation. Here, I will identify the specific datasets mentioned:

1. **Crawled Dataset**: This dataset is derived from real mind maps sourced from various platforms, including XMind, Biggerplate, and Zhixi. The authors provide statistics on the number of samples in training and testing sets.

2. **Synthetic Dataset**: This dataset is generated through a multi-step process, creating mind maps with diverse structures and layouts. The authors specify the number of samples used for different tasks.

In **section 3.3 (Statistic)**, the authors provide detailed statistics about the datasets, including the number of samples, languages, and types of tasks. This reinforces the existence of two distinct datasets: the crawled dataset and the synthetic dataset.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The authors reference several sources for the crawled data, which I will need to include in my dataset descriptions.

For the **Crawled Dataset**, the citations are:
- **XMind**: XMind. *XMind: The Most Popular Mind Mapping Software*. Available at: https://xmind.app/share/
- **Biggerplate**: Biggerplate. *Mind Map Library*. Available at: https://www.biggerplate.com/mindmap-library
- **Zhixi**: Zhixi. *Mind Map Space*. Available at: https://www.zhixi.com/space#src=btn

For the **Synthetic Dataset**, since it is generated by the authors, I will note that it does not have a formal citation but is described in detail in the paper.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for the crawled dataset sources and a description of the synthetic dataset. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for output, ensuring clarity and completeness for any further processing or review.
