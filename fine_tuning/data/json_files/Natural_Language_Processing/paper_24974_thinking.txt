To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Context-Aware Emotion Recognition: Debiasing from a Causal Demystification Perspective via De-confounded Training" by Dingkang Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on three datasets, which suggests that I should find specific names and details of these datasets.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Datasets and Evaluation Metrics)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention:

1. **EMOTIC Dataset**: This dataset is described as the first large-scale CAER benchmark containing 23,571 images of 34,320 annotated subjects, with emotion descriptors for multi-label classification and continuous dimensions.

2. **CAER-S Dataset**: This dataset consists of 70,000 static images captured from video clips, annotated with emotion categories for multi-class classification.

3. **GroupWalk Dataset**: This dataset includes 45 manually collected videos from real-world environments, annotated with discrete emotion categories for multi-label classification.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and will be formatted as follows:

- For the **EMOTIC Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Kosti, R., Alvarez, J. M., Recasens, A., & Lapedriza, A. (2019). Context based emotion recognition using EMOTIC dataset. *IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence*, 42(11), 2755-2766.

- For the **CAER-S Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yang, D., Huang, S., Kuang, H., Wang, Y., & Zhang, L. (2022). Context-aware emotion recognition networks. In *Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision* (pp. 10,143-10,152).

- For the **GroupWalk Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yang, D., Huang, S., Wang, S., & Zhang, L. (2020). GroupWalk: A dataset for emotion recognition in group interactions. In *Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Multimedia Expo* (pp. 1-6).

Now that I have gathered the dataset names and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that can be used for further processing or review. This will ensure that I have accurately captured all relevant details about the datasets used in the research paper.
