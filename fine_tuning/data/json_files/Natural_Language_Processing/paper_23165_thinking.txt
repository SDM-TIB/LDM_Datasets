To extract datasets from the research paper titled "3D Neural Edge Reconstruction" by Lei Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to gather initial insights about the datasets used. The abstract mentions that the method is evaluated on "multiple challenging datasets," which indicates that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4), where the authors typically provide detailed information about the datasets used for evaluation. In **Section 4.1 (Experiment Setting)**, the authors explicitly list four datasets:

1. **ABC-NEF Dataset**: This dataset consists of 115 CAD models, each with 50 observed images and ground truth parametric edges. The authors mention that they selected 82 CAD models for their experiments.

2. **DTU Dataset**: This dataset provides dense ground-truth point clouds. The authors selected 6 objects from this dataset that meet specific multi-view constraints.

3. **Replica Dataset**: This dataset contains high-quality indoor scenes, but the authors note that it lacks ground-truth edges, which they address through qualitative comparisons.

4. **Tanks & Temples Dataset**: This dataset includes real-world outdoor scenes and also lacks ground-truth edges, leading to qualitative comparisons among baselines.

To ensure accuracy, I will check the **References section** for full citations of these datasets:

- For the **ABC-NEF Dataset**, the citation is:

- For the **DTU Dataset**, the citation is:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. Each dataset will be clearly documented with its name, description, and full citation to ensure clarity and accuracy.
