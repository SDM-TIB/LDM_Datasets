To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Experimental Insights Towards Explainable and Interpretable Pedestrian Crossing Prediction" by A. N. Melo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their approach on the **PIE** and **JAAD** datasets, which is a strong indication that these datasets are central to their research.

Next, I will look closely at **section II (Related Work)**, where the authors discuss pedestrian action datasets. They explicitly mention the **JAAD Dataset** and the **PIE Dataset**. I will take note of the descriptions provided for each dataset, including their characteristics and the context in which they are used.

In **section II.B (Pedestrian Action Datasets)**, the authors provide detailed descriptions of both datasets:

1. **JAAD Dataset**: This dataset consists of 348 short video clips with various road actors and conditions. It includes annotations for pedestrian actions, with approximately 72% of pedestrians actively crossing the street.

2. **PIE Dataset**: This dataset contains over 300,000 labeled video frames recorded in Toronto under clear weather conditions. It includes annotations for all pedestrians near the road, regardless of whether they are crossing. The dataset shows an imbalance, with about 39.2% of pedestrians actively crossing.

To confirm the datasets used in their experiments, I will check **section IV (Implementation and Experimental Setup)**, where the authors mention that they utilized both the **JAAD** and **PIE** datasets for training and testing their model.

Now, I will refer to the **References section** to gather the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **JAAD Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Amir Rasouli, Iuliia Kotseruba, and John K. Tsotsos. *Are they going to cross? A benchmark dataset and baseline for pedestrian crosswalk behavior*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision Workshops, 2017, pp. 206–213.

- For the **PIE Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Amir Rasouli et al. *PIE: A Large-Scale Dataset and Models for Pedestrian Intention Estimation and Trajectory Prediction*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2019, pp. 6261–6270.

With this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will allow for a clear understanding of the datasets used in the research and their relevance to the study's findings.
