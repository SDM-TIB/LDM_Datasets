To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MultiPL-E: A Scalable and Extensible Approach to Benchmarking Neural Code Generation" by Federico Cassano et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the datasets discussed. The abstract mentions the creation of a "massively multilingual code generation benchmark" and specifically references two popular Python code generation benchmarks: **HumanEval** and **MBPP**. This indicates that these are key datasets to focus on.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors describe how they extend the HumanEval and MBPP benchmarks to 18 additional programming languages, which confirms that these two datasets are central to their research.

In the **experiments section**, the authors detail how they evaluate the performance of code generation models using these datasets. They provide insights into the structure and purpose of each dataset, which will be crucial for my documentation.

Now, I will gather the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. **HumanEval**: The original paper that introduced this dataset is:
   > Chen, M., Tworek, J., Jun, H., Yuan, Q., Pinto, H. P. d. O., Kaplan, J., Edwards, H., Burda, Y., Joseph, N., Brockman, G., et al. (2021). *Evaluating large language models trained on code*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2107.03374.

2. **MBPP**: The original paper that introduced this dataset is:
   > Austin, J., Odena, A., Nye, M., Bosma, J., Jiang, C., Cai, H., Michalewski, D., Dohan, E., Terry, Q., Le, Q. (2021). *Program synthesis with large language models*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2108.07732.

After identifying these datasets and their citations, I will summarize their key characteristics, such as the number of instances and the types of problems they contain, as described in the paper.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly presents each dataset along with its citation, ensuring that the documentation is comprehensive and useful for future reference.
