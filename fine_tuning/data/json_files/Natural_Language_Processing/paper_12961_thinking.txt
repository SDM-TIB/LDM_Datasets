To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Bio-SIEVE: Exploring Instruction Tuning Large Language Models for Systematic Review Automation" by Ambrose Robinson et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors release models, code, and a list of DOIs to reconstruct their dataset for reproducibility, indicating that there are datasets involved.

Next, I will focus on the **Methods section**, specifically looking for any explicit mentions of datasets. In this section, the authors describe the **Instruct Cochrane Dataset**, which consists of 7,330 medical systematic reviews gathered from the Cochrane Reviews website. This dataset includes objectives, selection criteria, and information on included and excluded studies, along with reasons for exclusion.

I will also check the **Results section** for any additional datasets or subsets mentioned. The authors discuss various subsets derived from the Instruct Cochrane Dataset, including a **Review Subset** and an **Irrelevancy Test Set**. The Review Subset consists of 1,711 individual samples from 13 reviews, while the Irrelevancy Test Set is constructed to evaluate the model's ability to exclude irrelevant submissions.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper does not provide specific citations for the datasets themselves, but it does reference the Cochrane Reviews as the source of the Instruct Cochrane Dataset. Therefore, I will cite the Cochrane Library as follows:

- **Cochrane Reviews**: Cochrane Library. *Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews*. Available at: https://www.cochranelibrary.com/

Next, I will summarize the datasets identified:

1. **Instruct Cochrane Dataset**: A dataset containing 7,330 medical systematic reviews, including objectives, selection criteria, and information on included and excluded studies.
   - Citation: Cochrane Library. *Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews*. Available at: https://www.cochranelibrary.com/

2. **Review Subset**: A subset of the Instruct Cochrane Dataset containing 1,711 individual samples from 13 reviews.
   - Citation: Cochrane Library. *Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews*. Available at: https://www.cochranelibrary.com/

3. **Irrelevancy Test Set**: A dataset constructed to evaluate the model's ability to exclude irrelevant submissions, paired with abstracts from distinct topics.
   - Citation: Cochrane Library. *Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews*. Available at: https://www.cochranelibrary.com/

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
