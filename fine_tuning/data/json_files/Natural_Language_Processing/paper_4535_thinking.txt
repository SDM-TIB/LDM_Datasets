To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Diachronic Analysis of German Parliamentary Proceedings: Ideological Shifts through the Lens of Political Biases" by Tobias Walter et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates the use of a new corpus of German parliamentary proceedings called **DEUPARL**, which spans from 1867 to 2020. This suggests that DEUPARL is a significant dataset for the research.

Next, I will look into the **methodology** and **experiments** sections, particularly focusing on any specific details about the DEUPARL corpus. In section II, the authors describe DEUPARL in detail, including its sources and the preprocessing steps taken. They mention that DEUPARL is built from two main sources: the **Reichstagsprotokolle** and the **Bundestagsprotokolle**.

1. **DEUPARL Corpus**: This is the primary dataset used in the study, consisting of German parliamentary proceedings from 1867 to 2020. The authors provide a link to access the dataset: https://tudatalib.ulb.tu-darmstadt.de/handle/tudatalib/2889.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for DEUPARL. However, since DEUPARL is a newly created dataset by the authors, it may not have a traditional citation like other datasets. Instead, I will note the authors' mention of the dataset and its availability.

Next, I will also look for any other datasets mentioned in the paper. The authors discuss various temporal splits of the DEUPARL corpus, but these are not separate datasets; they are subdivisions of the main DEUPARL dataset based on historical periods.

After reviewing the entire paper, I conclude that the only dataset explicitly mentioned is DEUPARL. I will compile the information as follows:

- **Dataset Name**: DEUPARL
- **Description**: A historical corpus of German parliamentary proceedings covering the period from 1867 to 2020, built from the protocols of both the German Reichstag and the Bundestag.
- **Access Link**: https://tudatalib.ulb.tu-darmstadt.de/handle/tudatalib/2889

Finally, I will ensure that I have the correct citation format for DEUPARL, which is as follows:
> Walter, T., Kirschner, C., Eger, S., Glava≈°, G., Lauscher, A., & Ponzetto, S. P. (2023). *Diachronic Analysis of German Parliamentary Proceedings: Ideological Shifts through the Lens of Political Biases*. 

Now, I will prepare to present this information in the required format for further processing or review.
