To extract datasets from the research paper titled "HFN: Heterogeneous Feature Network for Multivariate Time Series Anomaly Detection" by Jun Zhan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on **four sensor datasets**, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors provide a statistical overview of the datasets used. They mention three datasets:

1. **SWaT Dataset**: This dataset is collected from a six-stage Secure Water Treatment testbed. It consists of 51 time-series features, including both continuous and discrete variables, and was collected over 11 days.

2. **WADI Dataset**: This dataset is from a water distribution testbed and contains 123 time-series features. The data were collected over 16 days, with attacks launched during the last two days to generate abnormal operating data.

3. **WTD Dataset**: This dataset is collected from a large-scale wind farm, containing 37 time-series features. The data were collected over 1 to 2 years, with no abnormal data during the training stage.

In the **table summarizing the datasets**, I will note the key statistics such as the number of features, the training and testing dataset sizes, and the anomaly rates.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This structured approach will help in creating a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
