To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Exploiting the Value of Past Success in Off-Policy Actor-Critic" by Tianying Ji et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art methods across various continuous control tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they mention evaluating their algorithm on several benchmark tasks, specifically:

1. **MuJoCo**: A physics engine for continuous control tasks, which includes various environments like Humanoid, Ant, and Swimmer.
2. **DMControl**: A suite of continuous control tasks that includes complex environments like DogRun and HumanoidRun.
3. **Meta-World**: A benchmark for multi-task and meta reinforcement learning, which includes various manipulation tasks.
4. **Adroit**: A set of dexterous manipulation tasks using a robotic hand.
5. **MyoSuite**: A suite for testing reinforcement learning algorithms in controlling musculoskeletal systems.
6. **ROBEL**: A platform for real-world robotic learning tasks.

I will then check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets or the papers that describe them. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant datasets from the paper.
