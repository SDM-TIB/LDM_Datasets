To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Task-specific Bottom Representation Network for Multi-Task Recommendation" by Qi Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that experiments were conducted on "one public dataset and one industrial dataset," which indicates that there are datasets to be identified. I will look for specific names or descriptions of these datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4), particularly **subsection 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors are likely to provide detailed information about the datasets used in their experiments. Here, I will look for the names of the datasets, their characteristics, and any relevant statistics that describe their content.

In this paper, the authors mention two datasets:

1. **E-commerce Dataset**: This dataset is collected from Alibabaâ€™s micro-video e-commerce platform, containing traffic logs for various user interactions. It includes statistics such as the number of samples, features, users, items, and specific user actions like watch, click, entering, and conversion.

2. **Tenrec Dataset**: This dataset consists of user logs from an industrial platform, specifically a subset named QK-Video-1M. It includes user interactions such as click, follow, like, and share, along with statistics about the number of samples and user behavior sequences.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and will typically include the authors, title, publication venue, and year of publication.

For the **E-commerce Dataset**, the citation is not explicitly provided in the paper, but it is derived from the authors' work at Alibaba, which may not have a formal citation. However, I can note that it is an internal dataset used for their experiments.

For the **Tenrec Dataset**, the authors provide a link to the dataset: 
> Tenrec dataset: https://github.com/yuangh-x/2022-NIPS-Tenrec

This link serves as a reference for the dataset, and I will include it in the citation.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the names of the datasets, their descriptions, and the citations as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
