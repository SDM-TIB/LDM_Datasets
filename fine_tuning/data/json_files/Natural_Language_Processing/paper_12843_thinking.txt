To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Simple Synthetic Data Reduces Sycophancy in Large Language Models" by Jerry Wei et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions a synthetic-data intervention, which suggests that there may be datasets involved in the intervention process. I will look for any specific datasets mentioned in these sections.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly where the authors describe the data generation process. They mention using input-label pairs from **17 publicly-available NLP datasets from Hugging Face**. This is a strong indication that multiple datasets are utilized, and I need to identify each one.

In the **results section**, I will check if the authors provide any additional context or results related to the datasets used. This may include performance metrics or comparisons that could help clarify the datasets' significance.

Now, I will compile a list of the datasets mentioned in the paper. The authors specifically list the following datasets in **Table 4**:

Finally, I will ensure to format these citations correctly and compile them into a structured list for easy reference. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, along with their full citations.
