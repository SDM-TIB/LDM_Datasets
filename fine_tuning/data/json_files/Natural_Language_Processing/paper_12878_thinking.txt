To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Answering Unseen Questions With Smaller Language Models Using Rationale Generation and Dense Retrieval" by Tim Hartill et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their methods on various unseen evaluation datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be discussed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly the parts that describe the experiments and datasets used. In this paper, the authors mention several datasets in the context of their experiments. I will look for sections that explicitly list or describe these datasets, such as **section 3 (Experiments)** and **section 2 (Method)**.

Upon reviewing the relevant sections, I find the following datasets mentioned:

1. **StrategyQA**: This dataset is referenced as a benchmark for evaluating reasoning capabilities in unseen settings. The authors mention it in the context of their evaluation metrics.
   
2. **CommonsenseQA**: Another dataset used for evaluating the performance of their models, focusing on commonsense reasoning questions.

3. **ARC-DA**: This dataset is highlighted as a direct-answer reasoning challenge, which the authors utilize for their experiments.

4. **IIRC**: This dataset is mentioned as containing factual questions that require additional context for answering.

5. **Musique**: This dataset is noted for its multi-hop factual questions, which are relevant for the authors' evaluation.

Next, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each of these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for future researchers.

The full citations I find are:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their full citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or analysis. This process ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets referenced in the paper along with their proper citations.
