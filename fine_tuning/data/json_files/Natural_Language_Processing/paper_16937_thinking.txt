To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Activating Frequency and ViT for 3D Point Cloud Quality Assessment Without Reference" by Oussama Messai et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that experiments were conducted on three datasets: **ICIP20**, **PointXR**, and a new dataset called **BASICS**. This is a good starting point for my extraction.

Next, I will delve into the **experimental results section** (Section 3) where the authors provide a detailed description of the datasets used. Here, I will look for specific details about each dataset, including their characteristics and the context in which they were used.

1. **ICIP20 Dataset**: The authors mention that this dataset contains 6 reference point clouds, from which 90 degraded copies were created using three different compression methods. This dataset is crucial for evaluating the proposed method.

2. **PointXR Dataset**: This dataset consists of 5 point clouds, with 45 degraded versions created. It is also highlighted as a well-known dataset in the field, which adds to its significance.

3. **BASICS Dataset**: The authors describe BASICS as the largest dataset currently available, containing 75 reference point clouds. Each point cloud was compressed using four distinct compression methods, resulting in 1494 processed point clouds. This dataset is particularly important as it was part of the ICIP 2023 Grand Challenge on Point Cloud Quality Assessment.

Now, I will refer to the **References section** to gather the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **ICIP20 Dataset**, the citation is:

- For the **PointXR Dataset**, the citation is:

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
