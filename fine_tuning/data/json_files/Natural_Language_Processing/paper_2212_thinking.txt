To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Analyze the Effects of Weighting Functions on Cost Function in the GloVe Model" by Trieu Hai Nguyen, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the challenges of training the GloVe model with large datasets but does not specify any dataset names. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (The comparison between models)**, where the author mentions using the **text8 dataset** for testing the GloVe model with different weighting functions. This section provides specific details about the dataset, including its size (100MB), the vocabulary size (71,290), the number of unique words (253,854), and the total number of tokens (17,005,207). This is a clear indication that the text8 dataset is relevant for the experiments conducted in the paper.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the text8 dataset. The paper mentions that the dataset is available at a specific URL, which is helpful for providing a complete reference.

The citation for the text8 dataset is:
> Mahoney, M. (2006). *Text8 Dataset*. Available at: http://mattmahoney.net/dc/textdata.html.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity.

In summary, the steps I took include:
1. Reading through the abstract and introduction to identify any mentions of datasets.
2. Focusing on the methodology section to find specific datasets used in experiments.
3. Documenting the details of the text8 dataset, including its size and characteristics.
4. Retrieving the full citation for the dataset from the references.

With this information, I am ready to create the dataset entry for the text8 dataset.
