To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Testing for Stationary or Persistent Coefficient Randomness in Predictive Regressions" by Mikihito Nishi, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses applying tests to the U.S. stock returns data, which suggests that there may be a specific dataset referenced.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any explicit mentions of datasets. The introduction discusses the context of stock return predictability and references previous studies, but I need to look for specific datasets used in the analysis.

In the **experiments section**, I will look for any detailed descriptions of datasets used for empirical analysis. The paper mentions applying tests to the U.S. stock returns data, specifically stating that the data spans from January 1927 to December 2014 and includes 14 financial variables. This indicates that there is a dataset being utilized for the empirical application.

I will also check the **references section** to find any citations related to the datasets mentioned. The paper cites Amit Goyalâ€™s webpage as the source for the data, which is crucial for providing a full citation.

The relevant dataset extracted from the paper is:

1. **U.S. Stock Returns Data**: This dataset includes monthly data spanning from January 1927 to December 2014, comprising 14 financial variables used for testing predictability.

The full citation for the dataset is:
> Goyal, A. (n.d.). *Data for Predictive Regression Analysis*. Retrieved from https://sites.google.com/view/agoyal145

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry in a structured format, ensuring that the citation is included for proper attribution. This process will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets referenced in the research paper.
