To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Boosting AND/OR-Based Computational Protein Design: Dynamic Heuristics and Generalizable UFO" by Bobak Pezeshki et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the introduction of new versions of the AOBB-K* algorithm and mentions empirical analysis on "62 real protein benchmarks." This indicates that there are datasets involved, but I need to find specific names and details.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments or results sections**. In the introduction, the authors mention "62 real protein benchmarks" but do not specify their names. I will need to find these in the later sections.

Upon reviewing the **empirical evaluation section**, I find that the authors refer to benchmarks derived from protein redesign problems provided by the Bruce Donald Lab at Duke University. They describe the naming convention for the benchmarks (e.g., d[g]-[M]-[p]), but they do not provide a comprehensive list of the datasets or their full citations.

To ensure I have the correct citations, I will check the **References section** for any papers or resources that might describe these benchmarks in detail. The references include works by Bruce Donald and others that may provide context or additional information about the datasets used.

The relevant citations for the datasets mentioned in the paper are:

1. **Protein Design Benchmarks**: The benchmarks are derived from problems provided by the Bruce Donald Lab at Duke University. However, the specific citation for these benchmarks is not provided in the paper. I will note that the authors refer to their previous work for more details.

2. **General Reference for Protein Design**:
   > Bruce Donald. *Algorithms in Structural Molecular Biology*. MIT Press, 2011.

Since the paper does not provide explicit citations for the 62 benchmarks, I will summarize the information I have gathered and note that the datasets are derived from the Bruce Donald Lab, and I will reference the general work on protein design by Bruce Donald.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for clarity and future reference.
