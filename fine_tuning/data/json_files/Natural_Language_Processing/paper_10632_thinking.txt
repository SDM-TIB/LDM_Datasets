To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Personalized DP-SGD using Sampling Mechanisms" by Geon Heo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses experiments on real datasets, which indicates that datasets are likely to be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors mention using three benchmark datasets: **MNIST**, **SVHN**, and **Fashion-MNIST**. I will note down the details provided for each dataset, including their characteristics and any specific information relevant to their use in the experiments.

In the **experiments section**, the authors describe the datasets as follows:

1. **MNIST**: A dataset containing images of handwritten digits, widely used for benchmarking machine learning algorithms.
2. **SVHN**: A dataset containing images of street view house numbers, also commonly used in machine learning tasks.
3. **Fashion-MNIST**: A dataset consisting of images of various types of clothing, serving as a more challenging alternative to MNIST.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **MNIST**, the citation is:
  > Deng, L. (2012). The MNIST database of handwritten digit images for machine learning research. *IEEE Signal Processing Magazine*, 29(6), 141-142.

- For **SVHN**, the citation is:
  > Netzer, Y., Wang, T., Coates, A., Bissacco, A., Wu, B., & Ng, A. Y. (2011). Reading digits in natural images with unsupervised feature learning. In *NIPS Workshop on Deep Learning and Unsupervised Feature Learning*.

- For **Fashion-MNIST**, the citation is:
  > Xiao, H., Rasul, K., & Vollgraf, R. (2017). Fashion-MNIST: A novel image dataset for benchmarking machine learning algorithms. *CoRR*, abs/1708.07747.

With these citations, I have gathered all necessary information regarding the datasets used in the paper. I will now compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
