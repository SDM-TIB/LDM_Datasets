To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Scaling Studies for Efficient Parameter Search and Parallelism for Large Language Model Pre-training" by Michael Benington et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the challenges of training large language models (LLMs) and hints at the use of various models and hyperparameters, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets.

Next, I will examine the **experiments and results sections** for any references to datasets used in the study. The paper focuses on the performance of different models and hyperparameter configurations, but it does not provide specific datasets that were utilized for training or evaluation.

Since the paper emphasizes the use of the **mt5-XXL model** and mentions trials conducted across different configurations, I will look for any references to datasets in the context of these trials. However, the text does not specify any particular datasets used for training the models.

I will also check the **references section** to see if any datasets are cited indirectly through the works referenced. The references primarily discuss optimization techniques and previous studies related to model training but do not provide specific dataset citations.

After thoroughly reviewing the paper, it appears that there are no explicit datasets mentioned or cited in the text. The focus is more on the methodologies and performance metrics rather than on specific datasets.

In conclusion, since no datasets are identified in the paper, I will not be able to provide full citations for datasets as there are none to extract. If there were datasets mentioned, I would have followed the steps of identifying them in the relevant sections, confirming their usage in experiments, and then retrieving their full citations from the references section. However, in this case, the paper does not include any datasets for extraction.
