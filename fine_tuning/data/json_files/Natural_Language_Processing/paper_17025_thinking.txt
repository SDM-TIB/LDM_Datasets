To extract datasets from the research paper titled "FAIRSISA: Ensemble Post-Processing to Improve Fairness of Unlearning in LLMs" by Swanand Ravindra Kadhe et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of the SISA framework and mentions the use of a benchmark dataset for toxic text classification, which suggests that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this paper, the authors mention the **HateXplain dataset** as a benchmark for hate speech detection. They provide details about the dataset, including its size (20,000 posts) and the types of annotations it contains (fine-grained annotations for religion, race, and gender).

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the HateXplain dataset. The relevant citation is:

- For **HateXplain Dataset**:
  > Binny Mathew, Punyajoy Saha, Seid Muhie Yimam, Chris Biemann, Pawan Goyal, and Animesh Mukherjee. *HateXplain: A Benchmark Dataset for Explainable Hate Speech Detection*. In Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, volume 35, pp. 14867â€“14875, 2021.

Since this is the only dataset mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information about the HateXplain dataset, including its description and citation.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry in the required format, ensuring that the full citation is included for clarity and proper attribution. This structured approach will ensure that I capture all necessary details about the dataset used in the research.
