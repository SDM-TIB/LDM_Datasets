To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ARE WE FALLING IN A MIDDLE-INTELLIGENCE TRAP? AN ANALYSIS AND MITIGATION OF THE REVERSAL CURSE" by Ang Lv et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the reversal curse in large language models (LLMs) and hints at experiments conducted, which may involve datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors reference previous works and their evaluations. They mention the reversal curse and cite Berglund et al. (2023), which suggests that there may be a dataset associated with their findings.

In the **methodology section**, particularly in the experiment design part, the authors describe a dataset used for evaluating the reversal curse. They mention a dataset proposed by Berglund et al. (2023) that consists of sentences structured as “<name> is <description>” and its reverse. This dataset is crucial for understanding the reversal curse and is explicitly detailed in the paper.

The paper states that the training dataset encompasses a total of **3,600 training samples**, and the test set includes various subtasks, each containing **300 test samples**. This indicates that the dataset is well-defined and structured for the experiments.

Now, I will look into the **references section** to find the full citation for the dataset mentioned. The dataset is attributed to Berglund et al. (2023), so I will extract the complete citation from the references:

- For the dataset proposed by Berglund et al. (2023), the citation is:
  > Lukas Berglund, Meg Tong, Max Kaufmann, Mikita Balesni, Asa Cooper Stickland, Tomasz Korbak, and Owain Evans. *The reversal curse: LLMs trained on “a is b” fail to learn “b is a”*. 2023.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the dataset details, including its structure and purpose, and ensure that I include the full citation for proper attribution.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that is ready for review or further processing, ensuring that all necessary details are included for clarity and completeness.
