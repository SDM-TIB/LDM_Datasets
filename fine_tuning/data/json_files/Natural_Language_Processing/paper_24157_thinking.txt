To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MOYU: A Theoretical Study on Massive Over-activation Yielded Uplifts in LLMs" by Chi Ma et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections that discuss experiments or methodologies** to find any references to datasets. The abstract primarily discusses the MOYU property and dynamic activation strategies without mentioning specific datasets, so I will move on to the introduction.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss various techniques related to Massive Over-activation Yielded Uplifts (MOYU) but do not specify any datasets. I will continue to the **related works section** and the **main body of the paper** to see if any datasets are referenced in the context of experiments or theoretical analysis.

Upon reviewing the **related works section**, I notice that the authors cite several previous studies and methods but still do not mention specific datasets. I will check the **conclusion and limitations** section as well, as sometimes datasets are referenced in the context of future work or limitations of the current study.

After thoroughly reviewing the paper, it appears that there are no explicit datasets mentioned or utilized in the experiments or analyses presented in this paper. The focus is primarily on theoretical concepts and existing methods rather than empirical data derived from specific datasets.

Since no datasets are identified in the paper, I will not need to compile any dataset entries or citations. However, I will ensure to note that the paper does not provide any datasets for reference.

In summary, I will document that the paper does not include any datasets, and therefore, there are no citations to extract. This will be important for anyone reviewing the paper for dataset information.
