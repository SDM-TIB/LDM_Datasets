To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Progressive Classifier and Feature Extractor Adaptation for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation on Point Clouds" by Zicheng Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors validate their method on "popular benchmark datasets," which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names and characteristics.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention two benchmark datasets:

1. **PointDA-10 Dataset**: This dataset is referenced multiple times throughout the experiments, indicating it is a significant dataset for their evaluations.

2. **GraspNetPC-10 Dataset**: This dataset is also mentioned in the context of validating the effectiveness of their method, suggesting it is another key dataset used in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. This is crucial as proper citation is necessary for any dataset mentioned in the paper.

- For the **PointDA-10 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Wang, Y., et al. "PointDA: A Multi-Scale 3D Domain Adaptation Network for Point Cloud Representation." In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 32, 2019.

- For the **GraspNetPC-10 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Fang, H.S., et al. "GraspNet-1Billion: A Large-Scale Benchmark for General Object Grasping." In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2020.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited according to the requirements of the task. This will involve creating a structured output that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations.
