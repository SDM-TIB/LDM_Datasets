To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Unveiling Themes in Judicial Proceedings: A Cross-Country Study Using Topic Modeling on Legal Documents from India and the UK" by Krish Didwania et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a general overview, but the methodology section is likely to contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used.

In **section 3.1 (Dataset)**, the authors describe three datasets:

1. **Indian Abstractive Dataset (IN-Abs)**: This dataset consists of 7,130 Indian Supreme Court judgments obtained from the Legal Information Institute of India website, each with corresponding abstractive summaries. The average length of these documents is 5,389 tokens.

2. **Indian Extractive Dataset (IN-Ext)**: This dataset was created based on feedback from legal experts. It includes annotations from two LLB graduates on 50 Indian Supreme Court case documents, providing extractive summaries for each segment.

3. **UK Abstractive Dataset (UK-Abs)**: This dataset comprises 793 case documents from the UK Supreme Court website, each with official press summaries. The average length of these documents is 14,296 tokens.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. However, the paper does not provide specific citations for the datasets themselves, as they are derived from publicly available sources (Legal Information Institute of India and UK Supreme Court website). Therefore, I will note the sources as follows:

- For the **Indian Abstractive Dataset (IN-Abs)**, the citation can be referenced as:
  > Legal Information Institute of India. *Supreme Court Judgments*. [Link to the website]

- For the **Indian Extractive Dataset (IN-Ext)**, since it is based on expert annotations, I will note:
  > Expert annotations based on Indian Supreme Court case documents.

- For the **UK Abstractive Dataset (UK-Abs)**, the citation can be referenced as:
  > UK Supreme Court. *Official Press Summaries*. [Link to the website]

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the descriptions and citations as outlined above. This will prepare the information for structured output or further processing.
