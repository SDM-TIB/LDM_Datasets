To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Andes: Defining and Enhancing Quality-of-Experience in LLM-Based Text Streaming Services" by Jiachen Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a high-level overview, but I will need to dig deeper into the body of the paper for specific dataset details.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where datasets are typically described. In this paper, the authors mention using the **ShareGPT dataset** and the **Multi-Round ShareGPT dataset** for their evaluations. I will look for specific details about these datasets, such as their characteristics, size, and how they were used in the experiments.

In the **experiments section**, the authors describe the ShareGPT dataset as a collection of conversations shared by users with ChatGPT, which includes multiple rounds of input prompts and output responses. The Multi-Round ShareGPT dataset is created by concatenating multiple rounds of conversations into one input while limiting its length to fit the modelâ€™s maximum context length.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For the **ShareGPT dataset**, the citation is:
> ShareGPT Team. *ShareGPT*. https://sharegpt.com/.

For the **Multi-Round ShareGPT dataset**, since it is derived from the ShareGPT dataset, I will use the same citation, as it is essentially a modified version of the original dataset.

After gathering all this information, I will summarize the datasets in a clear format, ensuring that I include the full citations as required.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that is ready for review or further processing.
