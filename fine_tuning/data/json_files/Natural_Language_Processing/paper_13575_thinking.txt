To extract datasets from the research paper titled "FastPoseGait: A Toolbox and Benchmark for Efficient Pose-based Gait Recognition" by Shibei Meng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and datasets sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the toolbox supports various benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are included. 

Next, I will focus on **section 2.2 (Supported Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used in their experiments. Here, I will identify each dataset mentioned and take note of their descriptions:

1. **CASIA-B**: This dataset consists of 124 subjects under three distinct walking conditions, with 11 sequences captured from different viewpoints. 

2. **OUMVLP-Pose**: Built on the OUMVLP dataset, it includes 10,307 subjects from 14 viewpoints and provides 18-keypoint pose data.

3. **GREW**: A large-scale dataset with 26,345 individuals captured by 882 cameras in real-world settings, providing pose information of 17 keypoints.

4. **Gait3D**: Collected by 39 cameras in a fixed real-world environment, this dataset consists of 4,000 subjects and includes pose information of 17 keypoints.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **CASIA-B**, the citation is:

- For **GREW**, the citation is:

- For **Gait3D**, the citation is:

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described with its full citation. This will allow for a clear and organized presentation of the datasets used in the research.
