To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Exact objectives of random linear programs and mean widths of random polyhedrons" by Mihailo Stojnic, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract provides a concise overview of the study's focus, which is on random linear programs and their connection to the mean widths of random polyhedrons. However, it does not explicitly mention any datasets. The introduction may provide more context or references to datasets used in the research.

Next, I will examine the **methodology and results sections**. These sections typically contain detailed descriptions of the experiments conducted and any datasets utilized. I will look for any specific mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

If the paper includes a **section dedicated to experiments or numerical results**, I will pay close attention to this part, as it often lists the datasets used for validation or testing purposes. I will note any datasets mentioned, including their specific attributes, such as the number of samples, types of data, and any relevant details about how they were collected or generated.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. I will ensure that I capture the complete citation format, including authors, title, publication venue, and year.

If the paper references any datasets from other studies, I will also look up those studies to obtain their full citations. This may involve searching for the original papers or datasets mentioned in the references.

Finally, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited. This will include the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation for each dataset.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets referenced in the paper, maintaining a focus on clarity and proper citation practices.
