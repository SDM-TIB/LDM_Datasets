To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Uniform Convergence of Adversarially Robust Classifiers" by Rachel Morris and Ryan Murray, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a concise overview, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used in the research.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments or results sections**. This is where authors typically describe the datasets they used for training and evaluation. I will pay close attention to any specific names, descriptions, or characteristics of the datasets.

If the paper includes a **table or figure** summarizing the datasets, I will note that information as well. Additionally, I will check the **references section** for any citations related to the datasets. This is crucial for obtaining the full citations needed for each dataset.

Once I identify the datasets, I will ensure to extract the following information for each:

1. **Dataset Name**: The official name of the dataset.
2. **Description**: A brief description of the dataset, including its purpose and any relevant details such as size, number of samples, and features.
3. **Full Citation**: The complete reference for the dataset, including authors, title, publication venue, and year.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like "CIFAR-10," I would look for its description in the text and then find its citation in the references.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its name, description, and full citation.

Finally, I will prepare the information in a structured format for easy access and review, ensuring that all datasets are properly documented for future reference or analysis.
