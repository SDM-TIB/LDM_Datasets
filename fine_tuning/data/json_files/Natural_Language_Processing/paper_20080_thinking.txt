To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Can we obtain significant success in RST discourse parsing by using Large Language Models?" by Aru Maekawa et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental settings sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. In the abstract, the authors refer to "three benchmark datasets, RST-DT, Instr-DT, and the GUM corpus," indicating that these are the datasets used in their experiments.

Next, I will look into the **experimental settings section** (section 4) where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets. Here, they describe:

1. **RST-DT**: This dataset contains 385 documents selected from the Wall Street Journal, divided into training and test sets. The authors mention that it uses 18 coarse rhetorical relations derived from 78 fine-grained ones.

2. **Instr-DT**: This dataset consists of 176 documents obtained from home-repair instruction manuals, with 39 rhetorical relations. The authors specify the division of documents into training, development, and test sets.

3. **GUM Corpus**: This corpus includes 213 documents across 12 genres, with a specific division for training, development, and test datasets. The authors also mention that they translated rhetorical relation labels in the GUM corpus to match those in RST-DT.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:

- For **RST-DT**, the citation is:
  > Lynn Carison, Daniel Marcu. *RST Discourse Treebank*. Philadelphia: Linguistic Data Consortium, 2002.

- For **Instr-DT**, the citation is:
  > Rajen Subba, Barbara Di Eugenio. *An effective discourse parser that uses rich linguistic information*. In Proceedings of Human Language Technologies: The 2009 Annual Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics, pages 566–574, Boulder, Colorado, 2009.

- For **GUM Corpus**, the citation is:
  > Amir Zeldes. *The GUM corpus: Creating multilayer resources in the classroom*. Language Resources and Evaluation, 51(3):581–612, 2017.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
