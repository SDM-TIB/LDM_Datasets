To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Extracting Multi-valued Relations from Language Models" by Sneha Singhania et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiment sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors reference the LAMA framework and mention the use of multi-valued relations, which suggests that datasets related to these relations may be discussed later in the paper.

Next, I will examine **section 4 (Experiment)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. They state that they chose seven diverse multi-valued relations appearing in the LAMA benchmark and sampled subjects and objects from the popular Wikidata knowledge base.

The specific datasets mentioned are:

1. **LAMA Benchmark**: This benchmark is used for evaluating the extraction of multi-valued relations from language models. It includes various relations and subjects sampled from Wikidata.

2. **Wikidata Knowledge Base**: The authors sampled approximately 200 subjects and a complete list of objects from this knowledge base for their experiments.

Now, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **LAMA Benchmark**, the citation is:
  > Fabio Petroni, Tim Rocktäschel, Sebastian Riedel, Patrick Lewis, Anton Bakhtin, Yuxiang Wu, and Alexander Miller. *Language Models as Knowledge Bases?* In Proceedings of the 2019 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing and the 9th International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing (EMNLP-IJCNLP), pages 2463–2473, Hong Kong, China. Association for Computational Linguistics.

- For **Wikidata**, the citation is:
  > Denny Vrandečić and Markus Krötzsch. *Wikidata: A Free Collaborative Knowledge Base*. Communications of ACM, 57:78–85, 2014.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited, ready for structured output or further analysis.
