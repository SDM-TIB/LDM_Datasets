To extract datasets from the research paper titled "GluMarker: A Novel Predictive Modeling of Glycemic Control Through Digital Biomarkers" by Ziyi Zhou et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that GluMarker achieves state-of-the-art performance on **Anderson’s dataset** for predicting next-day glycemic control. This indicates that there is at least one dataset that I need to extract.

Next, I will look into the **Methods** section, specifically under **Dataset Description and Pre-processing**. Here, the authors explicitly state that they conducted experiments on **Anderson’s dataset**, which contains real records of 30 diabetics. This section provides a clear identification of the dataset used in their research.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for Anderson’s dataset. The citation is as follows:
> S. M. Anderson, D. Raghinaru, J. E. Pinsker, F. Boscari, E. Renard, B. A. Buckingham, R. Nimri, F. J. Doyle III, S. A. Brown, P. Keith-Hynes et al. "Multinational home use of closed-loop control is safe and effective." *Diabetes care*, vol. 39, no. 7, pp. 1143–1150, 2016.

Since Anderson’s dataset is the only dataset mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format.

Now, I will summarize the dataset details:
1. **Dataset Name**: Anderson’s dataset
   - **Description**: Contains real records of 30 diabetics used for predicting next-day glycemic control.
   - **Full Citation**: S. M. Anderson, D. Raghinaru, J. E. Pinsker, F. Boscari, E. Renard, B. A. Buckingham, R. Nimri, F. J. Doyle III, S. A. Brown, P. Keith-Hynes et al. "Multinational home use of closed-loop control is safe and effective." *Diabetes care*, vol. 39, no. 7, pp. 1143–1150, 2016.

With this information, I am now ready to create the dataset entry in the required format for further processing or review.
