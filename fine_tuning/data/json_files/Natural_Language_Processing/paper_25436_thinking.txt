To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ROLeR: Effective Reward Shaping in Offline Reinforcement Learning for Recommender Systems" by Yi Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that extensive experiments were conducted on four benchmark datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will look into **section 6.1.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used in their experiments. Here, I will find the following datasets:

1. **KuaiRec**: This dataset is described as a video dataset containing a fully-observed user-item interaction matrix used for evaluation. The normalized viewing time of a video serves as the reward signal.

2. **KuaiRand-Pure**: This dataset contains user-item interactions collected by randomly inserting target videos into the standard recommendation stream. The "is_click" signal is used as the reward.

3. **Coat**: A shopping dataset consisting of user ratings on self-selected and uniformly sampled items, with ratings serving as reward signals.

4. **Yahoo**: A music dataset similar to Coat, where user ratings on selected items are used for training, and ratings on randomly picked items are used for testing.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:

Now that I have gathered the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations.
