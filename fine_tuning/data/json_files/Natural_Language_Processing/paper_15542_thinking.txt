To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards A Holistic Landscape of Situated Theory of Mind in Large Language Models" by Ziqiao Ma et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract discusses the need for new benchmarks for evaluating Theory of Mind (ToM) in large language models (LLMs), which suggests that datasets may be involved.

Next, I will focus on the **section detailing the tasks and experiments**. This section is likely to provide specific information about the datasets used for evaluation. I will look for any named datasets or references to existing benchmarks that are utilized in the experiments.

In the **task settings and data collection section**, the authors describe various tasks designed to evaluate ToM in LLMs. They mention using **MiniGrid**, a 2D grid-world environment, as a setting for their experiments. This indicates that MiniGrid is a dataset or environment used for their evaluations.

Additionally, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets or benchmarks mentioned throughout the paper. This includes looking for citations related to the MiniGrid environment and any other datasets referenced in the context of ToM evaluation.

From my reading, I identify the following datasets:

1. **MiniGrid**: A minimalistic grid-world environment used for evaluating ToM tasks in LLMs. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Chevalier-Boisvert, M., Willems, L., & Pal, S. (2018). Minimalistic gridworld environment for gymnasium.

2. **ATOMS Framework**: While not a dataset per se, the authors reference the Abilities in Theory of Mind Space (ATOMS) framework, which categorizes mental states relevant to ToM. The citation for this framework is:
   > Beaudoin, C., Leblanc, Ã‰., Gagner, C., & Beauchamp, M. H. (2020). Systematic review and inventory of theory of mind measures for young children. Frontiers in Psychology, 10, 2905.

3. **Various benchmarks**: The paper discusses several benchmarks for evaluating ToM, including SOCIALIQA, TOMI, and others. I will need to look up the specific citations for these benchmarks in the references section.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I accurately capture all relevant datasets and their citations from the paper.
