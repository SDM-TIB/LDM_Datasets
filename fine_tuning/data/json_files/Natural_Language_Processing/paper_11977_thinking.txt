To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Text-Guided Synthesis of Eulerian Cinemagraphs" by Aniruddha Mahapatra et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions leveraging existing natural image and video datasets, which indicates that datasets are involved, but I need to find specific names and details.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe their dataset usage. Here, they mention two distinct domains for their dataset:

1. **Real Domain**: This dataset is used for training their optical flow prediction and animation models. It consists of real-life videos of scenes like waterfalls, lakes, rivers, and oceans. The authors specify that the training set contains 4,750 videos, while the test set contains 162 videos, with each video consisting of 60 frames at a resolution of 720 × 1280. They also mention that the ground-truth average optical flow is calculated for each video.

2. **Artistic Domain**: Since there is no existing dataset for text-to-cinemagraph, the authors generated 102 artistic images based on 20 different captions corresponding to various fluid elements (like waterfalls and rivers) using different artistic styles.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned:

- For the **Real Domain dataset**, the authors reference the work by Holynski et al. (2021), which is:
  > Aleksander Holynski, Brian L Curless, Steven M Seitz, and Richard Szeliski. *Animating pictures with Eulerian motion fields*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 5810–5819, 2021.

- The **Artistic Domain dataset** is generated by the authors themselves and does not have a formal citation since it is not based on an existing dataset.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for the datasets as required. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
