To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Robustness of Decentralised Learning to Nodes and Data Disruption" by Luigi Palmieri et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental settings sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, and the introduction typically outlines the context and significance of the study, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will pay close attention to **section 4 (Experimental settings)**, as this section often contains detailed descriptions of the datasets used in experiments. In this paper, the authors mention using the **MNIST dataset** for their experiments, which is a well-known dataset for image classification tasks.

I will then look for any additional datasets mentioned in the **results or discussion sections** to ensure I capture all relevant datasets. If the authors refer to any other datasets or provide specific configurations or subsets of datasets, I will note those as well.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. For the MNIST dataset, the citation is:
> Yann LeCun. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998. Available at: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

Since the MNIST dataset is the primary dataset mentioned in the paper, I will ensure to document it thoroughly.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including the dataset name, description, and full citation, into a structured format for clarity and future reference. This will ensure that the datasets are accurately represented and easily accessible for anyone reviewing the research.
