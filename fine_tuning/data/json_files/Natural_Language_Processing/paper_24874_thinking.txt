To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Occupancy as Set of Points" by Yiang Shi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions experiments on the **Occ3D-nuScenes occupancy benchmark**, which indicates that this is a dataset used in their research.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. In section 5.1, the authors explicitly state that they performed experiments on the **nuScenes Dataset** with annotations provided by **Occ3D**. This confirms that both datasets are utilized in their work.

I will also check the **related work section** to see if there are any other datasets referenced that may be relevant to their methodology or comparisons. However, the focus here is primarily on the **nuScenes Dataset** and the **Occ3D** benchmark.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to gather the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **nuScenes Dataset**, the citation is:
   > Caesar, H., Bankiti, V., Lang, A.H., Vora, S., Liong, V.E., Xu, Q., Krishnan, A., Pan, Y., Baldan, G., Beijbom, O. (2020). *nuscenes: A multimodal dataset for autonomous driving*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF conference on computer vision and pattern recognition (CVPR), pp. 11621â€“11631.

2. For the **Occ3D** benchmark, the citation is:
   > Tian, X., Jiang, T., Yun, L., Mao, Y., Yang, H., Wang, Y., Wang, Y., Zhao, H. (2023). *Occ3d: A large-scale 3d occupancy prediction benchmark for autonomous driving*. 

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets:

- **nuScenes Dataset**: A multimodal dataset designed for autonomous driving, providing a comprehensive set of data for various tasks including 3D occupancy prediction.
- **Occ3D**: A benchmark specifically for 3D occupancy prediction, which includes annotations and ground truth for evaluating occupancy prediction methods.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that each dataset is clearly identified along with its full citation.
