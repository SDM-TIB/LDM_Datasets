To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards End-to-end Speech-to-text Summarization" by Raul Monteiro and Diogo Pernes, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and dataset sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, while the introduction may contain references to specific datasets used in the experiments.

In **section 3 (Dataset)**, the authors describe the dataset they built for S2T abstractive summarization of broadcast news in French. They mention that the dataset was constructed from articles available on the EuroNews website. The dataset is named **BNews** and consists of audio, an abstractive summary, and the article body for each news article. The authors detail the process of selecting articles based on the accuracy of transcripts generated by an ASR model, and they provide the sizes of the train, dev, and test splits.

Next, I will ensure to note the specific details about the BNews dataset:
- **BNews Dataset**: Contains audio, abstractive summaries, and article bodies from EuroNews. The dataset was filtered based on a word error rate (WER) threshold of 45%. The final splits consist of 13,380 for training, 1,672 for validation, and 1,673 for testing.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the BNews dataset. However, since the dataset is newly created by the authors and does not have a separate publication, I will note that it is referenced in the paper itself.

The citation for the dataset will be:
> Monteiro, R., & Pernes, D. (2023). Towards End-to-end Speech-to-text Summarization. In Proceedings of the [Conference Name], [Page Numbers]. [Publisher]. [DOI or URL if available].

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format, ensuring that the full citation is included for the BNews dataset. This will allow for proper attribution and reference in any future work or analysis.
