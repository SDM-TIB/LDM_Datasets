To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Zero-shot Compound Expression Recognition with Visual Language Model at the 6th ABAW Challenge" by Jiahe Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors utilized datasets from the 6th Workshop and Competition on Affective Behavior Analysis in-the-wild (ABAW), which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors discuss the challenges in recognizing compound expressions and mention the C-EXPR-DB database. This is a strong indication that this dataset is central to their research.

In the **method section**, particularly under **Data Process**, the authors describe their use of the C-EXPR-DB, which consists of 400 videos and approximately 200K frames annotated with respect to 12 compound expressions. They also specify that for their challenge, they only considered seven compound expressions. This confirms the dataset's relevance and details.

Moving to the **experiments section**, the authors mention using two databases: **C-EXPR-DB** and **RAF-DB**. The RAF-DB is described as a comprehensive facial expression database with around 30,000 images, which is also crucial for their experiments.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset from the **References section**:

1. **C-EXPR-DB**:
   > Dimitrios Kollias. *Multi-label compound expression recognition: C-expr database & network*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 5589–5598, 2023.

2. **RAF-DB**:
   > Shan Li and Weihong Deng. *Reliable crowdsourcing and deep locality-preserving learning for unconstrained facial expression recognition*. IEEE Transactions on Image Processing, 28(1):356–370, 2019.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets:

- **C-EXPR-DB**: An audiovisual database comprising 400 videos and approximately 200K frames, annotated for 12 compound expressions, with seven specific expressions used in the challenge.
- **RAF-DB**: A facial expression database containing around 30,000 images, labeled by multiple annotators, with a focus on both basic and compound emotions.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that each dataset is clearly identified with its citation.
