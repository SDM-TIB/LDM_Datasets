To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Gradient Shaping for Multi-Constraint Safe Reinforcement Learning" by Yihang Yao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, but it may not explicitly mention datasets. The introduction often discusses related work and may reference datasets used in prior studies.

Next, I will pay close attention to **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe their experimental setup. This section typically includes details about the datasets or environments used for testing the proposed methods. In this case, the authors mention using the **Bullet-Safety-Gym** and **Safety-Gymnasium** environments, which are crucial for understanding the context of their experiments.

I will also look for any specific datasets or benchmarks that are cited in the experiments. The authors refer to tasks and constraints in their experiments, which may imply the use of specific datasets. 

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. This is essential for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets themselves.

From the paper, I can identify the following datasets:

1. **Bullet-Safety-Gym**: This is a framework for constrained reinforcement learning, and the citation is:
   > Gronauer, S. *Bullet-Safety-Gym: A framework for constrained reinforcement learning*. 2022.

2. **Safety-Gymnasium**: This is another framework used in the experiments, and the citation is:
   > Ji, J., Zhang, B., Pan, X., Zhou, J., Dai, J., & Yang, Y. *Safety-gymnasium*. GitHub repository, 2023.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their proper citations.
