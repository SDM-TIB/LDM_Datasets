To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Using Soft-Prompt Tuning to Evaluate Bias in Large Language Models" by Jacob-Junqi Tian et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are mentioned or implied. The abstract discusses the use of soft-prompt tuning for evaluating biases in large language models (LLMs) and hints at the datasets used for sentiment analysis tasks.

Next, I will examine the **methodology** section, where the authors describe their experimental setup. Here, they mention using two specific datasets for prompt tuning: 

1. **SemEval-2018 Task 1-Valence Ordinal Classification**: This dataset consists of English tweets labeled with sentiment scores ranging from -3 to 3, which are then mapped to a three-way classification task (negative, neutral, positive).

2. **Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST-5)**: This dataset includes movie reviews annotated with five sentiment labels (very positive, positive, neutral, negative, very negative), which are also condensed into a three-way classification.

In the **results** section, the authors analyze the performance of their models on these datasets, confirming their use in the experiments. 

Now, I will look at the **References section** to gather the full citations for these datasets:

- For **SemEval-2018 Task 1**, the citation is:
  > Saif, M., Bravo-Marquez, F., Salameh, M., & Kiritchenko, S. (2018). SemEval-2018 Task 1: Affect in Tweets. In Proceedings of International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval-2018). New Orleans, LA, USA.

- For **Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST-5)**, the citation is:
  > Socher, R., Perelygin, A., Wu, J., Chuang, J., Manning, C., Ng, A., & Potts, C. (2013). Recursive Deep Models for Semantic Compositionality Over a Sentiment Treebank. In Proceedings of the 2013 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, 1631â€“1642. Seattle, Washington, USA: Association for Computational Linguistics.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This structured approach will help in accurately documenting the datasets used in the research paper for future reference or analysis.
