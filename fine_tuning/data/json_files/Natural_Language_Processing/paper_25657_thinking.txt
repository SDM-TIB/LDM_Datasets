To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On ADMM in Heterogeneous Federated Learning: Personalization, Robustness, and Fairness" by Shengkun Zhu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

1. **Read the Abstract and Introduction**: I will start by examining the abstract and introduction sections for any mentions of datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may highlight key datasets used in the experiments.

2. **Identify Sections on Experiments and Datasets**: Next, I will look for sections specifically dedicated to experiments or datasets. In this paper, I will focus on sections that discuss the experimental setup, as they typically contain detailed information about the datasets used.

3. **Locate Dataset Descriptions**: In the relevant sections, I will look for explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, characteristics (such as the number of samples and classes), and any specific configurations or partitions used in the experiments.

4. **Extract Dataset Information**: For each identified dataset, I will extract the following information:
   - **Name of the Dataset**: The official name as mentioned in the paper.
   - **Description**: A brief description of the dataset, including its purpose and any relevant details (e.g., number of samples, classes).
   - **Citation**: I will check the references section of the paper to find the full citation for each dataset. This may involve looking up the original papers or sources from which the datasets were derived.

5. **Compile the Information**: After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile it into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset entry includes the name, description, and citation.

6. **Review for Completeness**: Finally, I will review the extracted information to ensure that all datasets mentioned in the paper are accounted for and that the citations are accurate and complete.

By following these steps, I will be able to systematically extract and document the datasets used in the research paper, ensuring that I provide full citations for each dataset as required.
