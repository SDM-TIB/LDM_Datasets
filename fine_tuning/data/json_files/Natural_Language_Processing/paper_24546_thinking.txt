To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Sanskrit Knowledge-based Systems: Annotation and Computational Tools" by Hrishikesh Rajesh Terdalkar, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the research focus and any datasets that may be mentioned. The abstract highlights the construction of knowledge-based systems and the challenges related to the scarcity of appropriate datasets, which suggests that datasets are indeed a key component of the research.

Next, I will look into **section 2 (Sanskrit Question Answering Framework)**, particularly focusing on the **experiments and results** subsection. Here, the author discusses the datasets used for constructing knowledge graphs and evaluating the question-answering system. I will specifically note any datasets mentioned, including their names and descriptions.

In **section 2.6.1 (Datasets)**, the author explicitly mentions two types of datasets:

1. **Human Relationships**: The datasets derived from the two well-known epics, **Rāmāyaṇa** and **Mahābhārata**, which contain numerous characters and their relationships. This indicates that these texts serve as datasets for human relationships.

2. **Synonymous Relationships of Substances**: The **Bhāvaprakāśanighaṇṭu**, a glossary chapter from the Āyurveda text **Bhāvaprakāśa**, is identified as the dataset for synonymous relationships, detailing various medicinal plants and substances.

Next, I will check the **statistics section** (Table 2.3) to gather quantitative details about these datasets, such as the number of chapters, documents, and unique words.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for the datasets used in the research.

The citations I will look for include:

- For **Rāmāyaṇa** and **Mahābhārata**, I will reference the original texts or any authoritative editions.
- For **Bhāvaprakāśanighaṇṭu**, I will find the citation for the original text by Bhāvamiśra.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including their descriptions and citations, into a structured format for clarity and ease of use.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets referenced in the research paper, maintaining a focus on the importance of proper citation.
