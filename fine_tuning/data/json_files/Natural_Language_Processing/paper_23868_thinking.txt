To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Watching Swarm Dynamics from Above: A Framework for Advanced Object Tracking in Drone Videos" by Duc Pham et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of drone videos for tracking animal behavior, which suggests that there may be datasets related to this research.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors describe their methodology and the data they collected. In this section, they mention that they recorded data with a DJI Phantom 4 drone, capturing videos of predator-prey interactions in the Pacific Ocean. They specify that the dataset includes 40 minutes of video data, consisting of 8 videos of 5 minutes each, which is crucial information.

I will also look for any specific details about the dataset, such as the number of annotated frames, the types of annotations provided (e.g., pixel-accurate segmentation masks), and how the data is structured. The authors mention that each video is accompanied by synchronized sensor measurements from the drone, which adds value to the dataset.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets or related works mentioned. The authors indicate that they will release the new dataset for tracking collective animal behavior along with an extended version of the paper, which implies that the dataset is original and not previously published.

The key dataset extracted from the paper is:

1. **Dataset for Tracking Collective Animal Behavior**: This dataset includes videos of schooling prey during group hunts of striped marlins, with annotations for tracking the dynamics of the fish school. The dataset consists of 40 minutes of video data, with 8 videos of 5 minutes each, and includes pixel-accurate segmentation masks for 800 frames.

Since this dataset is newly introduced in the paper, it does not have a separate citation in the references. However, I will note that the authors plan to make it available for further analysis and research purposes.

Now, I will compile the information about the dataset, including its description and any relevant details, ensuring to highlight that it is a new dataset introduced by the authors.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entry for review or further processing.
