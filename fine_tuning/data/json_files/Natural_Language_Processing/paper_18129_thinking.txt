To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Intelligent Condition Monitoring of Industrial Plants: An Overview of Methodologies and Uncertainty Management Strategies" by Maryam Ahang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract highlights the focus on the **Tennessee Eastman Process (TEP)** as a benchmark for evaluating methodologies, indicating that this is a key dataset.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **methodology section**. The authors describe the TEP as a realistic simulation of an industrial chemical plant and mention that it is widely used for process control and monitoring studies. This confirms that the TEP is indeed the primary dataset referenced in the paper.

In the **experiments or results sections**, I will check for any additional datasets or variations of the TEP that might be used in the experiments. However, the focus remains on the TEP throughout the paper, with various methodologies applied to this dataset.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citation for the Tennessee Eastman Process dataset. The original paper describing the TEP is:

- For the **Tennessee Eastman Process**, the citation is:
  > Downs, J. J., & Vogel, E. F. (1993). A plant-wide industrial process control problem. *Computers & Chemical Engineering*, 17(3), 245-255.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the dataset details, ensuring to include the full citation as required. The TEP is a comprehensive dataset that includes various process variables and is essential for benchmarking condition monitoring methodologies.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format for further processing or review.
