To extract datasets from the research paper titled "LoRA-GA: Low-Rank Adaptation with Gradient Approximation" by Shaowen Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they mention evaluating their method on various benchmark datasets. Specifically, they refer to:

1. **GLUE Dataset**: A well-known benchmark for evaluating natural language understanding models. The authors mention using a subset of this dataset with the T5-Base model.

2. **MT-Bench Dataset**: This dataset is used to evaluate the chat capabilities of their model, specifically designed for multi-turn questions.

3. **MetaMathQA Dataset**: This dataset is utilized for evaluating mathematical reasoning capabilities, bootstrapped from other instruction tuning datasets.

4. **GSM8K Dataset**: A dataset for mathematical problem-solving, which is also mentioned in the context of evaluating their model's performance.

5. **HumanEval Dataset**: This dataset consists of Python programming tasks and is used to assess the coding abilities of the model.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For the **GLUE Dataset**, the citation is:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented and properly cited.
