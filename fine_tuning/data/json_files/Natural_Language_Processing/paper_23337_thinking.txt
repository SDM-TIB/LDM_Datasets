To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Meta-Learners for Partially-Identified Treatment Effects Across Multiple Environments" by Jonas Schweisthal et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of observational data from multiple environments, which suggests that there may be specific datasets referenced later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. I will look for any specific names or descriptions of datasets, particularly in the context of the experiments conducted with synthetic and real-world data.

In the **experiments section**, the authors mention two types of datasets:
1. **Synthetic Data 1**: This dataset is generated based on a specific data-generating process involving observed and unobserved confounders. However, it does not have a formal citation since it is synthetic.
2. **Synthetic Data 2**: Similar to Synthetic Data 1, this dataset is also generated synthetically and does not have a formal citation.

Additionally, the authors reference a **real-world dataset** concerning COVID-19 hospitalizations in Brazil, which is used to demonstrate the applicability of their meta-learners. The citation for this dataset is:
- Baqui, P., Bica, I., Marra, V., Ercole, A., and van Der Schaar, M. "Ethnic and regional variations in hospital mortality from COVID-19 in Brazil: a cross-sectional observational study." *The Lancet Global Health*, 8(8): e1018–e1026, 2020.

Now, I will compile the information about the datasets into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citations for any datasets that require them. Since the synthetic datasets do not have formal citations, I will note that they are generated for the purposes of the study.

In summary, I will document the following datasets:
1. **Synthetic Data 1**: Generated dataset for experimental purposes (no citation).
2. **Synthetic Data 2**: Generated dataset for experimental purposes (no citation).
3. **COVID-19 Hospitalization Dataset**: 
   > Baqui, P., Bica, I., Marra, V., Ercole, A., and van Der Schaar, M. "Ethnic and regional variations in hospital mortality from COVID-19 in Brazil: a cross-sectional observational study." *The Lancet Global Health*, 8(8): e1018–e1026, 2020.

After this, I will prepare the dataset entries for any required structured output or documentation.
