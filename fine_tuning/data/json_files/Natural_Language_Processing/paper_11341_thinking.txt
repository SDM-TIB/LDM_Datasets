To extract datasets from the research paper titled "PUSH: Concurrent Probabilistic Programming for Bayesian Deep Learning" by Daniel Huang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the library and its capabilities but does not mention specific datasets. Therefore, I will move on to the introduction.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of Bayesian deep learning and the need for efficient tools but do not specify any datasets. Next, I will check the **experiments section** where datasets are likely to be mentioned, especially in the context of evaluating the performance of the Push library.

Upon reviewing the **experiments section**, I find that the authors mention using several architectures and tasks, including the **MNIST dataset** for image classification. This is a well-known dataset used for benchmarking machine learning algorithms.

Next, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the MNIST dataset. The citation for the MNIST dataset is as follows:
> Yann LeCun. *The MNIST database of handwritten digits*. 1998. URL: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/.

Additionally, the authors mention using the **MD17 dataset** for regression tasks with the CGCNN architecture. I will also look for the citation for this dataset in the references.

The citation for the MD17 dataset is:
> Stefan Chmiela, Alexandre Tkatchenko, Huziel E Sauceda, Igor Poltavsky, Kristof T Schütt, and Klaus-Robert Müller. *Machine learning of accurate energy-conserving molecular force fields*. Science advances, 3(5):e1603015, 2017.

Lastly, I will check if there are any other datasets mentioned in the paper. The authors refer to the **Advection dataset** for the Unet architecture, which is also used in their experiments. I will find the citation for this dataset as well.

The citation for the Advection dataset is:
> Makoto Takamoto, Timothy Praditia, Raphael Leiteritz, Dan MacKinlay, Francesco Alesiani, Dirk Pflüger, and Mathias Niepert. *PDEBench: An extensive benchmark for scientific machine learning*. 2023.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use.

1. **MNIST Dataset**:
   - Citation: Yann LeCun. *The MNIST database of handwritten digits*. 1998. URL: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/.

2. **MD17 Dataset**:
   - Citation: Stefan Chmiela, Alexandre Tkatchenko, Huziel E Sauceda, Igor Poltavsky, Kristof T Schütt, and Klaus-Robert Müller. *Machine learning of accurate energy-conserving molecular force fields*. Science advances, 3(5):e1603015, 2017.

3. **Advection Dataset**:
   - Citation: Makoto Takamoto, Timothy Praditia, Raphael Leiteritz, Dan MacKinlay, Francesco Alesiani, Dirk Pflüger, and Mathias Niepert. *PDEBench: An extensive benchmark for scientific machine learning*. 2023.

With this information, I am ready to create structured entries for each dataset as needed.
