To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Quantifying Human Priors over Social and Navigation Networks" by Gecia Bravo-Hermsdorff et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the experiments focusing on social interaction and spatial navigation, which suggests that datasets related to these domains may be present.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **methods and experimental design sections**. I will pay close attention to any tables or figures that might summarize the datasets used in the experiments. For instance, if the authors describe the experimental setup involving participants and the types of networks they were asked to infer, this could indicate the datasets utilized.

In the **results section**, I will check for any references to datasets used to validate the findings. The authors may discuss the performance of their models on specific datasets, which would be crucial for my extraction.

I will also review the **appendices** for any supplementary information that might include additional datasets or details about the data collection process. This is often where authors provide more granular details about their experiments.

Once I identify the datasets, I will ensure to extract the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the **references section** of the paper. This is critical as it provides the necessary context and acknowledgment for the datasets used in the research.

For example, if the paper mentions datasets like "Penn Action Dataset" or "sub-JHMDB Dataset," I will look up their full citations in the references to ensure they are correctly attributed.

Finally, I will compile the extracted datasets along with their citations in a clear and organized manner, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its corresponding citation.

By following these steps, I will ensure a thorough and accurate extraction of datasets from the paper.
