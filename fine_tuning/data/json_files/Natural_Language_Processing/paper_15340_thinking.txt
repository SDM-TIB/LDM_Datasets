To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Nighttime Driver Behavior Prediction Using Taillight Signal Recognition via CNN-SVM Classifier" by Amir Hossein Barshooi and Elmira Bagheri, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and dataset sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that a large-scale dataset was collected from dash-cams and Insta360 cameras, which suggests that there is a dataset relevant to the study.

Next, I will focus on **section III (Introducing Dataset)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset. They mention that the dataset includes a total of **110 videos and 3800 images** collected from the rear angles of vehicles, with specific annotations for taillights and brake lights. This section is crucial as it provides the necessary details about the dataset's composition and purpose.

In this section, the authors also describe the conditions under which the data was collected, including various lighting conditions and the types of cameras used. This information is essential for understanding the dataset's context and applicability.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The authors do not provide a specific citation for the dataset they collected, but they reference other works that may be relevant. I will note that the dataset is unique and does not have a direct counterpart in the literature, which is an important point to highlight.

The authors also mention that the dataset includes vehicles from Ford Motor Company, which adds to its significance. However, since there is no formal citation provided for the dataset itself, I will summarize the dataset's details without a formal reference.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format that highlights the dataset's key attributes, including its name, description, and any relevant details about its collection and use.

In summary, the dataset extracted from the paper is as follows:

- **Dataset Name**: Ford Motor Company Taillight Dataset
- **Description**: A dataset containing 110 videos and 3800 images of vehicles captured from the rear angles, annotated for taillights and brake lights, collected under various lighting conditions using dash-cams and Insta360 cameras.

Since there is no formal citation for this dataset, I will note that it is a unique dataset created by the authors for their research.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare it for further processing or review.
