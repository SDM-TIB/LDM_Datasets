To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Panel Data Nowcasting: The Case of Price-Earnings Ratios" by Andrii Babii et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of panel data for nowcasting corporate earnings, which suggests that there may be specific datasets related to corporate earnings and financial indicators.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section. Here, the authors elaborate on the context of their research, mentioning the use of various predictors sampled at different frequencies. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or sources of data.

I will then focus on **section 4.1 (Data description)**, as this section is likely to provide detailed information about the datasets used in the empirical analysis. The authors describe the full sample, which consists of observations from January 1, 2000, to June 30, 2017, and mention the sources of their data, including CRSP, I/B/E/S, and RavenPack. 

In this section, I will identify the specific datasets mentioned:
1. **Price/Earnings Ratio Dataset**: This dataset is derived from CRSP and I/B/E/S, containing quarterly P/E ratios for firms.
2. **Stock Returns Dataset**: Also sourced from CRSP, this dataset includes daily stock returns.
3. **Textual Analysis Data**: This dataset is obtained from RavenPack, which includes daily firm-level news data and sentiment scores.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The citations will provide the necessary details for each dataset, including authors, titles, publication sources, and years.

For the datasets identified, I will compile the following citations:
- For the **Price/Earnings Ratio Dataset**:
  > CRSP and I/B/E/S data sources for quarterly P/E ratios.
  
- For the **Stock Returns Dataset**:
  > CRSP data source for daily stock returns.

- For the **Textual Analysis Data**:
  > Bybee, L., Kelly, B. T., Manela, A., & Xiu, D. (2021). *Business News and Business Cycles*. Available at SSRN 3446225.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets in a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, facilitating further analysis or replication of the study.
