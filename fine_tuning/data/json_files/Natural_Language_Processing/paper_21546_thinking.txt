To extract datasets from the research paper titled "COMPASS: LARGE MULTILINGUAL LANGUAGE MODEL FOR SOUTH-EAST ASIA" by Sophia Maria, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive data mining and purification efforts for low-resource languages, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **data section (2.1)**, where the authors describe their multilingual pre-training dataset. They mention that they curated a dataset comprising **1.7 trillion tokens** from various sources, including CommonCrawl, C4, Wikipedia, WebText, Academic, Books, and Code. This indicates that multiple datasets were utilized in the training process.

In **section 2.1.1 (Tokenization)**, the authors discuss the tokenization process and the vocabulary construction, but they do not introduce new datasets here. I will continue to check the **experiments section (2.4)**, where they evaluate their model against various benchmarks.

In **section 2.4.1 (Experiment Method)**, the authors mention several benchmark datasets used for evaluation, including:

1. **MMLU**: A benchmark for measuring massive multitask language understanding.
2. **IndoMMLU**: A benchmark specifically for Indonesian language understanding.
3. **XCOPA**: A multilingual dataset for causal commonsense reasoning.
4. **GSM8K**: A dataset of diverse grade school math word problems.
5. **HellaSwag**: A dataset for commonsense inference questions.
6. **OpenBookQA**: A dataset for question answering that requires understanding of core science facts.
7. **TruthfulQA**: A benchmark to measure the truthfulness of model responses.

I will now gather the full citations for these datasets from the **References section** of the paper.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
