To extract datasets from the research paper titled "No-Regret Algorithms in non-Truthful Auctions with Budget and ROI Constraints" by Gagan Aggarwal et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

1. **Read the Abstract and Introduction**: I will start by examining the abstract and introduction sections, as they often provide a summary of the key contributions and may mention any datasets used in the research. In this case, the abstract discusses the design of online autobidding algorithms, but does not explicitly mention any datasets.

2. **Identify Relevant Sections**: Next, I will look for sections that typically contain information about datasets, such as "Datasets," "Experiments," or "Methodology." In this paper, I will specifically look for sections that describe the experiments conducted, as they often detail the datasets used.

3. **Locate Dataset Descriptions**: I will carefully read through the relevant sections to find explicit mentions of datasets. If the authors describe any datasets used for experiments, I will note their names, characteristics, and any relevant details provided.

4. **Check the References**: After identifying the datasets, I will check the references section to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

5. **Document Each Dataset**: For each dataset identified, I will document the following:
   - **Name of the Dataset**: The official name as mentioned in the paper.
   - **Description**: A brief description of the dataset, including its purpose and any relevant characteristics (e.g., size, type of data).
   - **Full Citation**: The complete citation for the dataset, as found in the references section of the paper.

6. **Compile the Information**: Finally, I will compile all the information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly presented with its name, description, and citation.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets referenced in the paper, providing a comprehensive overview for future reference or analysis.
