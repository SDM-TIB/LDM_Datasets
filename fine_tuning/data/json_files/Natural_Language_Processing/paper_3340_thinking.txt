To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multilingual Code-Switching for Zero-Shot Cross-Lingual Intent Prediction and Slot Filling" by Jitin Krishnan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that experiments were conducted on the **MultiATIS++** benchmark dataset and a new dataset of tweets for crisis informatics. This suggests that at least two datasets are involved.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for further details about these datasets. The introduction discusses the importance of intent prediction and slot filling, but it primarily references the **MultiATIS++** dataset and the new dataset without providing specific details.

I will then focus on the **Datasets section (Section 4)**, which is likely to contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the experiments. Here, I find:

1. **MultiATIS++ Dataset**: This dataset was created by translating the original ATIS dataset into multiple languages (Spanish, Portuguese, German, French, Chinese, Japanese, Hindi, and Turkish). It includes utterances with intent labels for flight intent and slot labels in BIO format.

2. **Disaster Tweets Dataset**: This is a new dataset created for intent prediction and slot filling in English and Haitian Creole, collected during the Haiti earthquake disaster. It includes tweets annotated for intents such as 'request' and 'others', and slot labels like 'medical_help', 'food', 'water', 'shelter', and 'other_aid'.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution:

- For the **MultiATIS++ Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Weijia Xu, Batool Haider, and Saab Mansour. *End-to-end slot alignment and recognition for cross-lingual nlu*. In Proceedings of the 2020 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), pages 5052â€“5063, 2020.

- For the **Disaster Tweets Dataset**, since it is a new dataset created by the authors, I will cite it as follows:
  > Jitin Krishnan, Hemant Purohit, and Huzefa Rangwala. *New human-annotated tweet dataset for intent prediction and slot filling in English and Haitian Creole*. Collected during the Haiti earthquake disaster, 2023.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
