To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Uncertainty-Driven Multi-Scale Feature Fusion Network for Real-time Image Deraining" by Ming Tong et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the datasets used. The experimental section typically contains detailed information about the datasets employed in the study.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges posed by rain streaks in images and the need for effective deraining methods. However, they do not explicitly mention any datasets at this point.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental section**, particularly the part where the authors describe their experimental setup and the datasets used. In this paper, the authors mention several datasets in **Table I**, which lists the datasets utilized for their experiments. The datasets are:

1. **Rain100L**: This dataset consists of 1800 training images and 100 test images, specifically designed for synthetic rain removal tasks.
2. **Rain100H**: Similar to Rain100L, this dataset also contains 1800 training images and 100 test images, but it is tailored for high-density rain scenarios.
3. **Rain800**: This dataset includes 800 training images and 100 test images, focusing on various rain conditions.
4. **Rain1400**: This dataset comprises 12600 training images and 1400 test images, providing a broader range of rain conditions for evaluation.

The authors also reference a real-world dataset proposed by Fu et al. for comparison, but they do not provide specific details about it in the table.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **Rain100L** and **Rain100H**, the citation is:
  > Xueyang Fu, Jiabin Huang, Delu Zeng, Yue Huang, Xinghao Ding, and John Paisley. *Removing rain from single images via a deep detail network*. In Proceedings of the IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pages 3855–3863, 2017.

- For **Rain800**, the citation is:
  > He Zhang, Vishwanath Sindagi, and Vishal M Patel. *Image de-raining using a conditional generative adversarial network*. IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology, 30(11):3943–3956, 2019.

- For **Rain1400**, the citation is:
  > Xueyang Fu, Borong Liang, Yue Huang, Xinghao Ding, and John Paisley. *Lightweight pyramid networks for image deraining*. IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems, 31(6):1794–1807, 2019.

With this information, I can now summarize the datasets and their citations accurately.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
