To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Set Neural Networks for forecasting asynchronous bioprocess timeseries" by Maxim Borisyak et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and numerical experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of Deep Set Neural Networks for forecasting tasks, but does not specify any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Numerical experiments)**, where the authors describe their evaluation methodology. They mention simulating data from two mechanistic models: **Michaelis–Menten kinetics (MMK)** and **E. coli growth model**. This indicates that the datasets used for their experiments are generated from these models, but I need to confirm if they are publicly available datasets or if they are synthetic datasets created for the purpose of this study.

I will also check the **Acknowledgements and References sections** to see if there are any mentions of datasets or prior works that provide datasets. The references include works by Anane et al. (2017) and others, but they do not explicitly mention datasets used in this paper.

Since the authors generated their own datasets from the mechanistic models, I will note that these datasets are not publicly available but are based on the described models. Therefore, I will not be able to provide full citations for datasets in the traditional sense, as they are not sourced from external repositories.

In summary, the datasets referenced in this paper are:

1. **Synthetic dataset from Michaelis–Menten kinetics (MMK)**: This dataset is generated from the MMK model for the purpose of the experiments.
2. **Synthetic dataset from E. coli growth model**: This dataset is generated from the E. coli growth model by Anane et al. (2017) for the experiments.

Since these datasets are synthetic and not publicly available, I will note that they are based on the respective mechanistic models rather than providing full citations as would be done for publicly available datasets.

Now, I will compile the information regarding these datasets, noting their synthetic nature and the models they are based on, ready for further processing or documentation.
