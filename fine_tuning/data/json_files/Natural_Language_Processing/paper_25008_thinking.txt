To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MemoCRS: Memory-enhanced Sequential Conversational Recommender Systems with Large Language Models" by Yunjia Xi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract states that extensive experiments were conducted on both Chinese and English datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 5) where the authors discuss the datasets used for their experiments. In **Section 5.1.1**, the authors explicitly mention two datasets:

1. **TGReDial**: This dataset is described as a collection of Chinese conversational recommendation sessions, containing 10,000 sessions of 129,392 utterances involving 1,482 users and 33,834 movies.

2. **ReDial**: This dataset is an English conversational recommendation dataset built manually through crowd-sourcing, including 10,006 dialogues of 182,150 utterances related to 51,699 movies and 504 users.

Both datasets are crucial for the experiments conducted in the paper, and I will ensure to note their significance in the context of the research.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **TGReDial**, the citation is:
  > Kun Zhou, Yuanhang Zhou, Wayne Xin Zhao, Xiaoke Wang, and Ji-Rong Wen. *Towards Topic-Guided Conversational Recommender System*. In Proceedings of the 28th International Conference on Computational Linguistics, COLING 2020, Barcelona, Spain, December 8-11, 2020.

- For **ReDial**, the citation is:
  > Raymond Li, Samira Ebrahimi Kahou, Hannes Schulz, Vincent Michalski, Laurent Charlin, and Chris Pal. *Towards Deep Conversational Recommendations*. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 31 (NIPS 2018).

With this information, I can now summarize the datasets and their citations clearly.

In conclusion, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and accompanied by its full citation, ready for further processing or review.
