To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards true discovery of the differential equations" by Alexander Hvatov and Roman Titov, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections for any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the use of "data" in the context of differential equation discovery, but it does not specify any datasets. The introduction discusses various methods and frameworks but does not explicitly name any datasets either.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **experiments**. In this paper, the authors refer to the **Lynx-Hare dataset** in the **experimental study** section. This dataset is crucial as it is used to illustrate the proposed approach for discovering the Lotka-Volterra model.

I will extract the relevant details about the Lynx-Hare dataset:
- The dataset is openly available and can be found at the provided GitHub link.
- It is used in the context of the Lotka-Volterra model, which is a well-known ecological model.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Lynx-Hare dataset. The paper cites the dataset as follows:
> Langton, H. The conservation of the wild life of Canada, 1921.

This citation provides the necessary information to document the dataset properly.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, ensuring that I include the full citation as required. The dataset entry will focus on the Lynx-Hare dataset, detailing its availability and relevance to the research.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entry for review or further processing.
