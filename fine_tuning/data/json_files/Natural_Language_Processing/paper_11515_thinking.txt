To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Cross-corpus Readability Compatibility Assessment for English Texts" by Zhenzhen Li, Han Ding, and Shaohong Zhang, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and data sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions a novel evaluation framework and lists several corpora, which indicates that datasets are likely included.

Next, I will focus on **section IV (Data and Features)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used in their study. They mention six datasets for readability research:

1. **CEFR**: The Common European Framework of Reference for Languages, which categorizes language proficiency into six levels based on text difficulty.
2. **CLEC**: The Chinese Learner English Corpus, which consists of English writing samples from learners at five different proficiency levels.
3. **CLOTH**: A large-scale English cloze test dataset divided into junior high and senior high school levels.
4. **NES**: The Newsela corpus, which includes news articles suitable for students from 2nd to 12th grade.
5. **OSP**: The OneStopEnglish corpus, which contains texts at three levels of reading difficulty.
6. **RACE**: The Reading Comprehension Dataset from Examinations, which includes materials from English exams for middle and high school students.

In the same section, the authors provide details about the volume and characteristics of each dataset, which will be useful for the description.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and will include the authors, title, publication venue, and year.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, volume, and full citation.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for further processing or review.
