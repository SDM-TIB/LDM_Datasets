To extract datasets from the research paper titled "PixMamba: Leveraging State Space Models in a Dual-Level Architecture for Underwater Image Enhancement" by Wei-Tung Lin et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract highlights that PixMamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across various underwater image datasets, indicating that datasets are indeed involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.2 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they describe two datasets:

1. **UIEB Dataset**: This dataset consists of a total of 950 images, which are divided into a training set of 800 samples (U800), a validation set of 90 samples (T90), and a challenge set of 60 samples (C60). Each sample in U800 and T90 includes a raw degraded underwater image and its corresponding human-curated reference image, while C60 contains only degraded images.

2. **UCCS Dataset**: This dataset includes three different underwater color settings: bluish, greenish, and blue-green tones, with each setting containing 100 images, totaling 300 images.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **UIEB Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Li, C., Guo, C., Ren, W., Cong, R., Hou, J., Kwong, S., & Tao, D. (2020). An underwater image enhancement benchmark dataset and beyond. *IEEE Transactions on Image Processing*, 29, 4376–4389.

- For the **UCCS Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Liu, R., Fan, X., Zhu, M., Hou, M., & Luo, Z. (2020). Real-world underwater enhancement: Challenges, benchmarks, and solutions under natural light. *IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology*, 30(12), 4861–4875.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This includes ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation.
