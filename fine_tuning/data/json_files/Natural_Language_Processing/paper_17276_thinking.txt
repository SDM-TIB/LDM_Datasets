To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Tokenization and Addressing Misgendering in LLMs with Pronoun Tokenization Parity" by Anaelia Ovalle et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the use of a dataset called **Wikibios**, which consists of narratives about real individuals. This indicates that there is at least one dataset that is central to the research.

Next, I will look for specific sections that discuss datasets in detail, particularly the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors describe their methodology and the datasets used for evaluation. I will focus on any sections that explicitly mention datasets, such as **section 5 (Experiments)**.

In section 5, the authors detail their experiments and mention the **Wikibios dataset** as the primary dataset used for fine-tuning their models. They also describe how they augmented this dataset by replacing binary pronouns with neopronouns to address data scarcity. This is crucial information that confirms the dataset's relevance to their experiments.

Additionally, the authors reference the **MISGENDERED dataset** by Hossain et al. (2023) for evaluation purposes. This dataset is used to assess the performance of their models in terms of pronoun consistency and misgendering rates.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper from the **References section**:

1. **Wikibios Dataset**:
   > "Wikibios dataset, which consists of narratives about real individuals." Available at: https://huggingface.co/datasets/wiki_bio.

2. **MISGENDERED Dataset**:
   > Hossain, T., Dev, S., & Singh, S. (2023). *Misgendered: Limits of large language models in understanding pronouns*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2306.03950.

With these citations in hand, I can now summarize the datasets extracted from the paper:

- **Wikibios Dataset**: A dataset containing narratives about real individuals, used for fine-tuning models to improve neopronoun representation.
- **MISGENDERED Dataset**: A dataset used for evaluating the performance of models in terms of pronoun consistency and misgendering.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its citation.
