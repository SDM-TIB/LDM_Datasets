To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Supervised Knowledge Makes Large Language Models Better In-Context Learners" by Linyi Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors provide a comprehensive suite of resources, including "16 curated datasets," which suggests that multiple datasets are involved.

Next, I will look into the **methodology** and **experiments** sections, particularly focusing on any sections that explicitly mention datasets. In the **Experiments** section, the authors discuss their evaluation on various tasks and mention specific datasets used for these tasks.

I will pay close attention to **Table 1**, which lists data statistics for the datasets used in their experiments. The datasets mentioned include:

1. **SST-2**: A sentiment analysis dataset.
2. **MNLI**: A multi-genre natural language inference dataset.
3. **QNLI**: A question-answering dataset derived from the Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD).
4. **RTE**: A dataset for recognizing textual entailment.
5. **MRPC**: A dataset for paraphrase identification.
6. **QQP**: A dataset for question pair similarity.
7. **STS-B**: A dataset for semantic textual similarity.
8. **CoLA**: A dataset for linguistic acceptability.
9. **SQuAD 2.0**: A dataset for question answering that includes unanswerable questions.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. Here are the citations I will extract:

After gathering the dataset names and their corresponding citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference and further processing. This will ensure that all datasets are accurately documented with their full citations, as required.
