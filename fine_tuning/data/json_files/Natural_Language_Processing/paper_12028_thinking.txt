To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Leveraging text data for causal inference using electronic health records" by Reagan Mozer et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's objectives and may hint at the datasets used.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Study Design and Data)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets in detail. In this section, they mention using a subset of data from the **Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-III)** database, which is crucial for my extraction.

I will note the specifics provided about the dataset:
- The sample consists of **2,625 adult patients** admitted with a diagnosis of sepsis in the medical and surgical intensive care units at a university hospital in Boston, Massachusetts, from 2001 to 2012.
- The treatment group includes **1,333 patients** who received transthoracic echocardiography (TTE), while the control group consists of **1,292 patients** who did not receive TTE.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the MIMIC-III database. The citation is:
> Johnson, A. E., Pollard, T. J., Shen, L., Li-wei, H. L., Feng, M., Ghassemi, M., Moody, B., Szolovits, P., Celi, L. A., and Mark, R. G. (2016). *MIMIC-III, a freely accessible critical care database*. Scientific data, 3:160035.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citation for the MIMIC-III database as it is the primary dataset referenced in the study.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that all relevant details are captured accurately.
