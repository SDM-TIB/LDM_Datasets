To extract datasets from the research paper titled "TEDDY: Trimming Edges with Degree-Based Discrimination Strategy" by Hyunjin Seo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the experimental results demonstrate the performance of TEDDY across diverse benchmark datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed used.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section (Section 6)**, where the authors describe their empirical studies. In **Section 6.1 (Small- and Medium-Scale Tasks)**, they explicitly state that they evaluate TEDDY on three benchmark datasets: **Cora**, **Citeseer**, and **Pubmed**. This is a clear identification of datasets used in their experiments.

I will also check the **dataset statistics** provided in **Section B.1** to gather additional details about these datasets, including the number of nodes, edges, classes, and features. This information is crucial for a comprehensive understanding of each dataset.

Now, I will compile the full citations for each dataset from the **References section** of the paper. The citations for the datasets mentioned are as follows:

1. **Cora Dataset**:
   > Sen, P., Namata, G., Bilgic, M., Getoor, L., Galligher, J., & Eliassi-Rad, T. (2008). Collective classification in network data. *AI Magazine*, 29(3), 93-93.

2. **Citeseer Dataset**:
   > Sen, P., Namata, G., Bilgic, M., Getoor, L., Galligher, J., & Eliassi-Rad, T. (2008). Collective classification in network data. *AI Magazine*, 29(3), 93-93.

3. **Pubmed Dataset**:
   > Sen, P., Namata, G., Bilgic, M., Getoor, L., Galligher, J., & Eliassi-Rad, T. (2008). Collective classification in network data. *AI Magazine*, 29(3), 93-93.

4. **Arxiv Dataset**:
   > Hu, W., Fey, M., Zitnik, M., Dong, Y., Ren, H., Liu, B., Catasta, M., & Leskovec, J. (2020). Open graph benchmark: Datasets for machine learning on graphs. *Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems*, 33, 22118-22133.

5. **Reddit Dataset**:
   > Zeng, H., Zhou, H., Srivastava, A., Kannan, R., & Prasanna, V. (2019). Graph-saint: Graph sampling based inductive learning method. *arXiv preprint arXiv:1907.04931*.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets in a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly identified along with its citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
