To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Bi-Directional Semi-Supervised Training of Convolutional Neural Networks for Ultrasound Elastography Displacement Estimation" by Ali K. Z. Tehrani et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of "experimental phantom and in vivo data" for validation, indicating that these are the datasets of interest.

Next, I will look for specific details about these datasets in the **Data Collection section**. Here, the authors describe two datasets:

1. **Experimental Phantom Data**: This dataset is collected using a tissue-mimicking breast phantom made from Zerdine. The phantom contains hard inclusions and is used for training and testing. The authors mention that different parts of the phantom were imaged to avoid data leakage.

2. **In Vivo Data**: This dataset is collected from patients with liver cancer during open-surgical RF thermal ablation at Johns Hopkins Hospital. The authors provide details about the imaging system used and confirm that the institutional review board approved the study with patient consent.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. However, in this case, the datasets are not associated with specific external publications but are described in detail within the paper itself.

Since the datasets are not formally published datasets with citations, I will note them as internal datasets used in the study. The descriptions will include the context of their use, such as the type of data (phantom vs. in vivo) and the purpose (training/testing).

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format, ensuring that I include the necessary details about each dataset, even if they do not have formal citations. This will provide a clear understanding of the datasets used in the research.

In summary, I will extract the following datasets:
- **Experimental Phantom Data**: Description of the phantom and its use in the study.
- **In Vivo Data**: Description of the patient data collected and its context.

After gathering all necessary information, I will prepare the dataset entries for further processing or review.
