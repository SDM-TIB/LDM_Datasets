To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Bilingual alignment transfers to multilingual alignment for unsupervised parallel text mining" by Chih-chan Tien and Shane Steinert-Threlkeld, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors often discuss the context of their work and may reference datasets that are relevant to their research. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or references to prior work that utilized specific datasets.

In the **experiments section**, I will pay close attention to any subsections that detail the datasets used for training and evaluation. This section typically contains the most comprehensive information about the datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access the datasets.

From the paper, I can identify the following datasets:

1. **BUCC Dataset**: This dataset is mentioned in the experiments section as being used for bitext mining tasks. The authors describe it as containing 95k to 460k sentences in multiple languages, with a focus on translation pair mining.

In Proceedings of the Eleventh International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC 2018), Miyazaki, Japan. European Language Resources Association (ELRA).

2. **Tatoeba Dataset**: This dataset is also referenced in the experiments section, where the authors evaluate their models on parallel sentence matching tasks. It consists of English-aligned sentence pairs for various languages.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that all relevant details are captured and properly attributed.
