To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Gaussian Processes for Monitoring Air-Quality in Kampala" by Clara Stoddart et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information and provide full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract highlights the use of data from AirQoâ€™s network of sensors, which suggests that there is a specific dataset being utilized.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Predicting Air Pollution in Kampala)**, where the authors explicitly describe the dataset. They mention using a dataset provided by AirQo, consisting of **66 air-quality sensors deployed around Kampala**, with measurements taken in November 2021. This section provides key details about the dataset, including the nature of the data (hourly readings of PM2.5 levels) and the challenges faced (e.g., extreme values and outliers).

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The authors reference a specific paper that describes the AirQo dataset:

- For the AirQo dataset, the citation is:
  > Richard Sserunjogi, Joel Ssematimba, Deo Okure, Daniel Ogenrwot, Priscilla Adong, Lillian Muyama, Noah Nsimbe, Martin Bbaale, and Engineer Bainomugisha. *Seeing the air in detail: Hyperlocal air quality dataset collected from spatially distributed AirQo network*. Data in brief, 44:108512, October 2022.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the dataset details:

1. **AirQo Dataset**: This dataset consists of measurements from 66 air-quality sensors deployed around Kampala, providing hourly readings of PM2.5 levels for November 2021. The dataset is notable for containing extreme values and outliers, which the authors address in their analysis.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing, ensuring that the full citation is included for the dataset. This will allow for easy reference and validation of the dataset used in the research.
