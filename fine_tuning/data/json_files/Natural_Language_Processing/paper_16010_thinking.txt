To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Safety, Trust, and Ethics Considerations for Human-AI Teaming in Aerospace Control" by Kerianne L. Hobbs and Bernard Li, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections that discuss methodologies or experiments** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a general overview, but specific datasets are often detailed in the methodology or results sections.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to see if the authors mention any datasets or studies that they reference. If they discuss prior work or benchmarks, I will note those as potential datasets.

Then, I will examine the **main body of the paper**, particularly sections that might detail experiments or case studies. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets used in their research. If the authors refer to datasets, I will take note of their names, descriptions, and any relevant details about their structure or content.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for the datasets used in the research.

For example, if the authors reference a dataset like the "Penn Action Dataset," I will ensure to find the complete citation for it, which might look like:
> Wenzheng Zhang, Menglong Zhu, and Konstantinos G. Derpanis. *From Actemes to Action: A Strongly-Supervised Representation for Detailed Action Understanding*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 2248â€“2255, 2013.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will include the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset information in a structured format for easy reference and further processing, ensuring that all entries are clear and complete.
