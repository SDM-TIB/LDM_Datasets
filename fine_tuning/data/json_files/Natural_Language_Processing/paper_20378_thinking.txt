To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Scheduling Drone and Mobile Charger via Hybrid-Action Deep Reinforcement Learning" by Jizhe Dou et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for experiments or evaluations.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** of the paper, as this section typically contains detailed information about the datasets used in the study. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and any specific characteristics that are relevant to the research.

If the paper includes a **datasets section**, I will pay close attention to it, as it is likely to provide comprehensive details about each dataset, including how they were collected, their structure, and their relevance to the study.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial, as proper citation is necessary for academic integrity and allows others to locate the original sources of the datasets.

For each dataset, I will note the following details:
1. **Dataset Name**: The official name of the dataset as mentioned in the paper.
2. **Description**: A brief description of the dataset, including its purpose and any relevant characteristics.
3. **Full Citation**: The complete reference for the dataset, including authors, title, publication venue, and year.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry is clear and includes the full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details and that the information is presented accurately and comprehensively.
