To extract datasets from the research paper titled "One-shot Neural Face Reenactment via Finding Directions in GANâ€™s Latent Space" by Stella Bounareli et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their method on the **VoxCeleb1 and VoxCeleb2 datasets**, which indicates that these are key datasets used in their research.

Next, I will look into the **methodology** and **experiments** sections, particularly focusing on any sections that explicitly discuss datasets. In the **experiments section**, the authors state that they perform qualitative and quantitative comparisons on the **VoxCeleb1** and **VoxCeleb2** datasets. This confirms that these datasets are indeed utilized for their experiments.

I will also check the **related work** and **conclusion** sections to see if there are any additional datasets mentioned or any further details about the datasets used. However, the primary datasets of interest appear to be the VoxCeleb datasets.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the **references section** of the paper:

1. **VoxCeleb1 Dataset**:
   > Nagrani, A., Chung, J. S., & Zisserman, A. (2017). VoxCeleb: A large-scale speaker identification dataset. In *INTERSPEECH*.

2. **VoxCeleb2 Dataset**:
   > Chung, J. S., Nagrani, A., & Zisserman, A. (2018). VoxCeleb2: Deep speaker recognition. In *INTERSPEECH*.

After confirming the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference.

In summary, the key datasets extracted from the paper are:
- **VoxCeleb1 Dataset** with citation.
- **VoxCeleb2 Dataset** with citation.

This methodical approach ensures that I accurately capture all relevant datasets and their citations from the research paper.
