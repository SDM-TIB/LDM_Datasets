To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Navigating Scaling Laws: Compute Optimality in Adaptive Model Training" by Sotiris Anagnostidis et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a high-level overview, and the introduction often discusses the datasets used for experiments.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention training Vision Transformers on the **ImageNet-21k dataset**. This is a significant dataset in the field of computer vision, and I will need to gather more details about it.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors describe their experiments involving the **ImageNet-21k dataset** and also mention training on subsets of **English Wikipedia** and **Books** for language models. 

Now, I will compile the details of the datasets:

1. **ImageNet-21k Dataset**: This dataset consists of approximately 12 million images and 11,000 different classes. It is widely used for training and evaluating models in image classification tasks.

2. **English Wikipedia**: The authors mention using a subset of English Wikipedia for training language models. While specific details about the subset are not provided, it is a well-known dataset for natural language processing tasks.

3. **Books Dataset**: Similar to the Wikipedia dataset, the authors refer to using a dataset derived from books for training language models. Again, specific details are not provided, but it is commonly used in NLP research.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

- For the **ImageNet-21k dataset**, the citation is:
  > Ridnik, T., Ben-Baruch, E., Noy, A., & Zelnik-Manor, L. (2021). *ImageNet-21k pretraining for the masses*. 

- For the **English Wikipedia**, while it is a commonly used dataset, specific citation details may not be provided in the paper. However, it is generally referenced as:
  > English Wikipedia. (n.d.). Retrieved from https://en.wikipedia.org

- For the **Books dataset**, similar to Wikipedia, it may not have a specific citation in the paper, but it is often referenced in NLP literature as:
  > Books dataset. (n.d.). Various sources.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will summarize the findings in a structured manner, ensuring that each dataset is clearly documented with its citation for future reference or processing.
