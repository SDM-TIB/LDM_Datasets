To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Dynamics of a two-strain epidemic model with waning immunity - a perturbative approach" by Nir Gavish and Musa Rabiua, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus, but I need to look for specific datasets used in the research.

Next, I will examine the **results and discussion sections** to see if the authors mention any datasets used for simulations or analyses. I will pay attention to any figures or tables that might reference datasets, as these often contain crucial information about the data sources.

I will also check the **references section** for any citations that might indicate datasets. The authors may refer to previously published datasets or studies that provide the data they used in their analysis.

If the paper mentions specific datasets, I will note their names and descriptions. For example, if the authors refer to a dataset used for modeling or simulations, I will extract the relevant details such as the number of samples, variables included, and any specific characteristics of the dataset.

Once I have identified the datasets, I will ensure to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This may involve looking up the original papers or sources where the datasets were published.

For instance, if the authors refer to a dataset like "Dataset X" used in their analysis, I will find the original source and provide the full citation, including authors, title, publication venue, and year.

Finally, I will compile all the extracted datasets along with their full citations into a structured format for easy reference. This will ensure that I have a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, complete with proper citations for each one.
