To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Large Language Models Show Human-like Social Desirability Biases in Survey Responses" by Aadesh Salecha et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions an experimental framework using **Big Five personality surveys**, which suggests that a dataset related to personality assessments is involved.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, where the authors describe their experimental design. They mention using a **standardized 100-item Big Five personality questionnaire**, which is crucial for identifying the dataset. I will look for any specific details about the dataset, such as its source or citation.

In the **results section**, the authors discuss the outcomes of their experiments using the Big Five questionnaire. They do not introduce any new datasets but confirm the use of the Big Five personality assessment as a dataset for their analysis.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the Big Five personality questionnaire. The relevant citation is:

- For the **Big Five personality questionnaire**, the citation is:
  > Goldberg, L. R., Johnson, J. A., Eber, H. W., Hogan, R., & Ashton, M. C. (2006). *The international personality item pool (IPIP): A scientific collaboratory for the development of advanced measures of personality and other individual differences*. Available at: http://ipip.ori.org.

Since the paper primarily utilizes the Big Five personality questionnaire as the dataset, I will document this dataset along with its citation.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format that includes the dataset name and its full citation, ensuring that all necessary details are captured for future reference or processing.
