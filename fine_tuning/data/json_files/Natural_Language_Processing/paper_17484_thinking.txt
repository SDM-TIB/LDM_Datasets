To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DDistill-SR: Reparameterized Dynamic Distillation Network for Lightweight Image Super-Resolution" by Yan Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors have released code and discusses the performance of their method on various datasets, which suggests that datasets are indeed involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section IV), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for training and evaluation. Here, they mention using **DIV2K** and **Flick2K** for training, and they evaluate their model on several well-known datasets: **Set5**, **Set14**, **B100**, **Urban100**, and **Manga109**. This is a clear indication that these datasets are crucial for their experiments.

Now, I will gather detailed descriptions of each dataset mentioned:

1. **DIV2K**: This dataset is widely used in super-resolution tasks and contains 2,000 high-quality images. It is specifically designed for training super-resolution models.
   
2. **Flick2K**: This dataset consists of 2,000 high-quality images sourced from Flickr, also used for training super-resolution models.

3. **Set5**: A benchmark dataset for super-resolution that includes 5 images, commonly used for evaluating super-resolution algorithms.

4. **Set14**: Another benchmark dataset containing 14 images, used for performance evaluation in super-resolution tasks.

5. **B100**: This dataset consists of 100 images and is often used for testing super-resolution algorithms.

6. **Urban100**: A dataset containing 100 images of urban scenes, used for evaluating the performance of super-resolution methods in complex environments.

7. **Manga109**: This dataset includes 109 manga images and is used for testing super-resolution algorithms, particularly in the context of manga and comic images.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for future researchers.
