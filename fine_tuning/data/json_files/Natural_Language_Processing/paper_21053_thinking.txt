To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Adapting to Length Shift: FlexiLength Network for Trajectory Prediction" by Yi Xu and Yun Fu, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors conducted comprehensive experiments on multiple datasets, specifically naming **ETH/UCY, nuScenes, and Argoverse 1**. This indicates that these datasets are likely central to the research.

Next, I will look into **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the datasets used. Here, they explicitly mention:

1. **ETH/UCY Dataset**: This dataset is described as a primary benchmark for pedestrian trajectory prediction, consisting of five datasets: Eth, Hotel, Univ, Zara1, and Zara2, with densely interactive trajectories sampled at 2.5Hz.

2. **nuScenes Dataset**: This is identified as a large autonomous driving dataset featuring 1000 scenes, each annotated at 2Hz, and includes HD maps with 11 semantic classes.

3. **Argoverse 1**: This dataset contains 323,557 real-world driving sequences sampled at 10Hz, complemented with HD maps for trajectory prediction.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **ETH/UCY Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Alon Lerner, Yiorgos Chrysanthou, and Dani Lischinski. *Crowds by example*. In Computer graphics forum, pages 655–664. Wiley Online Library, 2007.

- For the **nuScenes Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Holger Caesar, Varun Bankiti, Alex H Lang, Sourabh Vora, Venice Erin Liong, Qiang Xu, Anush Krishnan, Yu Pan, Giancarlo Baldan, and Oscar Beijbom. *nuScenes: A multi-modal dataset for autonomous driving*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 11621–11631, 2020.

- For the **Argoverse 1**, the citation is:
  > Ming-Fang Chang, John Lambert, Patsorn Sangkloy, Jagjeet Singh, Slawomir Bak, Andrew Hartnett, De Wang, Peter Carr, Simon Lucey, Deva Ramanan, et al. *Argoverse: 3D tracking and forecasting with rich maps*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 8748–8757, 2019.

With this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
