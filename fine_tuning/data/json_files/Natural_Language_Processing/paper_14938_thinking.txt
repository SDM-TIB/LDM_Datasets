To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DemoSG: Demonstration-enhanced Schema-guided Generation for Low-resource Event Extraction" by Gang Zhao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions conducting extensive experiments on three datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they state that they evaluate their method on two widely used event extraction benchmarks: **ACE05-EN** and **ACE05-EN+**. I will note down the details provided about these datasets, including their characteristics and any relevant statistics.

In the **dataset statistics table** (Table 1), the authors provide detailed information about the datasets, including the number of sentences, events, and roles for both ACE05-EN and ACE05-EN+. This information is crucial for understanding the datasets' scope and application.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The authors reference the original papers that describe the ACE datasets:

1. For **ACE05-EN**, the citation is:
   > Wadden, D., Wennberg, U., Luan, Y., & Hajishirzi, H. (2019). Entity, relation, and event extraction with contextualized span representations. *arXiv preprint arXiv:1909.03546*.

2. For **ACE05-EN+**, the citation is:
   > Lin, Y., Ji, H., Huang, F., & Wu, L. (2020). A joint neural model for information extraction with global features. In *Proceedings of the 58th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics*, pages 7999â€“8009.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described with its full citation, as this is essential for proper attribution and further research.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for easy reference and potential downstream processing.
