To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "Neural Approximate Dynamic Programming for the Ultra-fast Order Dispatching Problem" by Arash Dehghan et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors tested their approach using **four distinct realistic datasets tailored for ODP**, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors describe the datasets used in their numerical study. Here, they explicitly mention four datasets:

1. **Brooklyn Dataset**: This dataset contains delivery data for online DoorDash requests within Brooklyn, New York. It includes latitude-longitude points for drop-off locations associated with real-world order requests.

2. **Chicago Dataset**: Similar to the Brooklyn dataset, this dataset encompasses delivery data for online DoorDash requests within Chicago, Illinois, also including latitude-longitude points for drop-off locations.

3. **Bangalore Dataset**: This dataset incorporates order requests from restaurants in Bangalore, India, and includes latitude-longitude points for drop-off locations.

4. **Iowa Dataset**: Introduced by Ulmer et al., this dataset comprises destination locations for meal deliveries within Iowa City, also featuring latitude-longitude points for drop-off locations.

In this section, the authors provide additional details about the datasets, such as the number of unique destination locations for each dataset: Brooklyn (988), Chicago (500), Bangalore (77), and Iowa (117).

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **Brooklyn Dataset**:

  > Ulmer, M.W., Thomas, B.W., 2021. *The restaurant meal delivery problem: Dynamic pickup and delivery with deadlines and random ready times*. Transportation Science 55, 75â€“100.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
