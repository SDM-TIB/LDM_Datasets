To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Defending Large Language Models Against Jailbreak Attacks via Layer-specific Editing" by Wei Zhao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of various datasets for experiments, which indicates that there are datasets to be identified.

In the **introduction**, the authors reference several models and methods but do not explicitly mention datasets. However, they do discuss the vulnerabilities of LLMs and the need for effective defenses, which suggests that datasets may be used for evaluation purposes.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**. Here, the authors detail their experimental setup, including the datasets used. They mention utilizing **Advbench** for generating adversarial prompts and **Trojan Detection Competition 2023** for harmful prompts. This is a critical point as it directly identifies two datasets used in their research.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

1. **Advbench**: This dataset is referenced in the context of generating adversarial prompts. The citation is:
   > Zou, A., Wang, Z., Kolter, J. Z., & Fredrikson, M. (2023). Universal and transferable adversarial attacks on aligned language models. arXiv preprint arXiv:2307.15043.

2. **Trojan Detection Competition 2023**: This dataset is used for harmful prompts. The citation is:
   > TDC 2023 Organizers. (2023). The trojan detection challenge 2023 (llm edition). Retrieved from https://trojandetection.ai/ [Accessed: 2023-11-28].

After identifying these datasets and their citations, I will compile the information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset, its purpose, and the corresponding citations.

This systematic approach ensures that I accurately extract and document the datasets used in the research paper, maintaining the integrity of the information and providing proper credit to the original sources.
