To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deriva-ML: A Continuous FAIRness Approach to Reproducible Machine Learning Models" by Zhiwei Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their full citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the importance of high-quality data for machine learning and hints at the use of specific datasets in their proposed architecture.

Next, I will focus on the **use cases section (Section VI)**, as it is likely to contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used in their experiments. The authors present two use cases: **EyeAI - Glaucoma Detection** and **MusMorph Genotype Prediction**. I will extract information about the datasets used in these cases.

In the **EyeAI use case**, the authors mention that the team used fundus photographs from a clinical diabetic retinopathy screening program. I need to find the exact name of this dataset and any relevant details. They also discuss the creation of training, validation, and test datasets based on the subjects' diagnoses, but I need to confirm if these datasets have specific names or citations.

In the **MusMorph use case**, the authors describe standardized mouse morphology data collected through experiments. I will look for the specific dataset names and any associated details.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. This is crucial for ensuring that I provide accurate and complete references for each dataset.

For the **EyeAI use case**, I will look for the citation of the diabetic retinopathy dataset, which may be referenced in the paper. If it is not explicitly mentioned, I will note that the dataset is derived from a clinical program and may not have a formal citation.

For the **MusMorph use case**, I will look for any references to the standardized mouse morphology data and its associated citation.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and that full citations are included. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, adhering to the importance of proper citation in academic work.
