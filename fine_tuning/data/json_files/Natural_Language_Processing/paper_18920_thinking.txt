To extract datasets from the research paper titled "OS-Copilot: Towards Generalist Computer Agents with Self-Improvement" by Zhiyong Wu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the performance of FRIDAY on the GAIA benchmark, which suggests that GAIA is a dataset used for evaluation.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, they mention evaluating FRIDAY on the **GAIA** benchmark and the **SheetCopilot-20** dataset. 

1. **GAIA Dataset**: This dataset is referenced as a benchmark for general AI assistants featuring 466 challenging question-answering tasks. The paper indicates that FRIDAY was evaluated on this dataset, showcasing its performance metrics.

2. **SheetCopilot-20 Dataset**: This dataset includes 20 spreadsheet control tasks, covering various operations such as formatting, management, charts, pivot tables, and formulas. The authors mention that FRIDAY was self-instructed to generate tasks related to manipulating Excel using this dataset.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **GAIA dataset**, the citation is:
  > Grégroire Mialon, Clémentine Fourrier, Craig Swift, Thomas Wolf, Yann LeCun, and Thomas Scialom. *GAIA: A Benchmark for General AI Assistants*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2311.12983, 2023.

- For the **SheetCopilot-20 dataset**, the citation is:
  > Hongxin Li, Jingran Su, Yuntao Chen, Qing Li, and Zhaoxiang Zhang. *SheetCopilot: Bringing Software Productivity to the Next Level through Large Language Models*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2305.19308, 2023.

With these citations, I have now gathered the necessary information about the datasets used in the paper. I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and future reference.
