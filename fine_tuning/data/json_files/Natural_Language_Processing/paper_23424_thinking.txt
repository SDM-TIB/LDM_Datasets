To extract datasets from the research paper titled "How to Count Coughs: An Event-Based Framework for Evaluating Automatic Cough Detection Algorithm Performance" by Lara Orlandic et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of wearable devices and machine learning algorithms for cough counting, which suggests that datasets are involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention the need for objective metrics to track cough symptoms, hinting at the use of datasets for evaluation. I will look for specific dataset names or references in this section.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly where the authors describe their experimental setup. They mention using "the only known open dataset to delineate the start and stop times of each individual cough sound." This indicates that a specific dataset is being utilized, and I need to find its name and details.

Upon reviewing the methods, I find that the dataset used is the **COUGHVID dataset**, which is referenced in the context of augmenting the training dataset. This dataset is crucial for understanding the performance of the cough counting algorithms.

In the **results section**, the authors discuss the performance metrics derived from the dataset, but they do not introduce any new datasets. Therefore, I will focus on the previously identified dataset.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the **COUGHVID dataset**. The relevant citation is:

- For **COUGHVID dataset**:
  > L. Orlandic et al., “A Multimodal Dataset for Automatic Edge-AI Cough Detection,” in IEEE EMBC, Sydney, Jul. 2023, pp. 1–7.

Since the authors have created a novel dataset for their research, I will ensure to include this citation in my dataset entry.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including the dataset name, description, and full citation, into a structured format for clarity and future reference.
