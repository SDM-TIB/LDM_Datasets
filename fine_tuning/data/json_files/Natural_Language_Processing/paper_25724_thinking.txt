To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Behavioral Testing: Can Large Language Models Implicitly Resolve Ambiguous Entities?" by Anastasiia Sedova et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to find any references to datasets. The abstract mentions testing state-of-the-art LLMs on **49 entities**, which suggests that there is a dataset involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Methodology)**, where the authors describe the set of entities used for their experiments. They explicitly mention using **49 entities** categorized into **7 entity types**: animals, fruits, myths, persons, locations, companies, and abstracts. This section provides a clear indication of the dataset being utilized.

In **Table 1**, the paper lists the entities along with their types, which confirms the dataset's structure. The entities include:
- Animals: Jaguar, Puma, Penguin, Greyhound, Dove, Fox, Lynx
- Fruits: Apple, Fig, Mango, Kiwi, Papaya, Orange
- Myths: Pegasus, Vulcan, Midas, Nike, Mars, Hyperion, Hermes, Amazon
- Persons: Ford, Disney, Tesla, Boeing, Dell, Ferrero, Benetton, Levi Strauss, Versace, Philips
- Locations: Cisco, Prosper, Patagonia, Montblanc, Amazon, Nokia, Hershey, Eagle Creek
- Abstract: Triumph, Harmony, Genesis, Vision, Pioneer, Vanguard, Zenith, Allure, Tempo, Fidelity

I will also check the **References section** to find any citations related to the datasets. However, since the entities are common knowledge and do not refer to a specific dataset publication, I will note that the dataset is derived from the authors' own compilation based on various sources.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with the necessary citations:

1. **Entity Dataset**: The dataset consists of 49 entities categorized into 7 types, as described in the paper. The entities are chosen to have at least two readings: the listed entity type and company.

The citation for the dataset is:
> Sedova, A., Litschko, R., Frassinelli, D., Roth, B., & Plank, B. (2024). Behavioral Testing: Can Large Language Models Implicitly Resolve Ambiguous Entities? arXiv:2404.XXXX.

After gathering this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for further processing or review, ensuring that each dataset is clearly documented with its citation.
