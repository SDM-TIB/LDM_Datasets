To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Bridging the Gap between Multi-focus and Multi-modal: A Focused Integration Framework for Multi-modal Image Fusion" by Xilai Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments on existing MMIF datasets, which indicates that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Dataset generation)**, where the authors describe the creation of a new dataset. They mention integrating two publicly available MMIF datasets: **TNO** and **RoadScene**. This section will provide specific details about these datasets and their relevance to the study.

In the dataset generation section, the authors explain how they generated a new dataset by using the TNO and RoadScene datasets. They describe the process of creating multi-focus images by blurring certain regions of the visible images, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's purpose.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. For the **TNO dataset**, the citation is:
   > Alexander Toet et al. *TNO Image Fusion Dataset*. Figshare data, 2014.

2. For the **RoadScene dataset**, the citation is:
   > Han Xu, Jiayi Ma, Junjun Jiang, Xiaojie Guo, and Haibin Ling. *U2Fusion: A Unified Unsupervised Image Fusion Network*. IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 44(1):502â€“518, 2020.

With these citations, I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets used in the research paper. I will now compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
