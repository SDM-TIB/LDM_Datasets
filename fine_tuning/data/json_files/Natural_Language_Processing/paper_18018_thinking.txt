To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-View Near-field Imaging in NLOS with Non-Reconfigurable EM Skins" by Davide Tornielli Bellini et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for validation. In this paper, the authors discuss the simulation results and the parameters used, which may include datasets or synthetic data generated for their experiments.

I will also check the **results section** for any specific mentions of datasets or data sources that were utilized in the simulations or analyses. If the authors refer to any publicly available datasets or proprietary datasets, I will note those down.

After identifying the datasets, I will look for the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, if the authors mention a dataset like "Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data" or "NLOS imaging datasets," I will search for the original sources or papers that describe these datasets to provide accurate citations.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is clearly documented.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for easy reference and use in future research or applications.
