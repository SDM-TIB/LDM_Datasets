To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Evaluating Large Language Models with NeuBAROCO: Syllogistic Reasoning Ability and Human-like Biases" by Risako Ando et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract introduces a dataset called **NeuBAROCO**, which is specifically designed for assessing human logical abilities in syllogistic reasoning. This indicates that there is a dataset of interest.

Next, I will look into **section 3 (The NeuBAROCO dataset)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset. They describe how the NeuBAROCO dataset is derived from the original **BAROCO dataset** and consists of 375 inference problems, categorized into different types based on logical inferences. This section will provide the necessary details about the dataset's structure and content.

In this section, the authors also mention that the **BAROCO dataset** was used in various studies to evaluate human syllogistic reasoning abilities, which is crucial for understanding the context of NeuBAROCO. The original BAROCO dataset is referenced as being used in studies by Shikishima et al. (2006, 2009), which I will need to cite.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for both datasets:

1. **NeuBAROCO**: The paper does not provide a separate citation for NeuBAROCO since it is a new dataset introduced in this paper. However, I will note that it is derived from the BAROCO dataset.

2. **BAROCO Dataset**: The citation for the original BAROCO dataset is:
   > Chizuru Shikishima, Kai Hiraishi, Shinji Yamagata, Yutaro Sugimoto, Ryo Takemura, Koken Ozaki, Mitsuhiro Okada, Tatsushi Toda, and Juko Ando. *Is g an entity? a Japanese twin study using syllogisms and intelligence tests*. Intelligence, 37(3):256–267, 2009.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

- **Dataset Name**: NeuBAROCO
  - **Description**: A dataset consisting of 375 syllogistic inference problems designed to assess human-like biases in logical reasoning.
  - **Citation**: Not applicable as it is introduced in this paper.

- **Dataset Name**: BAROCO
  - **Description**: A collection of logical inference questions used to evaluate human logical inference abilities, originally comprising 209 logical inferences.
  - **Citation**: Chizuru Shikishima, Kai Hiraishi, Shinji Yamagata, Yutaro Sugimoto, Ryo Takemura, Koken Ozaki, Mitsuhiro Okada, Tatsushi Toda, and Juko Ando. *Is g an entity? a Japanese twin study using syllogisms and intelligence tests*. Intelligence, 37(3):256–267, 2009.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
