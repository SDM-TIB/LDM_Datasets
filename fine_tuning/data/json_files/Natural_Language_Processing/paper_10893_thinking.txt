To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Improved Instruction Ordering in Recipe-Grounded Conversation" by Duong Minh Le et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and dataset construction sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions a newly collected dataset called **ChattyChef**, which is a strong indicator that this is a primary dataset of interest.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors discuss the challenges in recipe-grounded dialogue and mention the **ChattyChef** dataset as a means to support their research. This confirms its significance in the study.

In the **dataset construction section**, the authors provide detailed information about how the **ChattyChef** dataset was created, including the methodology of crowdsourcing conversations based on WikiHow recipes. They also mention the criteria for selecting recipes, which adds context to the dataset's quality and relevance.

I will also look for any other datasets referenced in the paper. In the **User Intent Detection** section, the authors mention using existing dialogue intent datasets such as **MultiWOZ 2.2** and **Schema Guided Dialogue** for their experiments. This indicates that these datasets are also relevant to the research.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

1. **ChattyChef**: The paper does not provide a formal citation for this dataset since it is newly created and will be released by the authors. However, I will note that it can be accessed at the provided GitHub link: https://github.com/octaviaguo/ChattyChef.

2. **MultiWOZ 2.2**: The citation for this dataset is:
   > Budzianowski, P., Wen, T.-H., Tseng, B.-H., Casanueva, I., Ultes, S., Ramadan, O., & Gašić, M. (2018). MultiWOZ - a large-scale multi-domain Wizard-of-Oz dataset for task-oriented dialogue modelling. In Proceedings of the 2018 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), pages 5016–5026, Brussels, Belgium. Association for Computational Linguistics.

3. **Schema Guided Dialogue**: The citation for this dataset is:
   > Rastogi, A., Zang, X., Sunkara, S., Gupta, R., & Khaitan, P. (2020). Towards scalable multi-domain conversational agents: The schema-guided dialogue dataset. In Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, volume 34.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
