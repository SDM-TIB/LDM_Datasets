To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Arondight: Red Teaming Large Vision Language Models with Auto-generated Multi-modal Jailbreak Prompts" by Yi Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or data sources used in their experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this paper, they mention a **multimodal prompt dataset** that will be released after ethics committee approval. I will look for any specific names or details about this dataset.

In the **background and related work section**, the authors may reference existing datasets that are relevant to their work. I will note any datasets mentioned here, especially if they are foundational to their research.

I will also check the **results section** for any additional datasets that might be referenced in the context of their findings. The authors may discuss how their framework was evaluated against existing datasets or benchmarks.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets.

For example, if the authors mention a dataset like **JailbreakBench**, I will look for its citation in the references. If it is not explicitly cited, I will search for the original paper or source that introduced the dataset to ensure I have the correct citation.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each entry is clear and accurately reflects the content of the paper.

Finally, I will format the extracted information according to the required structure, ready for further processing or review.
