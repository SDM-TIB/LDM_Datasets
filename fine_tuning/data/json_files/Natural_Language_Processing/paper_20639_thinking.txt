To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SiMBA: Simplified Mamba-based Architecture for Vision and Multivariate Time series" by Badri N. Patro and Vijay S. Agneeswaran, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that SiMBA has been validated on "image and time-series benchmarks," which indicates that there are specific datasets used for these evaluations. I will look for explicit mentions of these datasets.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (section 4) closely, as it typically contains detailed information about the datasets used for training and evaluation. In this section, the authors describe their experiments on various tasks, including image recognition and time series forecasting. 

In **subsection 4.1**, the authors mention the **ImageNet** dataset for image recognition tasks, stating that they trained and evaluated their model on this dataset. They also refer to **CIFAR-10**, **CIFAR-100**, **Stanford Cars**, and **Flowers-102** as transfer learning datasets. This is crucial information, as it specifies the datasets used in their experiments.

In **subsection 4.2**, the authors discuss their evaluation on seven benchmark datasets for multivariate time series forecasting, including **Electricity**, **Weather**, **Traffic**, and four datasets from the ETT series (ETTh1, ETTh2, ETTm1, ETTm2). This provides a comprehensive list of datasets used for time series analysis.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the **References section** of the paper. This is essential for proper attribution and to ensure that the datasets can be easily located by others.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, facilitating further exploration and validation by other researchers.
