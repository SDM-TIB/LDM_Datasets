To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Tree in Tree: from Decision Trees to Decision Graphs" by Bingzhao Zhu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to look for any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research but may not contain detailed dataset information. The introduction often outlines the context and significance of the research, which might include mentions of datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this paper, the authors mention several datasets in the context of evaluating their proposed Tree in Tree (TnT) algorithm. Specifically, I will look for any tables or figures that summarize the datasets, as they often provide concise information about the dataset characteristics.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors explicitly mention the following datasets used in their experiments:

1. **MNIST**: A well-known dataset for handwritten digit classification, consisting of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images, each of size 28x28 pixels.
2. **Connect-4**: A dataset used for the game of Connect Four, which includes 67,557 instances.
3. **Letter**: A dataset for letter recognition, containing 20,000 instances.
4. **Optical Recognition**: A dataset for optical character recognition, with 5,620 instances.
5. **Pendigits**: A dataset for handwritten digit recognition, consisting of 3,500 instances.
6. **Protein**: A dataset for protein classification, containing 45,730 instances.
7. **SenseIT**: A dataset for sensor data classification, with 1,000 instances.
8. **USPS**: A dataset for handwritten digit recognition, containing 9,298 instances.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The paper references the UCI Machine Learning Repository and LIBSVM Dataset for some of the datasets, which are common sources for machine learning datasets.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
