To extract datasets from the research paper titled "UP4LS: User Profile Constructed by Multiple Attributes for Enhancing Linguistic Steganalysis" by Yihao Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the UP4LS framework and its effectiveness in enhancing linguistic steganalysis, which suggests that datasets are likely involved in the experiments.

In the **introduction**, I will look for any references to datasets used for experiments. The authors discuss the challenges of detecting steganographic texts in social networks and mention that they utilize posts from multiple users, which indicates that datasets are being constructed from these posts.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, particularly **subsection 4.1 (Settings)**, where the authors describe the datasets they constructed. Here, they mention that they created datasets with varying ratios of cover to stego texts, specifically:

1. **User Posts Dataset**: This dataset consists of posts collected from 10 different users on Twitter. The authors specify that they generated stegos using the Adaptive Dynamic Grouping (ADG) algorithm, which is referenced in the context of the dataset.

The authors also provide details about the ratios of cover to stego texts used in their experiments, which are 50:1, 100:1, 200:1, and 500:1 for training sets, with a uniform ratio of 1:1 for testing sets. This information is crucial for understanding the dataset's structure.

Now, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The key references related to the datasets are:

- For the **ADG algorithm**, the citation is:
  > Zhang, L., Hu, X., Wang, B., Zhou, D., Zhang, Q.-W., & Cao, Y. (2021). Provably secure generative linguistic steganography. In Proceedings of the International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing (ACL-IJCNLP), pages 3046â€“3055.

- The user posts dataset does not have a specific citation since it is constructed from publicly available Twitter data, but it is important to note that the data collection is ethical and follows guidelines.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets in a structured manner, ensuring that each dataset is clearly defined and accompanied by its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
