To extract datasets from the research paper titled "New Benchmark Dataset and Fine-Grained Cross-Modal Fusion Framework for Vietnamese Multimodal Aspect-Category Sentiment Analysis" by Quy Hoang Nguyen et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract introduces a new dataset called **ViMACSA**, which consists of 4,876 text-image pairs with fine-grained annotations. This is a clear indication that a dataset is present.

Next, I will look into **section 3 (Benchmark Dataset Creation)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset creation process. Here, they describe the **ViMACSA dataset** in depth, including its characteristics, the number of samples, and the types of annotations included. This section confirms that the dataset is specifically designed for the task of Multimodal Aspect-Category Sentiment Analysis (MACSA).

In **section 3.5 (Dataset Analysis)**, the authors present statistics about the dataset, including the number of text-image pairs and the distribution of aspect categories. This further solidifies the importance of the **ViMACSA dataset** in their research.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. Since the dataset is newly introduced in this paper, it may not have a separate citation. However, the authors mention that the dataset is available for research purposes and provide a link to their GitHub repository for access.

The citation for the dataset can be structured as follows:
> Nguyen, Q. H., Truong, M.-V., & Nguyen, K. V. (2024). *ViMACSA: A Vietnamese multimodal dataset for Aspect-Category Sentiment Analysis*. Available at: https://github.com/ViMACSA

Now, I will compile the dataset entry for **ViMACSA** using the information gathered:

1. **ViMACSA Dataset**: This dataset consists of 4,876 text-image pairs with fine-grained annotations for both text and image in the hotel domain.

Finally, I will ensure that I have accurately captured the essence of the dataset and its citation for future reference or processing.
