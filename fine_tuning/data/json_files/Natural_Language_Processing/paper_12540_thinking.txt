To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Worrisome Properties of Neural Network Controllers and Their Symbolic Representations" by Jacek Cyranka et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the robustness of neural network controllers and mentions "simple reinforcement learning benchmark problems," which suggests that datasets may be involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this paper, they mention two specific benchmark problems: the **pendulum problem** and the **cartpole swing-up problem**. I will look for any references to datasets associated with these problems.

In the **section detailing the studied problems**, the authors describe the dynamics of the pendulum and cartpole systems, but they do not provide specific dataset names. However, they reference the **OpenAI Gym** for the pendulum problem and the **DeepMind control suite** for the cartpole swing-up problem. This indicates that the datasets are likely derived from these established benchmarks.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **OpenAI Gym**, the citation is:
   > Greg Brockman, Vicki Cheung, Ludwig Pettersson, Jonas Schneider, John Schulman, Jie Tang, and Wojciech Zaremba. *OpenAI Gym*, 2016.

2. For the **DeepMind Control Suite**, the citation is:
   > Yuval Tassa, Yotam Doron, Alistair Muldal, Tom Erez, Yazhe Li, Diego de Las Casas, David Budden, Abbas Abdolmaleki, Josh Merel, Andrew Lefrancq, Timothy Lillicrap, and Martin Riedmiller. *DeepMind Control Suite*, arXiv e-prints, arXiv:1801.00690, 2018.

With these citations, I can now compile the dataset entries. The datasets extracted from the paper are:

- **Pendulum Problem Dataset**: Derived from the OpenAI Gym.
- **Cartpole Swing-Up Problem Dataset**: Derived from the DeepMind Control Suite.

Finally, I will ensure that each dataset entry includes the full citation for proper attribution. This structured approach allows me to systematically extract and document the datasets referenced in the research paper.
