To extract datasets from the research paper titled "New contexts, old heuristics: How young people in India and the US trust online content in the age of generative AI" by Rachel Xu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and findings sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, but I will need to delve deeper into the methodology and findings to uncover specific datasets.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss their research questions and the context of their study, but they do not mention any datasets directly. I will move on to the **methodology section**, where they describe their participant recruitment and data collection methods. Here, they mention that they conducted an in-person ethnography with 52 participants aged 18-24 in two locations: Bangalore, India, and the New York metro area, USA. However, they do not specify any datasets in this section.

Next, I will examine the **findings section**. This section outlines the results of their research, including the concept of "information modes" and how participants interacted with generative AI. While the findings are rich in qualitative insights, they do not reference any specific datasets that can be cited.

After thoroughly reviewing the paper, it appears that the authors did not utilize any publicly available datasets or create new datasets that are explicitly named in the text. Instead, their research is based on qualitative data collected from interviews and ethnographic observations.

Since there are no datasets to extract or cite, I will summarize my findings regarding the absence of datasets in this research paper. I will note that the study relies on qualitative data from participant interviews rather than quantitative datasets.

In conclusion, I will prepare a brief summary indicating that no datasets were identified in the paper, and therefore, there are no citations to provide. This will ensure clarity in my output regarding the dataset extraction process.
