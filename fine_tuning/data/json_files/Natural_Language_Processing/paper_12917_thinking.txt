To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Few-Shot Data-to-Text Generation via Unified Representation and Multi-Source Learning" by Alexander Hanbo Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions a novel approach for structured data-to-text generation, which suggests that datasets are likely involved. I will look for any specific mentions of datasets in these sections.

In the **introduction**, I will pay attention to any references to datasets used for evaluation or training. The authors may describe the datasets in the context of their methodology or results.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly the subsection labeled **Datasets**. Here, the authors explicitly list the datasets they used for their experiments. In this paper, they mention five datasets:

1. **ToTTo Dataset**: This dataset is used for generating one-sentence descriptions from highlighted cells in Wikipedia tables. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Parikh, A., et al. (2020). *ToTTo: A Controlled Table-to-Text Generation Dataset*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2004.14373.

2. **DART Corpus**: An open-domain structured data-to-text resource consisting of entity-relation triples. The citation is:
   > Nan, L., et al. (2021). *DART: Open-domain Structured Data Record to Text Generation*. In Proceedings of the 2021 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, pages 432–447.

3. **LogicNLG Dataset**: This dataset investigates generating logical inferences from table contents. The citation is:
   > Chen, W., et al. (2020). *Logical Natural Language Generation from Open-Domain Tables*. In Proceedings of the 58th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, pages 7929–7942.

4. **WebNLG Dataset**: This dataset includes triples from DBpedia categories mapped to their verbalization. The citation is:
   > Gardent, C., et al. (2017). *The WebNLG Challenge: Generating Text from RDF Data*. In Proceedings of the 10th International Conference on Natural Language Generation, pages 124–133.

5. **E2E Clean Dataset**: This dataset consists of meaning representations from the restaurant domain. The citation is:
   > Dušek, O., et al. (2019). *Semantic Noise Matters for Neural Natural Language Generation*. In Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Natural Language Generation, pages 421–426.

After identifying these datasets, I will ensure to verify their citations by checking the **References section** of the paper to confirm that I have the correct details.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information along with their citations into a structured format for easy reference and further processing. This will ensure that I have accurately captured all relevant datasets and their citations from the paper.
