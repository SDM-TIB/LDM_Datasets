To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "One-Versus-Others Attention: Scalable Multimodal Integration for Clinical Data" by Michal Golovanevsky et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant details, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors used **four clinical datasets with diverse modalities**, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Dataset descriptions)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used in their experiments. This section is likely to contain the specific names and characteristics of the datasets.

The datasets mentioned in this section are:

1. **TADPOLE Dataset**: This dataset is derived from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and includes neuroimaging data, cognitive test scores, biomarker profiles, and genetic information. The citation for this dataset is:
   > R˘azvan V Marinescu, Neil P Oxtoby, Alexandra L Young, Esther E Bron, Arthur W Toga, Michael W Weiner, Frederik Barkhof, Nick C Fox, Polina Golland, Stefan Klein, et al. *TADPOLE challenge: Accurate Alzheimer’s disease prediction through crowdsourced forecasting of future data*. In Predictive Intelligence in Medicine: Second International Workshop, PRIME 2019, Held in Conjunction with MICCAI 2019, Shenzhen, China, October 13, 2019, Proceedings 2, pages 1–10. Springer, 2019.

2. **TCGA Dataset**: The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset molecularly characterizes over 20,000 primary cancers and matched normal samples. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network et al. *Comprehensive molecular characterization of human colon and rectal cancer*. Nature, 487(7407):330, 2012.

3. **MIMIC-IV and CXR**: The MIMIC-IV dataset covers ICU visits and the MIMIC Chest X-ray dataset contains chest radiographs. The citation for MIMIC-IV is:
   > Alistair Johnson, Matt Lungren, Yifan Peng, Zhiyong Lu, Roger Mark, Seth Berkowitz, and Steven Horng. *MIMIC-IV, a freely accessible electronic health record dataset*. Scientific data, 10(1):1, 2023.
   The citation for MIMIC-CXR is:
   > Alistair Johnson, Matt Lungren, Yifan Peng, Zhiyong Lu, Roger Mark, Seth Berkowitz, and Steven Horng. *MIMIC-CXR-JPG-chest radiographs with structured labels*. PhysioNet, 2019.

4. **eICU Dataset**: The eICU collaborative database encompasses data from ICUs across the continental United States. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Tom J Pollard, Alistair EW Johnson, Jesse D Raffa, Leo A Celi, Roger G Mark, and Omar Badawi. *The eICU collaborative research database, a freely available multi-center database for critical care research*. Scientific data, 5(1):1–13, 2018.

After identifying these datasets, I will ensure that I have the correct full citations for each one, as they are crucial for proper referencing in any subsequent analysis or reporting.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and full citation, ready for further processing or review.
