To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Progressive Query Expansion for Retrieval Over Cost-constrained Data Sources" by Muhammad Shihab Rashid et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental evaluation sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on **four retrieval datasets**, which indicates that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental evaluation section** (Section 3), where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. They mention:

1. **Natural Questions (NQ)**: A dataset designed for question answering, which includes questions and corresponding answers from Wikipedia articles.
2. **Web Questions (WQ)**: A dataset that consists of questions and answers derived from web pages, aimed at evaluating open-domain question answering systems.
3. **TREC DL19**: A dataset from the TREC Deep Learning track, which includes queries and relevant passages for evaluating retrieval systems.
4. **TREC DL20**: Another dataset from the TREC Deep Learning track, similar to DL19 but with different queries and passages.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for each of these datasets:

- For **Natural Questions (NQ)**, the citation is:
  > Tom Kwiatkowski, Jennimaria Palomaki, Olivia Redfield, Michael Collins, Ankur Parikh, Chris Alberti, Danielle Epstein, Illia Polosukhin, Jacob Devlin, Kenton Lee, et al. *Natural questions: a benchmark for question answering research*. Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics 7 (2019), 453–466.

- For **Web Questions (WQ)**, the citation is:
  > Jonathan Berant, Andrew Chou, Roy Frostig, and Percy Liang. *Semantic parsing on freebase from question-answer pairs*. In Proceedings of the 2013 conference on empirical methods in natural language processing. 1533–1544.

- For **TREC DL19**, the citation is:
  > Nick Craswell, Bhaskar Mitra, Emine Yilmaz, Daniel Campos, and Ellen M. Voorhees. *Overview of the TREC 2019 deep learning track*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2003.07820 (2020).

- For **TREC DL20**, the citation is:
  > Nick Craswell, Bhaskar Mitra, Emine Yilmaz, Daniel Campos, and Ellen M. Voorhees. *Overview of the TREC 2020 deep learning track*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2003.07820 (2020).

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. Each dataset will be documented with its name, description, and full citation to ensure clarity and proper attribution.
