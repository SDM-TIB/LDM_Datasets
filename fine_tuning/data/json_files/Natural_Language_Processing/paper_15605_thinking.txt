To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Efficient LLM Inference on CPUs" by Haihao Shen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract mentions evaluating the approach on popular LLMs and references datasets from the **lm-evaluation-harness**, which indicates that datasets are indeed involved.

Next, I will look closely at **section 3 (Results)**, particularly the **3.1 Experimental Setup** subsection, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for evaluation. The datasets mentioned are:

1. **LAMBADA**: This dataset is referenced for its requirement of broad discourse context for word prediction.
2. **HellaSwag**: This dataset is mentioned as a challenge for machines to complete sentences.
3. **Winogrande**: This dataset is noted for its adversarial Winograd schema challenge.
4. **PIQA**: This dataset is referenced for reasoning about physical commonsense in natural language.
5. **WikiText**: This dataset is commonly used for language modeling tasks.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each of these datasets:

- For **LAMBADA**, the citation is:
  > Paperno, D., Kruszewski, G., Lazaridou, A., Pham, Q. N., Bernardi, R., Pezzelle, S., Baroni, M., Boleda, G., & Fernández, R. (2016). The LAMBADA dataset: Word prediction requiring a broad discourse context. In Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, 34, 7432–7439.

- For **HellaSwag**, the citation is:

- For **Winogrande**, the citation is:

- For **PIQA**, the citation is:
  > Bisk, Y., Zellers, R., Gao, J., & Choi, Y. (2020). PIQA: Reasoning about physical commonsense in natural language. In Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, 34, 7432–7439.

- For **WikiText**, the citation is:
  > Merity, S., Keskar, N. S., & Socher, R. (2017). Regularizing and Optimizing LSTM Language Models. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR).

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
