To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Closer Look at Wav2Vec2 Embeddings for On-Device Single-Channel Speech Enhancement" by Ravi Shankar et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus but does not explicitly mention datasets. The introduction discusses the challenges of speech enhancement but does not specify any datasets either.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly **section 3.1 (Dataset)**, where the authors explicitly mention the dataset used for their experiments. Here, they state that they used the **DNS Challenge corpus** for their experiments, which is crucial information.

I will then look for any additional details about the dataset within the same section. The authors describe how they mixed clean speech and noise samples at random SNRs for training and validation, and they specify that the testing set consists of 500 samples from the Librispeech test-clean dataset mixed with noise at a fixed -5dB SNR. This indicates that two datasets are involved: the DNS Challenge corpus and the Librispeech dataset.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **DNS Challenge corpus**, the citation is:
   > Chandan K A Reddy, Harishchandra Dubey, Kazuhito Koishida, Arun Nair, Vishak Gopal, Ross Cutler, Sebastian Braun, Hannes Gamper, Robert Aichner, and Sridhar Srinivasan. *Interspeech 2021 Deep Noise Suppression Challenge*, 2021.

2. For the **Librispeech dataset**, the citation is:
   > Vassil Panayotov, Guoguo Chen, Kainan Peng, and T. S. Huang. *Librispeech: An ASR corpus based on public domain audio books*. In Proceedings of the 2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP), pages 5206â€“5210, 2015.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all details are accurately represented for future reference or processing.
