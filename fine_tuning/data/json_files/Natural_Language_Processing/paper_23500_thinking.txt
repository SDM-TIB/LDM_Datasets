To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CattleFace-RGBT: RGB-T Cattle Facial Landmark Benchmark" by Ethan Coffman et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** to identify any datasets that are introduced or referenced. The abstract mentions the **CattleFace-RGBT dataset**, which is a clear indication that this is a primary dataset of interest.

Next, I will move to the **introduction** section, where the authors discuss the limitations of existing datasets and introduce their own. They emphasize that the CattleFace-RGBT dataset is the first of its kind to include both RGB and thermal images for cattle, which reinforces its significance.

In the **Datasets section**, I will look for specific details about the CattleFace-RGBT dataset. The authors provide a comprehensive description, stating that it consists of **2,300 RGB-T image pairs**, totaling **4,600 images**, and includes **13 keypoint landmarks**. This section is crucial as it provides the necessary details about the dataset's composition and purpose.

I will also check the **Related Datasets** section, where the authors compare their dataset with existing ones. They mention several other datasets, such as **CattleEyeView**, which is relevant for context but not the primary focus of this extraction.

To ensure I have the correct citations, I will consult the **References section** of the paper. The authors reference the following datasets:

1. **CattleFace-RGBT Dataset**: This is the primary dataset introduced in the paper, and it does not have a separate citation since it is the authors' own work.

2. **CattleEyeView**: The citation for this dataset is:
   > Kian Eng Ong, Sivaji Retta, Ramarajulu Srinivasan, Shawn Tan, and Jun Liu. *CattleEyeView: A Multi-task Top-down View Cattle Dataset for Smarter Precision Livestock Farming*. In VCIP, 2023.

3. Other datasets mentioned in the paper, such as **Animal Pose**, **AnimalWeb**, and others, may also be relevant, but I will focus on those that are directly cited in the context of the CattleFace-RGBT dataset.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for any referenced datasets. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets discussed in the paper, particularly focusing on the CattleFace-RGBT dataset and its significance in the field of cattle welfare research.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring clarity and completeness for any downstream processing or review.
