To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Empirical Capacity Model for Self-Attention Neural Networks" by Aki Härmä et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on the memory capacity of transformer models, but it does not mention specific datasets.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (section 5) closely, as this is where datasets are typically discussed. In this section, the authors describe their methodology for measuring the capacity of transformer models using synthetic data. They mention two approaches: Maximum Library Size (MLS) and Maximum Attainable Capacity (MAC), but they do not refer to any real-world datasets. Instead, they use synthetic data derived from a knowledge base for their experiments.

Since the paper does not reference any specific datasets, I will check the **References section** to see if any cited works might include datasets relevant to their research. However, the references primarily consist of theoretical papers and studies on transformer models and their capacities, rather than datasets.

Given that the authors focus on synthetic data for their experiments, I will note that there are no publicly available datasets mentioned in this paper. Therefore, I will not be able to provide full citations for datasets as there are none to extract.

In summary, my findings indicate that this paper does not utilize any specific datasets, and the experiments are conducted using synthetic data. I will document this conclusion clearly, emphasizing the absence of datasets in the context of the research presented.
