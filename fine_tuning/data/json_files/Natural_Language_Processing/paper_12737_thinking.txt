To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Tiny LVLM-eHub: Early Multimodal Experiments with Bard" by Wenqi Shao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's focus on evaluating multimodal capabilities, which may hint at the datasets used for this evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly where the authors describe their evaluation framework. Here, they mention that they consolidated **42 standard text-related visual benchmarks** for their evaluation. This indicates that multiple datasets are involved, and I need to identify each one.

I will then look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any subsections that explicitly list the datasets used. In this paper, the authors mention specific datasets such as:

1. **ImageNetVC**: Used for evaluating visual commonsense knowledge.
2. **MSCOCO**: Utilized for assessing object hallucination.
3. **Virtual Home**: Employed for evaluating embodied intelligence.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access these datasets.

For **ImageNetVC**, the citation is:
> Heming Xia, Qingxiu Dong, Lei Li, Jingjing Xu, Ziwei Qin, and Zhifang Sui. *Imagenetvc: Zero-shot visual commonsense evaluation on 1000 imagenet categories*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2305.15028, 2023.

For **MSCOCO**, the citation is:
> Xinlei Chen, Hao Fang, Tsung-Yi Lin, Ramakrishna Vedantam, Saurabh Gupta, Piotr Dollár, and C Lawrence Zitnick. *Microsoft coco captions: Data collection and evaluation server*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1504.00325, 2015.

For **Virtual Home**, the citation is:
> Xavier Puig, Kevin Ra, Marko Boben, Jiaman Li, Tingwu Wang, Sanja Fidler, and Antonio Torralba. *Virtualhome: Simulating household activities via programs*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 8494–8502, 2018.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.

In summary, my steps included:
1. Reading through the abstract and methodology to identify datasets.
2. Listing the datasets mentioned in the paper.
3. Retrieving full citations from the references section for each dataset.
4. Compiling the information for structured output.
