To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Synthesis of Green Architectural Tactics for ML-Enabled Systems" by Heli Järvenpää et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions, but it may not explicitly mention datasets. The introduction may provide context or references to datasets used in the research.

Next, I will examine the **methodology and results sections**. These sections often contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used for analysis or validation. I will look for any specific datasets mentioned, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

I will also check the **tables and figures** throughout the paper, as datasets are sometimes summarized in these formats. If there are any tables listing datasets or figures that reference specific datasets, I will note those down.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access the datasets.

If the paper discusses datasets derived from other studies or papers, I will ensure to trace back to those original sources for accurate citations.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and accompanied by its full citation. This will include the dataset name, a brief description, and the citation formatted according to academic standards.

By following these steps, I will ensure a thorough and accurate extraction of datasets from the paper, maintaining the integrity of the citations.
