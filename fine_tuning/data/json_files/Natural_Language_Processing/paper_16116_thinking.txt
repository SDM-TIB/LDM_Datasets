To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Vision meets mmWave Radar: 3D Object Perception Benchmark for Autonomous Driving" by Yizhou Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract introduces the **CRUW3D dataset**, which is a key focus of the paper, indicating that it is likely the primary dataset discussed.

Next, I will look for specific details about the **CRUW3D dataset** in the **introduction** and **data collection** sections. The introduction states that the dataset includes 66K synchronized frames from camera, radar, and LiDAR, which provides a clear indication of its scope and purpose.

In the **data collection section**, the authors describe the dataset in detail, including its composition of synchronized camera RGB images, radar RF tensors, and LiDAR point clouds, along with annotations for 3D bounding boxes and trajectories. This confirms that the CRUW3D dataset is indeed the main dataset being utilized in their experiments.

I will also check the **experiments section** to see if the authors mention any other datasets used for comparison or validation. However, the focus remains on the CRUW3D dataset, which is highlighted as a novel contribution to the field.

Finally, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citation for the CRUW3D dataset. Since the dataset is introduced in this paper, I will cite it as follows:

- For the **CRUW3D dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yizhou Wang, Jen-Hao Cheng, Jui-Te Huang, Sheng-Yao Kuan, Qiqian Fu, Chiming Ni, Shengyu Hao, Gaoang Wang, Guanbin Xing, Hui Liu, Jenq-Neng Hwang. *Vision meets mmWave Radar: 3D Object Perception Benchmark for Autonomous Driving*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages XX-XX, 2023.

Now, I will compile the dataset entry for the CRUW3D dataset, ensuring to include all relevant details and the full citation. This will be structured according to the required format for downstream processing.
