To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Unlawful Proxy Discrimination: A Framework for Challenging Inherently Discriminatory Algorithms" by Hilde Weerts et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their full citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's focus, but I will need to delve deeper into the introduction and methodology for specific dataset references.

Next, I will examine **section 4 (Identifying Potential Inherent Direct Discrimination)**, as it discusses technical approaches and metrics that could be developed or applied. This section may contain references to datasets used for analysis or examples that illustrate the concepts discussed.

In **section 4.1.1 (Measuring Simple Proxy Capacity)**, the authors mention the **UCI Adult dataset** as an example for measuring proxy capacity. This dataset is derived from the US Census of 1994 and contains demographic information of individuals, which is relevant for the analysis of algorithmic discrimination.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the UCI Adult dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:
> Barry Becker and Ronny Kohavi. *Adult*. UCI Machine Learning Repository. https://doi.org/10.24432/C5XW20

Since the paper primarily discusses theoretical frameworks and does not explicitly mention multiple datasets, I will focus on the UCI Adult dataset as the primary dataset referenced.

Now, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring to include the full citation as required. 

After completing this process, I will have a structured output that includes the identified dataset and its citation, ready for further processing or review.
