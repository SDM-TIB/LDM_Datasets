To extract datasets from the research paper titled "FEDSTRUCT: Federated Decoupled Learning over Interconnected Graphs" by Javad Aliakbari et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. In the abstract, the authors mention validating their framework on **six datasets for semi-supervised node classification**. This indicates that there are multiple datasets involved, and I need to identify them.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (Section 7) where the authors provide details about the datasets used. Here, they explicitly list the datasets:

1. **Cora**: A citation network dataset with 2,708 nodes and 5,278 edges, used for node classification.
2. **Citeseer**: Another citation network dataset with 3,327 nodes and 4,676 edges.
3. **Pubmed**: A dataset consisting of 19,717 nodes and 44,327 edges, also for node classification.
4. **Chameleon**: A dataset with 2,277 nodes and 36,101 edges, known for its heterophilic nature.
5. **Amazon Photo**: A dataset with 7,650 nodes and 238,162 edges.
6. **Amazon Ratings**: A dataset with 24,492 nodes and 93,050 edges.

I will also check the **appendices** for any additional details regarding the datasets, such as their characteristics or specific references.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset from the **References section** of the paper. The citations are as follows:

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and cited according to the requirements.
