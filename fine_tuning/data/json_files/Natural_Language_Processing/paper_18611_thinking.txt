To extract datasets from the research paper titled "PiCO: Peer Review in LLMs based on the Consistency Optimization" by Kun-Peng Ning et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. In the abstract, the authors refer to "multiple datasets" used for experiments, which indicates that there are datasets to be extracted.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 3) where the authors detail the datasets used for validation. Here, they mention three specific datasets:

1. **Chatbot Arena**: This dataset is described as containing pairwise data from twenty LLMs with human preference annotations. It is used to evaluate real dialogue performance.

2. **MT-Bench**: This dataset assesses six LLMsâ€™ responses to 80 multi-category questions, providing a structured evaluation framework.

3. **AlpacaEval**: This dataset integrates evaluations from diverse tests to align evaluations with real-world interactions.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with sources for further exploration.

- For **Chatbot Arena**, the citation is:
  > Ziems, C., Held, W., Shaikh, O., Chen, J., Zhang, Z., & Yang, D. (2023). Can large language models transform computational social science? arXiv preprint arXiv:2305.03514.

- For **MT-Bench**, the citation is:
  > Zheng, L., Chiang, W.-L., Sheng, Y., Zhuang, S., Wu, Z., Zeng, A., Gonzalez, J. E., & Stoica, I. (2023). Judging llm-as-a-judge with mt-bench and chatbot arena. arXiv preprint arXiv:2306.05087.

- For **AlpacaEval**, the citation is:
  > Li, X., Zhang, T., Dubois, Y., Taori, R., Gulrajani, I., Guestrin, C., Liang, P., & Hashimoto, T. B. (2023). AlpacaEval: An automatic evaluator of instruction-following models. arXiv preprint arXiv:2305.14387.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant datasets and their sources from the paper.
