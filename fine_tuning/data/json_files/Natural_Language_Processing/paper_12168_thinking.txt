To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A testing-based approach to assess the clusterability of categorical data" by Lianyu Hu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, results, and methods sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions applying the method to a set of benchmark categorical datasets, which indicates that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **results section**, specifically subsection II.B, where the authors describe the datasets used for evaluation. They mention utilizing a selection of widely used categorical datasets from the **UCI repository**. This is a strong indication that I need to identify these datasets and their details.

In the **supplementary tables**, particularly Supplementary Table 1, the authors provide a comprehensive list of 18 UCI datasets, including their properties such as the number of objects, attributes, categories, and classes. This table is crucial for extracting the necessary information about each dataset.

The datasets listed in Supplementary Table 1 are:
