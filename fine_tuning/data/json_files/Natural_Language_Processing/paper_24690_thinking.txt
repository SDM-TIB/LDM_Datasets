To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning System Dynamics without Forgetting" by Xikun Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the construction of a "novel benchmark of biological dynamic systems," which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe the systems used for their experiments. In **subsection 4.1 (Experimental Systems)**, they mention two types of systems:

1. **Simulated Physics Systems**: These include spring connected particles and charged particles. The authors provide a detailed description of the configurations used for these systems, indicating that they have generated data from these simulations.

2. **Biological Cellular Systems**: The authors state that they constructed a benchmark based on the VCell platform, specifically mentioning two models: the EGFR receptor interaction model and the Ran protein-based translocation model. They indicate that they generated simulated data using the VCell platform.

In **subsection 4.1.1 (Physics System Sequence)**, the authors detail the configurations of the physics systems, which include various parameters such as the number of particles, box size, and interaction strength. This indicates that the datasets are derived from these configurations.

In **subsection 4.1.2 (Biological Cellular System)**, the authors describe the two types of cellular models and how they generated data using the VCell platform. They mention that they constructed multiple systems aligned into sequences for experiments.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned:

- For the **VCell platform**, the citation is:
  > J. Schaff, C. C. Fink, B. Slepchenko, J. H. Carson, and L. M. Loew. *A general computational framework for modeling cellular structure and function*. Biophysical journal, vol. 73, no. 3, pp. 1135â€“1146, 1997.

- For the **EGFR receptor interaction model** and **Ran protein-based translocation model**, the specific citations are not provided in the references, but they are based on the VCell platform, which is cited above.

Next, I will summarize the datasets extracted from the paper:

1. **Simulated Physics Systems**: Data generated from various configurations of spring connected particles and charged particles.
   - Citation: Not explicitly provided, but based on the methods described in the paper.

2. **Biological Cellular Systems**: Data generated from the EGFR receptor interaction model and the Ran protein-based translocation model using the VCell platform.
   - Citation: Schaff et al. (1997) as mentioned above.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for clarity and future reference.
