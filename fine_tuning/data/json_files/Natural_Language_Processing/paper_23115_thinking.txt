To extract datasets from the research paper titled "AdapNet: Adaptive Noise-Based Network for Low-Quality Image Retrieval" by Sihe Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors constructed two datasets with low-quality queries based on the standard Revisited Oxford and Revisited Paris datasets. This suggests that these datasets are crucial for the research.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for further details. The introduction discusses the challenges of image retrieval affected by noise and mentions the construction of noisy datasets from the original datasets, which reinforces the importance of the datasets used.

In the **methods section**, particularly in the subsection on datasets, the authors describe how they created two new noisy datasets: **Noise Revisited Oxford** and **Noise Revisited Paris**. They explain that these datasets were generated by applying various types of noise to the original Revisited Oxford and Revisited Paris datasets. This section will provide specific details about the datasets, including their purpose and how they were constructed.

I will also check the **experiments section** to confirm the datasets used for evaluation. The authors mention using the **GLDv2-clean** dataset for training and the **Noise Revisited Oxford** and **Noise Revisited Paris** datasets for testing. This confirms the datasets' relevance to the experiments conducted.

Now, I will gather the full citations for the datasets mentioned in the paper. The original datasets are:

1. **Revisited Oxford Dataset**:
   > Tobias Weyand, Andre Araujo, Bingyi Cao, and Jack Sim. *Google landmarks dataset v2-a large-scale benchmark for instance-level recognition and retrieval*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pages 2575–2584, 2020.

2. **Revisited Paris Dataset**:
   > Filip Radenović, Ahmet Iscen, Giorgos Tolias, Yannis Avrithis, and Ondřej Chum. *Revisiting oxford and paris: Large-scale image retrieval benchmarking*. In Proceedings of the IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pages 5706–5715, 2018.

3. **Noise Revisited Oxford Dataset**: This dataset is derived from the Revisited Oxford dataset, so I will reference the original citation.

4. **Noise Revisited Paris Dataset**: Similarly, this dataset is derived from the Revisited Paris dataset, so I will reference the original citation.

After compiling this information, I will summarize the datasets and their citations clearly, ensuring that I have accurately captured all necessary details for future reference or processing.
