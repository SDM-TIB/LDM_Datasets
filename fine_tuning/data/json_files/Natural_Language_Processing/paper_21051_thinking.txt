To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Equivariant Local Reference Frames for Unsupervised Non-rigid Point Cloud Shape Correspondence" by Ling Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to find any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the proposed method is evaluated on "three benchmarks," which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 5), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they provide a table (Table 1) that summarizes the datasets, including their categories, number of training and testing samples, and whether they are real or synthetic.

The datasets listed in the paper are:

1. **SURREAL Dataset**: A synthetic dataset generated from the SMPL human model, consisting of 230,000 shapes, with 1600 training and 400 validation samples.

2. **SHREC’19 Dataset**: A dataset containing 44 human shapes, with 1513 training and 379 validation samples.

3. **SMAL Dataset**: This dataset features parametric models of five different animals, with 8000 training and 2000 validation samples.

4. **TOSCA Dataset**: Generated from three base meshes (human, dog, and horse), with 286 test samples.
   - Citation: Bronstein, A.M., Bronstein, M.M., Kimmel, R. (2008). Numerical geometry of non-rigid shapes. Springer Science & Business Media.

5. **CAPE Dataset**: A real dataset consisting of 209 raw-scanned point cloud pairs of clothed humans.

6. **DeepDeform Dataset**: This dataset includes RGB-D frames of non-rigidly moving objects, with 50 animal and 35 human pairs used for evaluation.
   - Citation: Bozic, A., Zollhofer, M., Theobalt, C., Nießner, M. (2020). Deepdeform: Learning non-rigid RGB-D reconstruction with semi-supervised data. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pp. 7002–7012.

After identifying these datasets, I will ensure to compile the full citations for each dataset as they are crucial for proper referencing.

Finally, I will summarize the findings in a structured format that highlights each dataset along with its citation, ensuring clarity and completeness for future reference or processing.
