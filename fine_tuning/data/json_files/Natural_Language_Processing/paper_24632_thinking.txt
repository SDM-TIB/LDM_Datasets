To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Basketball-SORT: An Association Method for Complex Multi-object Occlusion Problems in Basketball Multi-object Tracking" by Qingrui Hu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the development of a method for multi-object tracking in basketball videos, which suggests that datasets related to basketball tracking might be discussed.

In the **introduction**, the authors reference various multi-object tracking datasets, specifically mentioning that they used the **basketball fixed camera dataset from the TeamTrack dataset** to validate their approach. This indicates that the TeamTrack dataset is a primary dataset for their experiments.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In **section 4.1 (Experimental setup)**, the authors provide details about the basketball fixed camera videos from the TeamTrack dataset. They describe it as containing videos filmed from a side view using a fish-eye camera, segmented into 30-second intervals, with labeled players and referees.

Now, I will gather the full citation for the TeamTrack dataset from the **References section**. The citation is as follows:
> Scott, A., Uchida, I., Ding, N., Umemoto, R., Bunker, R., Kobayashi, R., Koyama, T., Onishi, M., Kameda, Y., Fujii, K. (2024). *Teamtrack: A dataset for multi-sport multi-object tracking in full-pitch videos*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition.

Since the authors specifically mention using the basketball fixed camera dataset from the TeamTrack dataset, I will ensure to note that this dataset is used for their experiments.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the TeamTrack dataset as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research.
