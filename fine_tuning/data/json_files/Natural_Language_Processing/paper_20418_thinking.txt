To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Probabilistic World Modeling with Asymmetric Distance Measure" by Meng Song, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract does not explicitly mention any datasets, but it does refer to evaluations in gridworld environments, which may imply the use of specific datasets.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section 7) closely, as this is where datasets are typically described. In this section, the authors mention that they evaluate their method in five gridworld environments: **Four Rooms**, **Dumbbell**, **Wide Door**, **Flask**, and **Nail**. Each of these environments is described as a gridworld setup, but I need to confirm if they are publicly available datasets or if they are custom environments created for the study.

I will also check the **references section** to see if any of these environments are cited or if there are any references to datasets used in the experiments. If the environments are not standard datasets, I will note that they are custom environments created for the purpose of this research.

After reviewing the paper, I find that the environments are indeed custom setups designed for the experiments, and there are no external datasets cited for these environments. Therefore, I will summarize the information as follows:

1. **Four Rooms**: A custom gridworld environment designed for the experiments.
2. **Dumbbell**: Another custom gridworld environment used for evaluation.
3. **Wide Door**: A custom gridworld environment created for the study.
4. **Flask**: A custom gridworld environment utilized in the experiments.
5. **Nail**: A custom gridworld environment included in the evaluation.

Since these environments are not publicly available datasets and are not cited in the references, I will note that they are custom environments created for this research.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring to include the details about the custom nature of the environments and the lack of external citations. This will provide a clear understanding of the datasets used in the study.
