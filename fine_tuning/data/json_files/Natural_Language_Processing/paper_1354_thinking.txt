To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Word Sense Disambiguation for 158 Languages using Word Embeddings Only" by Varvara Logacheva et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the datasets discussed. The abstract mentions that the authors induced a collection of sense inventories for 158 languages based on pre-trained fastText word embeddings. This indicates that there may be datasets related to these embeddings.

Next, I will look for specific sections that typically contain dataset information, such as **section 4 (System Design)** and **section 5 (Evaluation)**. In these sections, the authors describe the construction of sense inventories and the evaluation of their system, which may include references to datasets used for training or evaluation.

In **section 4.1 (Construction of Sense Inventories)**, the authors mention that they constructed word sense inventories for 158 languages based on fastText embeddings. They also refer to the **SemR-11 datasets** used for evaluating lexical similarity and relatedness tasks. This is a clear indication of a dataset that I need to document.

In **section 5.1 (Lexical Similarity and Relatedness)**, the authors specify that they used the **SemR-11 datasets** for their evaluation, which contains word pairs with manually assigned similarity scores for 12 languages. This dataset is crucial for understanding the performance of their method.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the **SemR-11 datasets**. The citation is as follows:
> Barzegar, S., Davis, B., Zarrouk, M., Handschuh, S., and Freitas, A. (2018). SemR-11: A Multi-Lingual Gold-Standard for Semantic Similarity and Relatedness for Eleven Languages. In Proceedings of the Eleventh International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC 2018), pages 3912–3916, Miyazaki, Japan. European Language Resources Association (ELRA).

Additionally, I will note that the authors mention the use of **fastText embeddings** created by Grave et al. (2018) as a resource for their work. The citation for this dataset is:
> Grave, E., Bojanowski, P., Gupta, P., Joulin, A., and Mikolov, T. (2018). Learning Word Vectors for 157 Languages. In Proceedings of the Eleventh International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC 2018), pages 3483–3487, Miyazaki, Japan. European Language Resources Association (ELRA).

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
