To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Hybrid Improved Document-level Embedding (HIDE)" by Satanik Mitra and Mamata Jenamani, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors tested their method on **six different datasets**, which indicates that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. In **subsection 4.1 (Description of Datasets)**, they list the datasets as follows:

1. **MR (Movie Review Dataset)**: This dataset contains 1000 positive and 1000 negative movie reviews categorized based on star ratings. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Pang, B., & Lee, L. (2005). Seeing stars: Exploiting class relationships for sentiment categorization with respect to rating scales. In ACL-05 - 43rd Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, Proceedings of the Conference (pp. 115–124).

2. **CR (Customer Review Dataset)**: This dataset contains reviews of 14 different products, labeled as positive and negative. The citation is:
   > Hu, M., & Liu, B. (2004). Mining and summarizing customer reviews. In KDD-2004 - Proceedings of the Tenth ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (Vol. 368, pp. 168–177).

3. **RT (Rotten Tomatoes Dataset)**: This dataset consists of 5331 positive and 5331 negative reviews. The citation is:
   > Pang, B., & Lee, L. (2005). Seeing stars: Exploiting class relationships for sentiment categorization with respect to rating scales. In ACL-05 - 43rd Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, Proceedings of the Conference (pp. 115–124).

4. **SST (Stanford Sentiment Treebank)**: This dataset includes 11,855 sentences labeled as positive and negative. The citation is:
   > Socher, R., Perelygin, A., Wu, J. Y., Chuang, J., Manning, C. D., Ng, A. Y., & Potts, C. (2013). Recursive deep models for semantic compositionality over a sentiment treebank. In EMNLP 2013 - 2013 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, Proceedings of the Conference (pp. 1631–1642).

5. **SST-1**: Similar to SST, this dataset has train, test, and dev splits with fine-grained labels. The citation is:
   > Socher, R., Perelygin, A., Wu, J. Y., Chuang, J., Manning, C. D., Ng, A. Y., & Potts, C. (2013). Recursive deep models for semantic compositionality over a sentiment treebank. In EMNLP 2013 - 2013 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, Proceedings of the Conference (pp. 1631–1642).

6. **Amazon Review Dataset (ARD)**: This dataset contains 14.2 million entries, which are labeled based on star ratings. The citation is:
   > He, R., & McAuley, J. (2016). Ups and downs: Modeling the visual evolution of fashion trends with one-class collaborative filtering. In 25th International World Wide Web Conference, WWW 2016 (pp. 507–517).

After identifying these datasets and their citations, I will ensure that I have accurately noted the details and citations for each dataset.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation.
