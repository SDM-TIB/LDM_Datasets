To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Exploring Data-Driven Chemical SMILES Tokenization Approaches to Identify Key Protein-Ligand Binding Moieties" by Asu Busra Temizer et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's goals and methods, which may hint at the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the significance of machine learning in drug discovery and the need for chemical vocabularies, but I need to look for specific datasets.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Materials and Methods)**, particularly **subsection 2.4 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used in their study. Here, they mention three datasets:

1. **BDB Dataset**: Contains affinity information for 31,000 interactions involving 924 compounds and 490 proteins from 81 protein families. The dataset reports protein-compound affinities in terms of pKd.

2. **LIT-PCBA**: Includes 15 target proteins and 7844 active and 407,381 inactive compounds, specifically curated for virtual screening and machine learning.

3. **ProtBENCH**: Contains protein family-specific bioactivity datasets, with interactions belonging to various protein superfamilies, including varying sizes in terms of interactions, proteins, and compounds.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and further exploration.

- For the **BDB dataset**, the citation is:
  > Rıza Özçelik, Alperen Bağ, Berk Atıl, Arzucan Özgür, and Elif Özkırımlı. *Chemboost: A chemical language based approach for protein–ligand binding affinity prediction*. Molecular Informatics, 40(5):2000212, 2021.

- For the **LIT-PCBA dataset**, the citation is:
  > Viet-Khoa Tran-Nguyen, Célien Jacquemard, and Didier Rognan. *LIT-PCBA: An unbiased data set for machine learning and virtual screening*. Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling, 60(9):4263–4273, 2020. doi:10.1021/acs.jcim.0c00155.

- For the **ProtBENCH dataset**, the citation is:
  > Heval Atas Guvenilir and Tunca Doğan. *How to approach machine learning-based prediction of drug/compound–target interactions*. Journal of Cheminformatics, 15(1):1–36, 2023.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This step-by-step approach ensures that I accurately capture the datasets and their relevant citations from the research paper.
