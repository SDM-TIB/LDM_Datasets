To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The Expressive Capacity of State Space Models: A Formal Language Perspective" by Yash Sarrof, Yana Veitsman, and Michael Hahn, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a general overview, but the introduction often contains specific references to datasets used in the research.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets or experiments**. In this paper, the authors discuss various languages and their modeling capabilities, but I need to confirm if they explicitly mention any datasets used for empirical validation.

Upon reviewing the **experiments section**, I find that the authors mention using datasets from Bhattamishra et al. (2020) for testing their theoretical results. They specifically refer to a test suite that includes various formal languages, which suggests that the datasets are derived from this suite.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper cites Bhattamishra et al. (2020) for the test suite, which is crucial for my dataset extraction.

The citation for the dataset is:
> Bhattamishra, S., Ahuja, K., & Goyal, N. (2020). On the ability and limitations of transformers to recognize formal languages. In Proceedings of the 2020 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), pages 7096â€“7116.

Additionally, the authors mention using the dataset released by Liu et al. (2023) for the Flip-Flop language, which is another dataset I need to include.

The citation for this dataset is:
> Liu, B., Ash, J. T., Goel, S., Krishnamurthy, A., & Zhang, C. (2023). Exposing attention glitches with flip-flop language modeling. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 36: Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems 2023, NeurIPS 2023, New Orleans, LA, USA, December 10 - 16, 2023.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
