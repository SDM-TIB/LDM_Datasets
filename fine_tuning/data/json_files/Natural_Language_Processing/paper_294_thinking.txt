To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Exploring Fine-Tuned Embeddings that Model Intensifiers for Emotion Analysis" by Laura Bostan and Roman Klinger, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their methods against a "crowd-sourced corpus of intensity annotations for tweets," suggesting that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Methods)**, specifically **subsection 3.1 (Data Collection and Annotation)**, where the authors describe how they created their dataset. They mention that they collected tweets containing combinations of adjectives and degree adverbs (intensifiers) and filtered these to create a dataset of 266 phrases. This indicates that the dataset is based on Twitter data.

In this section, the authors also state that they obtained a set of 32 million tweets from Twitter's official API, which they filtered based on specific criteria. This large corpus is crucial for understanding the dataset's context.

Additionally, they mention a crowdsourcing experiment to collect scores for different combinations of degree adverbs and emotion adjectives, which they make publicly available. This suggests that there is a specific dataset created from this crowdsourcing effort.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The authors refer to their dataset as a "crowdsourced corpus of intensity annotations for tweets," and they provide a link to access this data: https://www.ims.uni-stuttgart.de/data/modifieremotion.dictionary-online/. However, they do not provide a formal citation for this dataset in the references.

Since the dataset is based on Twitter data, I will also note that the original source of the tweets is Twitter itself, but there is no specific citation for the Twitter API in the references.

To summarize, I will extract the following datasets:

1. **Crowdsourced Emotion Intensity Dataset**: This dataset consists of intensity annotations for tweets containing combinations of adjectives and degree adverbs. The dataset is publicly available at the provided link.

2. **Twitter Corpus**: A large corpus of 32 million tweets collected from Twitter's official API, which serves as the basis for the analysis in the paper.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations, ensuring that I include the necessary details for each dataset.
