To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Sample Rate Independent Recurrent Neural Networks for Audio Effects Processing" by Alistair Carson et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and evaluation sections** to look for any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research but may not explicitly mention datasets. However, it does mention the evaluation of methods on neural network models, which could imply the use of datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors discuss virtual analog modeling and the use of neural networks. This section may provide context for the datasets used in their experiments, but I will need to look for specific mentions of datasets.

In the **methods section**, the authors describe the approaches they used for sample rate modification. They mention evaluating their methods on "several neural network models of guitar amplifiers and effects pedals." This suggests that there are datasets related to these models, but I need to find specific names or references.

Moving to the **evaluation section**, the authors state that they tested their methods on "18 pre-trained LSTM networks found in the GuitarML Tone Library." This is a clear indication of a dataset being used, and I will need to document this dataset.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the GuitarML Tone Library, as it is crucial to provide proper attribution for the dataset used in the experiments. The citation for the GuitarML Tone Library is:
> GuitarML Tone Library. Available at: https://guitarml.com/tonelibrary/tonelib-pro.html

Additionally, I will look for any other datasets mentioned in the paper, such as those used for training or testing the neural networks. If the authors refer to any specific datasets or provide citations for them, I will document those as well.

After gathering all the relevant information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This will ensure that the datasets are properly attributed and can be referenced in future work.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for easy review and processing.
