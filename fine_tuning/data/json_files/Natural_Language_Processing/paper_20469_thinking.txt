To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Equity through Access: A Case for Small-scale Deep Learning" by Raghavendra Selvan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors used **three medical image datasets** for their experiments, which is a clear indication that I need to find out more about these datasets.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Data & Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention:

1. **Derma Dataset**: This dataset is derived from the MedMNIST+ benchmark and consists of 7,007 training images, 1,003 validation images, and 2,005 test images. It contains seven target classes.

2. **LIDC Dataset**: This dataset is derived from the LIDC-IDRI dataset and includes 9,057 training images, 3,019 validation images, and 3,020 test images. It is used for lung image classification.

3. **Pneumonia Dataset**: Also derived from the MedMNIST+ benchmark, this dataset contains 4,708 training images, 524 validation images, and 624 test images. It is used for pneumonia classification.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **MedMNIST+ benchmark**, the citation is:
  > Yang, J., Shi, R., Wei, D., Liu, Z., Zhao, L., Ke, B., Pfister, H., Ni, B. (2023). *MedMNIST v2 - A large-scale lightweight benchmark for 2D and 3D biomedical image classification*. Scientific Data.

- For the **LIDC-IDRI dataset**, the citation is:
  > Armato III, S.G., McLennan, G., McNitt-Gray, M.F., Meyer, C.R., Yankelevitz, D., Aberle, D.R., Henschke, C.I., Hoffman, E.A., Kazerooni, E.A., MacMahon, H., et al. (2004). *Lung image database consortium: developing a resource for the medical imaging research community*. Radiology.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This includes ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation.
