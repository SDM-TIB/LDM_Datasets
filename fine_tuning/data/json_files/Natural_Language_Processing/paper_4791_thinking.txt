To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MuVER: Improving First-Stage Entity Retrieval with Multi-View Entity Representations" by Xinyin Ma et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the method achieves state-of-the-art performance on **ZESHEL** and improves quality on three standard Entity Linking datasets. This indicates that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 3) where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for evaluation. In **section 3.1**, they mention evaluating MuVER under two different knowledge bases: **Wikia** and **Wikipedia**. They specifically highlight four datasets:

1. **AIDA-CoNLL**: This dataset is used as an in-domain dataset for entity linking.
2. **WNED-WIKI**: This is one of the out-of-domain datasets used for validation.
3. **MSNBC**: Another out-of-domain dataset included in the evaluation.
4. **ZESHEL**: A zero-shot entity linking dataset that emphasizes understanding unstructured descriptions.

I will then check the **appendix** for any additional details or statistics regarding these datasets, which may provide further context or specifics about their usage.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset from the **References section** of the paper:

- For **AIDA-CoNLL**, the citation is:

- For **WNED-WIKI**, the citation is:

- For **MSNBC**, the citation is:
  > Silviu Cucerzan. *Large-scale named entity disambiguation based on Wikipedia data*. In EMNLP-CoNLL 2007, Proceedings of the 2007 Joint Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing and Computational Natural Language Learning, June 28-30, 2007, Prague, Czech Republic, pages 708–716. ACL.

- For **ZESHEL**, the citation is:
  > Lajanugen Logeswaran, Ming-Wei Chang, Kenton Lee, Kristina Toutanova, Jacob Devlin, and Honglak Lee. *Zero-shot entity linking by reading entity descriptions*.

Association for Computational Linguistics.

After compiling this information, I will create structured entries for each dataset, ensuring that the full citations are included for reference. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research.
