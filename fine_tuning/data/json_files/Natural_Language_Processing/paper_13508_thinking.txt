To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Cyberbullying Detection for Low-resource Languages and Dialects: Review of the State of the Art" by Tanjim Mahmud et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets mentioned in the paper, along with their full citations.

1. **Initial Reading**: I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are mentioned or implied. The abstract discusses the creation of a cyberbullying dataset in the Chittagonian dialect of Bangla, which indicates that there is at least one dataset to extract.

2. **Identifying Sections**: Next, I will look for specific sections that typically contain dataset information, such as **Methodology**, **Experiments**, or any dedicated **Datasets** section. In this paper, the authors mention the creation of a dataset in the Chittagonian dialect of Bangla, which is likely detailed in the methodology or results sections.

3. **Extracting Dataset Information**: In the **Methodology** section, I will look for details about the dataset, including:
   - The name of the dataset: "Cyberbullying dataset in the Chittagonian dialect of Bangla."
   - The size of the dataset: 5,100 comments/posts collected from various social media platforms.
   - The categories used for annotation: Bullying and Not Bullying.

4. **Full Citation**: I will then check the **References** section to find the full citation for the dataset. Since the dataset is newly created by the authors, it may not have a separate citation but will be referenced in the context of their work. I will note that the dataset is part of their research contribution.

5. **Compiling Information**: I will compile the extracted information into a structured format, ensuring that I include:
   - The dataset name.
   - A brief description of the dataset, including its purpose and the languages involved.
   - The full citation of the paper as the source of the dataset.

6. **Final Review**: Finally, I will review the entire paper to ensure that I have not missed any other datasets that may be mentioned in passing or in the context of other studies referenced by the authors.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and cite the datasets from the paper, which is crucial for proper attribution and further research.
