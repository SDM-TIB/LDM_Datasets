To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MIS-AVoiDD: Modality Invariant and Specific Representation for Audio-Visual Deepfake Detection" by Vinaya Sree Katamneni and Ajita Rattani, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on **FakeAVCeleb** and **KoDF** datasets, which suggests these are the primary datasets used in their research.

Next, I will look for specific details about these datasets in the **experiments section**. In this section, the authors provide descriptions of both datasets:

1. **FakeAVCeleb**: This dataset is described as a collection of videos featuring audio and video manipulations of celebrities, generated using various deepfake techniques. It is well-balanced and annotated in terms of gender, race, geography, and types of manipulations, making it suitable for training deep learning models.

2. **KoDF**: This dataset consists of synthetic and real videos of Korean celebrities, generated using various deepfake techniques. It includes both real and fake videos, but only real audio, and is used for cross-dataset evaluation.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **FakeAVCeleb**, the citation is:
  > Hasam Khalid, Shahroz Tariq, and Simon S. Woo. *FakeAVCeleb: A novel audio-video multimodal deepfake dataset*. CoRR, vol. abs/2108.05080, 2021.

- For **KoDF**, the citation is:
  > Patrick Kwon, Jaeseong You, Gyuhyeon Nam, Sungwoo Park, and Gyeongsu Chae. *KoDF: A large-scale Korean deepfake detection dataset*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), October 2021, pp. 10744â€“10753.

With this information, I can now summarize the datasets extracted from the paper, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and concise overview of the datasets utilized in the research.
