To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ECR-Chain: Advancing Generative Language Models to Better Emotion-Cause Reasoners through Reasoning Chains" by Zhaopei Huang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to find any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the introduction of a new benchmark dataset called **"RECCON"**, which is a strong indicator that a dataset is being discussed.

Next, I will look for specific sections that detail the datasets used in the experiments. In the **experiments section**, the authors describe the **RECCON-DD dataset**, which supplements causal utterance annotations for each non-neutral utterance in the conversations of the **DailyDialog dataset**. This indicates that both datasets are relevant to the research.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **RECCON dataset**, the citation is:
   > Poria, S., Majumder, N., Hazarika, D., Ghosal, D., Bhardwaj, R., Yu Bai Jian, S., Hong, P., Ghosh, R., Roy, A., Chhaya, N., et al. (2021). Recognizing emotion cause in conversations. *Cognitive Computation*, 13(6), 1317-1332.

2. For the **DailyDialog dataset**, the citation is:
   > Li, Y., Su, H., Shen, X., Li, W., Cao, Z., & Niu, S. (2017). DailyDialog: A manually labelled multi-turn dialogue dataset. In *Proceedings of the Eighth International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing (Volume 1: Long Papers)*, pages 986-995.

Now, I will summarize the datasets identified:

- **RECCON Dataset**: This dataset is specifically designed for the task of recognizing emotion causes in conversations, providing annotations for causal utterances.
- **DailyDialog Dataset**: A dataset that contains multi-turn dialogues, which serves as the foundation for the RECCON dataset.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries with their full citations, ensuring that each dataset is clearly documented for future reference or processing.
