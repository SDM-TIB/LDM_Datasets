To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Inertia Adequacy in Transient Stability Models for Synthetic Electric Grids" by Adam Birchfield, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the paper presents a **7000-bus synthetic dataset** for research purposes, which is a strong indication that a dataset is available.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** and **section III (Designing Synthetic Datasets with Appropriate Inertia Parameters)**. In these sections, the author discusses the creation of synthetic dynamics cases and mentions the **Texas7000** dataset specifically. This dataset is described as a synthetic grid that reflects modern large-scale bulk electric grid dynamics.

In **section V (Summary and Future Work)**, the author reiterates the importance of the synthetic dataset and mentions that it is publicly available. This confirms that the dataset is intended for broader research use.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Texas7000 dataset. The paper references a repository where the dataset can be accessed:

- For the **Texas7000 dataset**, the citation is:
  > Texas A&M University. Electric grid test case repository. [Online]. Available: https://electricgrids.engr.tamu.edu/

Since the dataset is synthetic and does not represent an actual grid, the citation reflects its origin and availability rather than a traditional academic reference.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry for the Texas7000 dataset, ensuring that I include the full citation as required. This will provide a clear and complete reference for anyone interested in utilizing the dataset for their research.

After completing these steps, I will prepare the dataset entry for review or further processing.
