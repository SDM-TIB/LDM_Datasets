To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Uncovering Market Disorder and Liquidity Trends Detection" by Etienne Chevalier, Yadh Hafsi, and Vathana Ly Vath, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the use of "real market data analyses," which suggests that specific datasets are utilized in the study.

Next, I will focus on the **data description section (4.1)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the datasets used. Here, they mention the use of **Refinitiv limit order book tick-by-tick data** for BNP Paribas stock from **01/01/2022 to 31/12/2022**. This dataset is crucial as it provides the necessary data for their analysis of liquidity and market trends.

Additionally, the authors refer to the **VSTOXX® Volatility Index** as a tool for assessing price dynamics and liquidity, which is also relevant to their study but does not constitute a dataset in the same sense as the limit order book data.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the datasets mentioned. The paper does not provide a formal citation for the Refinitiv dataset, as it is proprietary data. However, I will note that the authors have used this dataset for their analysis.

For the VSTOXX® Volatility Index, I will look for its citation in the references. The authors do not provide a specific citation for this index either, but it is a well-known financial index published by the **Eurex Exchange**.

In summary, I will document the following datasets:

1. **Refinitiv Limit Order Book Tick-by-Tick Data**: This dataset includes detailed trading information for BNP Paribas stock from January 1, 2022, to December 31, 2022. While there is no formal citation provided, it is acknowledged as proprietary data from Refinitiv.

2. **VSTOXX® Volatility Index**: This index is used to assess market volatility and liquidity but is not cited in the paper. It is published by the Eurex Exchange.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and future reference.
