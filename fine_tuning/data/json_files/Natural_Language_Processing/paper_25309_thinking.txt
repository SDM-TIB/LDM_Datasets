To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Quantifying Distribution System Resilience from Utility Data: Large Event Risk and Benefits of Investments" by Arslan Ahmad and Ian Dobson, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors focus on historical outage data collected by utilities, which suggests that there is a dataset involved.

Next, I will examine the **section titled "Outage Data and Extracting Events"** where the authors describe the dataset in detail. They mention using six years of detailed outage data from a US distribution utility, which contains records of 32,278 individual power outages. This section provides specific information about the dataset, including the number of outages, the type of data collected (e.g., number of customers affected, outage start and end times, cause codes), and the exclusion of scheduled outages.

Additionally, I will look for any references to other datasets used in the analysis, such as the **NOAA weather data** mentioned for conducting wind resilience investments analysis. The authors state that they use weather data from the closest available weather station for each outage, which indicates another dataset involved in their research.

In the **results section**, the authors present findings based on the analysis of the outage data, which further confirms the importance of the dataset in their study.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. For the **outage data**, since it is specific to a US distribution utility and not a publicly available dataset, I will note it as:
   > Ahmad, A., & Dobson, I. (2024). Quantifying Distribution System Resilience from Utility Data: Large Event Risk and Benefits of Investments. Author Preprint.

2. For the **NOAA weather data**, while the paper does not provide a specific citation, I can reference NOAA as a source:
   > National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). (n.d.). Weather Data. Retrieved from [NOAA website URL].

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations. This will ensure that all relevant datasets are properly documented for future reference or analysis.
