To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Optimal Synthesis of Finite State Machines with Universal Gates using Evolutionary Algorithm" by Noor Ullah et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the use of **MCNC91 benchmark circuits**, which indicates that there is a dataset involved.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experimental setup** section. Here, the authors describe the use of **six MCNC91 benchmark FSMs** and **four custom-made Moore type sequence detectors** for their experiments. This suggests that these benchmarks are the datasets being utilized.

I will then check the **results section** to confirm the datasets used in the experiments. The authors provide comparisons of the performance of their method on the MCNC91 benchmark FSMs and the custom-made sequence detectors, which reinforces that these are the datasets of interest.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The MCNC benchmark circuits are commonly referenced in literature, so I will look for a standard citation for these benchmarks.

The citation for the MCNC benchmark circuits is:
> "MCNC Benchmark Circuits." *MCNC*, 1991. Available at: [http://www.mcnc.org](http://www.mcnc.org).

For the custom-made Moore type sequence detectors, since they are likely original to this paper, I will note that they do not have a separate citation but are part of the authors' experimental design.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for the MCNC benchmark circuits and noting the custom-made sequence detectors as part of the authors' work.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited.
