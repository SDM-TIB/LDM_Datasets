To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Spectral Representation for Causal Estimation with Hidden Confounders" by Tongzheng Ren et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors provide experimental validation on various settings, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this section, the authors explicitly state that they conduct experiments on two datasets: 

1. **dSprites Dataset**: This dataset is described as comprising images determined by five latent parameters (shape, scale, rotation, posX, posY). Each image has dimensions of 64 × 64 pixels and serves as the treatment variable X.

2. **Demand Design Dataset**: This is a synthetic benchmark for nonlinear IV regression, where the objective is to predict ticket demands based on ticket price, price sensitivity, and year time, with additional unobservable confounders.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For the **dSprites Dataset**, the citation is:
> Matthey, L., Higgins, I., Hassabis, D., & Lerchner, A. (2017). *dsprites: Disentanglement testing sprites dataset*. Retrieved from https://github.com/deepmind/dsprites-dataset/.

For the **Demand Design Dataset**, the citation is:
> Hartford, J., Lewis, G., Leyton-Brown, K., & Taddy, M. (2017). *Deep IV: A flexible approach for counterfactual prediction*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML), pages 1414–1423.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or processing. This includes ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation for proper referencing.
