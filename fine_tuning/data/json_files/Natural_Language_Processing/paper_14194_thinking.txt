To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DeepMesh: Mesh-based Cardiac Motion Tracking using Deep Learning" by Qingjie Meng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the proposed method is evaluated on CMR images acquired from the **UK Biobank**, which indicates that this is a significant dataset used in the research.

Next, I will look for specific sections that detail the datasets used, particularly the **experiments** section. In this section, the authors describe their experimental setup and mention that they performed experiments on **530 subjects from the UK Biobank study**. This confirms the dataset's relevance and usage in their experiments.

I will also check the **methodology** section to see if there are any additional datasets mentioned or if there are specific details about how the UK Biobank data was utilized. The paper states that each subject contains **SAX, 2CH, and 4CH view cine CMR sequences**, which provides more context about the type of data included in the UK Biobank dataset.

Now, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citation for the UK Biobank dataset. The citation for the UK Biobank is as follows:
> Petersen, S. E., Matthews, P. M., Francis, J. M., Robson, M. D., Zemrak, F., Boubertakh, R., Young, A. A., Hudson, S. R., Weale, P., Garratt, S., Collins, R., Piechnik, S. K., & Neubauer, S. (2015). UK Biobankâ€™s cardiovascular magnetic resonance protocol. *Journal of Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance*, 18, 8.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry for the UK Biobank into the required format, ensuring that the citation is included accurately.

In summary, the key steps I took were:
1. Read the abstract and introduction to identify the primary dataset.
2. Review the experiments section for details on the dataset's usage.
3. Check the methodology for additional context on the dataset.
4. Locate the full citation in the references section.

Now, I will prepare the dataset entry based on this information.
