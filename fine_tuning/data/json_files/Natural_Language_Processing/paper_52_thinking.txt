To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Word representation or word embedding in Persian texts" by Siamak Sarmady and Erfan Rahmani, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of several corpora for training neural networks, which indicates that datasets are present.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of processing Persian text and mention the need for effective word representation methods. They hint at the datasets used but do not provide specific names yet.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Corpuses and preprocessing)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used in their research:

1. **Bijankhan Corpus**: This corpus is referenced as a significant resource for Persian language processing. It is mentioned that it is available in LBL format, containing words and their tags.

2. **Hamshahri Corpus**: This corpus consists of 39,411 documents available in HTML format, which the authors processed for their research.

3. **UPEC Corpus**: The authors describe this corpus as having specific rules for whitespace and pseudo-space, which are crucial for the processing of Persian text.

In the **conclusion**, the authors summarize the use of these three corpora in generating word vectors, confirming their importance in the study.

Now, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for each of these datasets:

- For the **Bijankhan Corpus**, the citation is:
  > Bijankhan, M. (2004). The role of the corpus in writing a grammar: An introduction to a software. *Iranian Journal of Linguistics*, 19(2).

- For the **Hamshahri Corpus**, the citation is:
  > AleAhmad, A., et al. (2009). Hamshahri: A standard Persian text collection. *Knowledge-Based Systems*, 22(5), 382-387.

- For the **UPEC Corpus**, the citation is:
  > Seraji, M., Megyesi, B., & Nivre, J. (2012). A basic language resource kit for Persian. In *Proceedings of the Eighth International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC 2012)*, 23-25 May 2012, Istanbul, Turkey. European Language Resources Association.

Having gathered all the necessary information, I will now prepare to compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its full citation for future reference or processing.
