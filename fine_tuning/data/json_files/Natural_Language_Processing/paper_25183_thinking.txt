To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Stepwise Verification and Remediation of Student Reasoning Errors with Large Language Model Tutors" by Manu Kapur et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors collected a dataset of **1K stepwise math reasoning chains** with the first error step annotated by teachers. This indicates that a dataset is indeed present.

Next, I will look for specific details about the dataset in the **data collection section**. Here, the authors describe how they extended the **MathDial dataset** by having teachers annotate incorrect student solutions with their first error step. They mention that the dataset consists of **1,002 data points** with **612 unique math problems**. This provides a clear description of the dataset's size and content.

The authors also reference the **GSM8k dataset** as the source of the multi-step math word problems used in their study. This is another dataset that needs to be cited.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper from the **References section**:

1. For the **MathDial dataset**, the citation is:
   > Jakub Macina, Nico Daheim, Sankalan Chowdhury, Tanmay Sinha, Manu Kapur, Iryna Gurevych, and Mrinmaya Sachan. *MathDial: A dialogue tutoring dataset with rich pedagogical properties grounded in math reasoning problems*. In Findings of the Association for Computational Linguistics: EMNLP 2023, pages 5602â€“5621, Singapore. Association for Computational Linguistics.

2. For the **GSM8k dataset**, the citation is:
   > Karl Cobbe, Vineet Kosaraju, Mohammad Bavarian, Mark Chen, Heewoo Jun, Lukasz Kaiser, Matthias Plappert, Jerry Tworek, Jacob Hilton, Reiichiro Nakano, et al. *Training verifiers to solve math word problems*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2110.14168, 2021.

After compiling this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for review, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited.
