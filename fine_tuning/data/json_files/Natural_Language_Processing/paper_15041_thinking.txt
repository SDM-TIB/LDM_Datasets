To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Watermarking LLMs with Weight Quantization" by Linyang Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's focus, but the details about datasets are likely to be found in the experiments section.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe their experimental setup. In this section, they mention the datasets used for tuning the LLMs. Specifically, they state that they collected open-source datasets for their experiments. 

I will note the following datasets mentioned in the paper:

1. **SQuAD Dataset**: This dataset is referenced as a subset used in the trigger dataset construction. It is known for its question-answering tasks.

2. **PubMed Dataset**: This dataset is mentioned as part of the general dataset construction, which is used for biomedical research question answering.

3. **WritingPrompts Dataset**: This dataset is also included in the general dataset construction, which is used for story generation tasks.

4. **DetectGPT Dataset**: This dataset is referenced multiple times, indicating that it was used in both the trigger dataset construction and general dataset construction.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for each of these datasets:

- For the **SQuAD Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Pranav Rajpurkar, Jian Zhang, Konstantin Lopyrev, and Percy Liang. *SQuAD: 100,000+ questions for machine comprehension of text*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.05250, 2016.

- For the **PubMed Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Qiao Jin, Bhuwan Dhingra, Zhengping Liu, William Cohen, and Xinghua Lu. *PubMedQA: A dataset for biomedical research question answering*. In Proceedings of the 2019 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing and the 9th International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing (EMNLP-IJCNLP), pages 2567â€“2577, Hong Kong, China, 2019.

- For the **WritingPrompts Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Angela Fan, Mike Lewis, and Yann Dauphin. *Hierarchical neural story generation*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1805.04833, 2018.

- For the **DetectGPT Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Eric Mitchell, Yoonho Lee, Alexander Khazatsky, Christopher D. Manning, and Chelsea Finn. *DetectGPT: Zero-shot machine-generated text detection using probability curvature*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2301.11305, 2023.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and that the full citations are included. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
