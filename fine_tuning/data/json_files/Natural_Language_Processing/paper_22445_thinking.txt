To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ACTION: Augmentation and Computation Toolbox for Brain Network Analysis with Functional MRI" by Yuqi Fang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the toolbox utilizes **3,800+ resting-state fMRI scans** for model pretraining, which indicates that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will examine **section 3.1.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they mention the **NYU dataset**, which consists of 50 patients diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and 50 healthy controls (HCs). This section provides specific details about the dataset, including its purpose for model evaluation.

Additionally, the authors reference two more datasets from the **ABIDE initiative**: **UM** and **UCLA**, which are used to train a global model and evaluate diagnostic performance. This indicates that these datasets are also relevant to the study.

Now, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **NYU dataset**, the citation is:
   > Craddock, C., Benhajali, Y., Chu, C., Chouinard, F., Evans, A., Jakab, A., Khundrakpam, B.S., Lewis, J.D., Li, Q., Milham, M., Yan, C., Bellec, P. (2013). The neuro bureau preprocessing initiative: Open sharing of preprocessed neuroimaging data and derivatives. *Frontiers in Neuroinformatics*, 7, 27.

2. For the **ABIDE initiative**, the citation is:
   > Di Martino, A., Yan, C.G., Li, Q., Denio, E., Castellanos, F.X., et al. (2014). The autism brain imaging data exchange: Towards a large-scale evaluation of the intrinsic brain architecture in autism. *Molecular Psychiatry*, 19(6), 659-667.

With these citations, I have successfully identified and documented the datasets used in the research paper. I will now compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing.
