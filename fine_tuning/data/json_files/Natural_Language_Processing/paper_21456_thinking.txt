To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A real-time Artificial Intelligence system for learning Sign Language" by Elisa Cabana, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and data sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the development of a technology to assist in learning Sign Language, which suggests that datasets related to Sign Language might be involved.

In the **introduction**, the author discusses the challenges faced by the deaf community and the importance of Sign Language, but I need to look for specific datasets mentioned. The **data section** is crucial, as it details the dataset used for training the neural network model for Sign Language recognition.

In the **data section**, the author describes the dataset they compiled, which consists of images of the American Sign Language (ASL) alphabet signs. The dataset includes 88,000 images of size 192 Ã— 192, capturing various hand gestures and conditions. This is a significant dataset for the research.

Next, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The author mentions that they created a diverse set of high-quality images for ASL signs, but does not provide a formal citation for this dataset since it appears to be an original compilation.

Since this dataset is not sourced from an existing published dataset, I will note it as an original dataset created by the authors. I will document the dataset details as follows:

1. **ASL Alphabet Dataset**: A dataset of 88,000 images of ASL alphabet signs, compiled by the authors for training their neural network model.

Now, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring to include the necessary details and the citation for the paper itself:

- For the **ASL Alphabet Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Cabana, E. (2023). A real-time Artificial Intelligence system for learning Sign Language. CUNEF University, Madrid, Spain.

Finally, I will summarize the dataset information and prepare it for structured output, ensuring that all relevant details are included for future reference or processing.
