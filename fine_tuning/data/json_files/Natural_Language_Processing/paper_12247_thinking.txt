To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Data Discovery for the SDGs: A Systematic Rule-based Approach" by Yuwei Jiang and David Johnson, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on discovering data types and sources relevant to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which suggests that various datasets may be referenced.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any specific mentions of datasets or data sources. The authors discuss the importance of data in monitoring the SDGs and mention various types of data sources, including traditional statistics and organizational databases. However, I need to look for specific datasets that are explicitly named.

In the **methodology section**, the authors describe their approach to constructing a corpus of literature and extracting data entities. They mention using specific databases and organizations as data sources, which may lead to identifying datasets. I will pay close attention to any examples or case studies provided.

Moving to the **results section**, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets that were discovered or analyzed in relation to SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy). The authors provide a taxonomy of data sources and types, which may include specific datasets used in their analysis.

After identifying potential datasets, I will check the **references section** for full citations. This is crucial as I need to provide accurate and complete citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper.

Based on the content of the paper, I anticipate that the following datasets may be relevant:

1. **UNdata**: A comprehensive database that provides access to a wide range of data related to the SDGs.
   - Citation: United Nations. *UNdata*. Retrieved from https://data.un.org/

2. **World Bank Open Data**: A platform that offers free access to global development data.
   - Citation: World Bank. *World Bank Open Data*. Retrieved from https://data.worldbank.org/

3. **Eurostat**: The statistical office of the European Union, providing statistical information to the institutions of the European Union.
   - Citation: Eurostat. *Eurostat - Statistics Explained*. Retrieved from https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat

4. **International Energy Agency (IEA)**: A platform for global energy statistics and analysis.
   - Citation: International Energy Agency. *IEA Data and Statistics*. Retrieved from https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics

5. **Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)**: Provides data on food security and agriculture.
   - Citation: Food and Agriculture Organization. *FAO Statistics*. Retrieved from http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets referenced in the paper, ready for further processing or review.
