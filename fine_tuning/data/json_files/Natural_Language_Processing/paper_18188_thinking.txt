To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Even-if Explanations: Formal Foundations, Priorities and Complexity" by Gianvincenzo Alfano et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's focus, but it may not explicitly mention datasets. Therefore, I will pay close attention to the introduction, where the authors often discuss the context and relevance of their work, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets or experiments**. In many research papers, authors will describe the datasets used for their experiments in a specific section, often labeled "Datasets" or "Experiments." This section typically includes detailed descriptions of the datasets, such as their size, type, and any relevant characteristics.

If the paper includes a **results or discussion section**, I will review it to see if the authors reference any datasets in the context of their findings. This can provide additional insights into how the datasets were utilized in the research.

Once I identify the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. It is crucial to ensure that I capture the correct citation format, which typically includes the authors, title, publication venue, and year.

For example, if I find that the authors used a dataset like the "UCI Machine Learning Repository," I would look for the specific citation associated with that dataset, which might be formatted as follows:
> Dua, D. and Graff, C. (2019). *UCI Machine Learning Repository*. University of California, Irvine, School of Information and Computer Sciences.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation.

Finally, I will organize this information in a clear and structured manner, ready for any further processing or review.
