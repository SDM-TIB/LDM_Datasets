To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Medical Spoken Named Entity Recognition" by Khai Le-Duc et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any datasets mentioned. The authors introduce **VietMed-NER**, which they claim is the first spoken NER dataset in the medical domain. This indicates that a dataset is indeed present.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for further details. The authors mention that VietMed-NER is built on the **VietMed dataset**, which is described as the world's largest and most generalizable medical ASR dataset. This suggests that both VietMed-NER and VietMed are important datasets to note.

In the **data collection section (2.1)**, the authors explicitly state that they chose the VietMed dataset for annotating named entities. This confirms that VietMed is a foundational dataset for their work.

I will also look into the **data statistics section (2.4)**, where the authors provide detailed statistics about the VietMed-NER dataset, including the number of sentences and entity types. This section will help me describe the dataset comprehensively.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for both datasets:

1. For **VietMed-NER**, since it is a new dataset introduced in this paper, I will cite it as follows:
   > Khai Le-Duc, David Thulke, Hung-Phong Tran, Long Vo-Dang, Khai-Nguyen Nguyen, Truong-Son Hy, Ralf Schlüter. *Medical Spoken Named Entity Recognition*. In Proceedings of the 2024 Joint International Conference on Computational Linguistics, Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC-COLING 2024), pages 17365–17370.

2. For **VietMed**, which is referenced as the source dataset, I will cite it as follows:
   > Khai Le-Duc. 2024. *VietMed: A dataset and benchmark for automatic speech recognition of Vietnamese in the medical domain*. In Proceedings of the 2024 Joint International Conference on Computational Linguistics, Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC-COLING 2024), pages 17365–17370.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and citations. This will ensure that I have a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
