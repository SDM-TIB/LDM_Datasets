To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Asymmetric double-winged multi-view clustering network for exploring Diverse and Consistent Information" by Qun Zheng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant details, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the framework's efficacy is validated through extensive experiments on **six widely used benchmark datasets**. This indicates that datasets are indeed present, and I need to identify them.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this section, the authors provide a summary table (Table 1) that lists the datasets used, along with their characteristics such as the number of samples, clusters, and views. The datasets mentioned are:

1. **Reuters**: 1200 samples, 6 clusters, 5 views.
2. **CALTECH101_7**: 1400 samples, 7 clusters, 5 views.
3. **UCI_digit**: 2000 samples, 10 clusters, 3 views.
4. **CALTECH101**: 9144 samples, 102 clusters, 5 views.
5. **Hdigit**: 10000 samples, 10 clusters, 2 views.
6. **STL10_4Views**: 13000 samples, 10 clusters, 3 views.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The paper provides links or references for some datasets, which I will use to construct the citations:

- For **Reuters**, the citation is:
  > "Reuters-21578 Text Categorization Collection." UCI Machine Learning Repository. Available at: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Reuters-21578+Text+Categorization+Collection.

- For **CALTECH101_7**, the citation is:
  > "Caltech 101." Caltech Data Repository. Available at: https://data.caltech.edu/records/mzrjq-6wc02.

- For **UCI_digit**, the citation is:
  > "UCI Digit Dataset." Available at: https://cs.nyu.edu/~roweis/data.html.

- For **CALTECH101**, the citation is:
  > "Caltech 101." Caltech Data Repository. Available at: https://data.caltech.edu/records/mzrjq-6wc02.

- For **Hdigit**, the citation is:
  > "Hdigit Dataset." Available at: https://cs.nyu.edu/~roweis/data.html.

- For **STL10_4Views**, the citation is:
  > "STL10 Dataset." Stanford University. Available at: https://cs.stanford.edu/~acoates/stl10/.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
