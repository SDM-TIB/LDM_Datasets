To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Global AI Governance in Healthcare: A Cross-Jurisdictional Regulatory Analysis" by Attrayee Chakraborty and Mandar Karhade, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract provides a high-level overview of the paper's focus on regulatory approaches, but I need to look for specific datasets used in the analysis.

Next, I will examine the **material and methods section** closely, as it typically outlines the datasets utilized in the research. In this paper, the authors mention conducting a legal analysis of **25 publicly available laws, guidance documents, and regulations** across **14 legal jurisdictions**. However, they do not specify individual datasets in the traditional sense (like image or text datasets) but rather refer to legal documents and regulations as the primary data sources.

I will also check the **results and conclusion sections** to see if the authors summarize or reference specific datasets or documents that were analyzed. They discuss various regulatory frameworks and guidelines, but again, these are not datasets in the conventional sense.

Since the paper does not provide traditional datasets but rather a collection of legal documents, I will compile a list of these documents as "datasets" for the purpose of this exercise. I will ensure to include full citations for each document mentioned in the paper.

Now, I will gather the citations for the legal documents and regulations referenced throughout the paper. This includes:

1. **EU AI Act**: 
   > European Parliament. (2024). *EU AI Act*. Retrieved from [link to the document].

2. **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)**:
   > European Union. (2018). *General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)*. Retrieved from [link to the document].

3. **Health Canada Guidance**:
   > Health Canada. (2023). *Guidance on AI/ML based Medical Devices*. Retrieved from [link to the document].

4. **AI Strategy 2022 (Japan)**:
   > Government of Japan. (2022). *AI Strategy 2022*. Retrieved from [link to the document].

5. **Egyptian Charter on Responsible AI**:
   > Government of Egypt. (2023). *Egyptian Charter on Responsible AI*. Retrieved from [link to the document].

6. **National AI Policy (Rwanda)**:
   > Ministry of ICT and Innovation, Rwanda. (2020). *National AI Policy*. Retrieved from [link to the document].

7. **Bill No. 2338/2023 (Brazil)**:
   > Senate of Brazil. (2023). *Bill No. 2338/2023*. Retrieved from [link to the document].

8. **Guidance on AI/ML based Medical Devices (Saudi Arabia)**:
   > Saudi Food and Drug Authority (SFDA). (2023). *Guidance on AI/ML based Medical Devices*. Retrieved from [link to the document].

After compiling these references, I will ensure that each entry is formatted correctly and includes all necessary details for citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets (in this case, legal documents) referenced in the paper.

Finally, I will prepare the structured output for review or further processing, ensuring that all citations are accurate and complete.
