To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Word Embeddings are Capable of Capturing Rhythmic Similarity of Words" by Hosein Rezaei, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the research investigates the usefulness of word embeddings in capturing rhythmic similarity, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the author discusses the hypothesis and mentions that the investigation is conducted on several datasets and texts, including literature and non-literature corpora. This indicates that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, particularly **subsection 4.1 (Corpora)**, where the author provides an overview of the datasets used in the experiments. The paper lists three corpora:

1. **Quran Corpus**: This corpus contains 82,624 total words and 17,627 unique words, with an average word length of 9.77.
2. **Gutenberg Dataset**: This dataset includes 166,000 total words and 16,545 unique words, with an average word length of 6.63.
3. **CNN Corpus**: This corpus has 529,359 total words and 26,279 unique words, with an average word length of 7.45.

The author also notes that the Quran corpus was the basis for early observations, and the other two corpora were included to see if similar patterns could be observed.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **Quran Corpus**, the citation is:
  > Imad Zeroual and Abdelhak Lakhouaja. *A new Quranic corpus rich in morphosyntactical information*. International Journal of Speech Technology, 19(2):339–346, 2016.

- For the **Gutenberg Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Steven Bird, Ewan Klein, and Edward Loper. *Natural language processing with Python: analyzing text with the natural language toolkit*. "O’Reilly Media, Inc.", 2009.

- For the **CNN Corpus**, the citation is:
  > Rafael Dueire Lins et al. *The CNN-Corpus: A large textual corpus for single-document extractive summarization*. In Proceedings of the ACM Symposium on Document Engineering 2019, pages 1–10, 2019.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
