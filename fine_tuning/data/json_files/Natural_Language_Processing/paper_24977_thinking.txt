To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Object recognition in primates: What can early visual areas contribute?" by Christian Quaia and Richard J Krauzlis, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus, while the introduction may highlight the significance of the datasets used.

Next, I will pay particular attention to the **methods section**, as it typically contains detailed descriptions of the datasets utilized in the experiments. In this paper, the authors mention assembling three sets of images for their classification tasks:

1. **Face Dataset**: This dataset consists of 1,756 frontal images of human faces, derived from a larger set shared by Prof. Doris Tsao. The authors describe the selection process, including the removal of images with lower resolution or occlusions.

2. **Non-Face Dataset**: This dataset includes 1,502 images of non-face stimuli, which encompass a variety of human-made objects, animals, fruits, and vegetables. The authors explain how they selected these images from freely available sources on the web.

3. **Landscape Dataset**: The authors collected 1,525 images of urban and natural landscapes from MIT's Places dataset, ensuring that the selected images did not include humans or animals. They also describe the preprocessing steps taken to prepare these images for analysis.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **references section** for full citations related to the datasets mentioned. The citations for the datasets are crucial for proper attribution and should be included in the final output.

For the **Face Dataset**, the citation is:
> Tsao, D. Y. (personal communication).

For the **Places Dataset**, the citation is:
> Zhou, B., Lapedriza, A., Khosla, A., Oliva, A., and Torralba, A. (2018). Places: A 10 million image database for scene recognition. IEEE Trans. Pattern Anal. Mach. Intell. 40, 1452â€“1464. doi:10.1109/TPAMI.2017.2723009.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and includes the full citation for proper referencing. This structured approach will help ensure that all relevant information is captured accurately and comprehensively.
