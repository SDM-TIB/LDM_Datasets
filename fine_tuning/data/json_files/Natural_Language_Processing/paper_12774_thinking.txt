To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Novel Class Discovery for Long-tailed Recognition" by Chuyu Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors performed extensive experiments on several datasets, which indicates that there are datasets to be extracted.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors mention using the following datasets:

1. **CIFAR100**: A well-known dataset for image classification containing 100 classes with 600 images per class.
2. **ImageNet100**: A subset of the larger ImageNet dataset, specifically tailored for the experiments.
3. **Herbarium19**: A dataset used for fine-grained classification of plant species.
4. **iNaturalist18**: A large-scale dataset for species classification, which is also used in the experiments.

I will confirm the details of these datasets in the **experiments section**, where the authors provide specific information about the datasets used, including their characteristics and the number of classes and samples.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

- **CIFAR100**:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton, et al. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. 2009.

- **ImageNet100**:
  > Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, and Li Fei-Fei. *Imagenet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In 2009 IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pp. 248–255. IEEE, 2009.

- **Herbarium19**:
  > Kiat Chuan Tan, Yulong Liu, Barbara Ambrose, Melissa Tulig, and Serge Belongie. *The herbarium challenge 2019 dataset*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1906.05372, 2019.

- **iNaturalist18**:
  > Grant Van Horn, Oisin Mac Aodha, Yang Song, Yin Cui, Chen Sun, Alex Shepard, Hartwig Adam, Pietro Perona, and Serge Belongie. *The inaturalist species classification and detection dataset*. In Proceedings of the IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pp. 8769–8778, 2018.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will facilitate further research and validation of the findings presented in the paper.
