To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Line Graphics Digitization: A Step Towards Full Automation" by Omar Moured et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract introduces the **Line Graphics (LG) dataset**, which is a key focus of the paper. It states that this dataset includes pixel-wise annotations for various categories, indicating that it is a significant contribution of the research.

Next, I will look for specific details about the **Line Graphics (LG) dataset** in the **dataset section** (Section 3). Here, the authors provide a comprehensive description of the dataset, including its size (520 images), the number of documents it was collected from (450), and the types of annotations (pixel-wise for 10 fine-grained categories and 5 coarse categories). This section confirms that the LG dataset is the primary dataset used in their experiments.

I will also check the **experiments section** to see if any other datasets are mentioned. The authors compare their LG dataset with other related datasets in **Table 1**, which lists several datasets relevant to document graphics analysis. However, the focus remains on the LG dataset as the main dataset for their experiments.

Now, I will gather the full citations for the datasets mentioned in the paper. The authors reference several related datasets, but the primary dataset is the **Line Graphics (LG) dataset**. Since the paper does not provide a separate citation for the LG dataset, I will create a citation based on the information provided in the paper:

  > Omar Moured, Jiaming Zhang, Alina Roitberg, Thorsten Schwarz, and Rainer Stiefelhagen. *Line Graphics Digitization: A Step Towards Full Automation*. In Proceedings of the [Conference Name], [Year], [Pages]. [Publisher].

For the other datasets mentioned in **Table 1**, I will extract their citations from the references section:

1. **PDFFigures 2.0**:
   > Clark, C., & Divvala, S. (2016). *PDFFigures 2.0: Mining figures from research papers*. In Proceedings of the 16th ACM/IEEE-CS on Joint Conference on Digital Libraries (pp. 143–152).

5. **ICDAR Charts 2019**:

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used and referenced in the paper, ready for further processing or review.
