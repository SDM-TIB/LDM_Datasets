To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Autonomous Interactive Correction MLLM for Robust Robotic Manipulation" by Chuyan Xiong et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental results sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions "extensive experiments conducted in both simulated and real-world environments," which suggests that datasets may be involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental results section** (Section 4) where the authors describe their experimental setup. Here, they mention using the **PartNet-Mobility dataset** to set up the experiment environment. This indicates that this dataset is relevant to their work.

In **Section 4.1 (Experiment Setting)**, the authors state that they randomly sampled about 12,000 successful manipulation samples across 20 categories to build dataset **Do**. They also mention augmenting this dataset with necessary training information, leading to the creation of **Daug**. This is another dataset that needs to be documented.

I will also check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For the **PartNet-Mobility dataset**, the citation is:
> Mo, K., Zhu, S., Chang, A. X., Yi, L., Tripathi, S., Guibas, L. J., & Su, H. (2019). *PartNet: A large-scale benchmark for fine-grained and hierarchical part-level 3D object understanding*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 2019–2028.

For the dataset **Do**, since it is a dataset created by the authors, I will note that it is not publicly available and does not have a formal citation. However, I will document it as follows:
> Do: A dataset created by the authors containing 12,000 successful manipulation samples across 20 categories.

For the dataset **Daug**, which is an augmented version of **Do**, I will similarly note that it is derived from the original dataset and does not have a separate citation.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations into a structured format for clarity and completeness.

1. **PartNet-Mobility Dataset**:
   - Citation: Mo, K., Zhu, S., Chang, A. X., Yi, L., Tripathi, S., Guibas, L. J., & Su, H. (2019). *PartNet: A large-scale benchmark for fine-grained and hierarchical part-level 3D object understanding*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 2019–2028.

2. **Do**:
   - Description: A dataset created by the authors containing 12,000 successful manipulation samples across 20 categories.

3. **Daug**:
   - Description: An augmented version of dataset Do, containing additional training information.

After gathering all this information, I will ensure that the dataset entries are clearly documented and ready for any further processing or review.
