To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "IIANet: An Intra- and Inter-Modality Attention Network for Audio-Visual Speech Separation" by Kai Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on three standard audio-visual separation benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention three datasets:

1. **LRS2 Dataset**: The authors describe it as consisting of thousands of BBC video clips, divided into training, validation, and test sets. They note that the dataset was created by mixing speeches from two different speakers with varying signal-to-noise ratios.

2. **LRS3 Dataset**: This dataset includes thousands of spoken sentences from TED and TEDx videos, also divided into training and test sets. The authors highlight that it has relatively less noise compared to LRS2.

3. **VoxCeleb2 Dataset**: The authors explain that this dataset contains over one million sentences from 6,112 individuals extracted from YouTube videos, and it is also divided into development and test sets.

To ensure accuracy, I will check the **References section** for the full citations of these datasets:

- For **LRS2 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Afouras, T., Chung, J. S., Senior, A., Vinyals, O., and Zisserman, A. "Deep audio-visual speech recognition." *IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence*, 44(12):8717â€“8727, 2018a.

- For **LRS3 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Afouras, T., Chung, J. S., and Zisserman, A. "LRS3-TED: A large-scale dataset for visual speech recognition." 2018b.

- For **VoxCeleb2 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Chung, J. S., Nagrani, A., and Zisserman, A. "VoxCeleb2: Deep speaker recognition." 2018.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its full citation for clarity and completeness.
