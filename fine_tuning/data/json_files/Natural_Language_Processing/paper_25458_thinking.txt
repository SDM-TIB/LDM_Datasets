To extract datasets from the research paper titled "LIMT: Language-Informed Multi-Task Visual World Models" by Elie Aljalbout et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their approach using multiple robotic manipulation tasks from the **CALVIN dataset**. This indicates that a dataset is indeed involved.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **methodology and experiments sections**. In the introduction, the authors refer to the **CALVIN dataset** as the source for the robotic manipulation tasks. This is a key dataset that I need to document.

In the **experiments section**, the authors describe their setup and mention that they focus on six specific tasks: open drawer, close drawer, move slider left, move slider right, turn on lightbulb, and turn on LED, all of which are part of the **CALVIN dataset**. This confirms that the dataset is central to their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the **CALVIN dataset**. The citation provided in the references is:

- **CALVIN dataset**:
  > O. Mees, L. Hermann, E. Rosete-Beas, and W. Burgard. *Calvin: A benchmark for language-conditioned policy learning for long-horizon robot manipulation tasks*. IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters, 7(3):7327â€“7334, 2022. doi:10.1109/LRA.2022.3180108.

Having identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the findings:

1. **CALVIN dataset**: This dataset is used for evaluating the proposed method on multiple robotic manipulation tasks, providing a benchmark for language-conditioned policy learning.

Now, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or processing, ensuring that the full citation is included for clarity and reference.
