To extract datasets from the research paper titled "UAVD4L: A Large-Scale Dataset for UAV 6-DoF Localization" by Rouwan Wu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract introduces the UAVD4L dataset, which is a large-scale dataset for 6-DoF localization of UAVs. This indicates that the dataset is central to the research.

Next, I will examine the **methodology** and **experiments** sections, particularly focusing on the **Dataset** section, which is likely to provide detailed descriptions of the dataset used. In this paper, the authors describe the UAVD4L dataset, which includes a textured 3D reference model and query images with accurate ground truth poses.

In the **Dataset** section, the authors provide specific details about the UAVD4L dataset, including its size (approximately 2.5 million square meters), the types of scenes it covers (urban and rural), and the methods used for data collection and ground truth generation. This information is crucial for understanding the dataset's scope and application.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the UAVD4L dataset. The citation is essential for proper attribution and to guide readers to the original source. The authors mention that the dataset and code are available at a specific GitHub link, which I will note as well.

The full citation for the UAVD4L dataset is:
> Rouwan Wu, Xiaoya Cheng, Juelin Zhu, Xuxiang Liu, Maojun Zhang, and Shen Yan. *UAVD4L: A Large-Scale Dataset for UAV 6-DoF Localization*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA), 2023.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and full citation. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the dataset extracted from the paper.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for UAVD4L, ensuring that it is ready for review or further processing.
