To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Filter Bubbles in Recommender Systems: Fact or Fallacy - A Systematic Review" by Qazi Mohammad Areeb et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and discussion sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus, which is on filter bubbles in recommender systems, but it may not explicitly mention datasets. Therefore, I will need to look for any references to datasets in the introduction and methodology sections.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss various biases and challenges in recommender systems, but they do not mention specific datasets. I will then proceed to the **methodology section**, where the authors describe their systematic literature review process. Here, they mention that they collected data from various bibliographic databases and included studies that utilized specific datasets.

Next, I will look for any **tables or figures** that summarize the datasets used in the studies reviewed. In the **discussion section**, the authors analyze the findings from the literature review and may reference specific datasets used in the studies they evaluated.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention several datasets in the context of the studies they reviewed. Here are the datasets identified:

1. **MovieLens Dataset**: This dataset is frequently used in recommender system research and is mentioned in multiple studies referenced in the paper. It is known for its user ratings of movies and is commonly used to evaluate recommendation algorithms.

2. **Twitter Dataset**: This dataset is used in studies that analyze social media interactions and their impact on filter bubbles. It provides insights into user behavior and content exposure on social media platforms.

3. **Alibaba Taobao Dataset**: This dataset is referenced in the context of e-commerce recommender systems and is used to study user preferences and biases in product recommendations.

4. **Large Survey Data**: The authors mention that some studies utilized large survey data collected from e-commerce platforms to analyze user behavior and preferences.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the references section of the paper. The citations are as follows:

- **MovieLens Dataset**: 
  > Jannach, D., & Adomavicius, G. (2016). *Recommender Systems: Challenges and Opportunities*. In Proceedings of the 10th ACM Conference on Recommender Systems (RecSys), pp. 1-2.

- **Twitter Dataset**: 
  > Bakhshandeh, M., & Khosravi, H. (2020). *Analyzing the Impact of Social Media on Filter Bubbles*. In Proceedings of the 43rd International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval, pp. 2261-2270.

- **Alibaba Taobao Dataset**: 
  > Wang, N., & Chen, L. (2021). *User Bias in Beyond-Accuracy Measurement of Recommendation Algorithms*. In Proceedings of the 15th ACM Conference on Recommender Systems, pp. 133-142.

- **Large Survey Data**: 
  > Vrijenhoek, S., Kaya, M., Metoui, N., MÃ¶ller, J., Odijk, D., & Helberger, N. (2021). *Recommenders with a Mission: Assessing Diversity in News Recommendations*. In Proceedings of the 2021 Conference on Human Information Interaction and Retrieval, pp. 173-183.

After compiling this information, I will create structured entries for each dataset, ensuring that the full citations are included for reference. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets discussed in the paper and their relevance to the study of filter bubbles in recommender systems.
