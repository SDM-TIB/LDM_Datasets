To extract datasets from the research paper titled "How Cute is Pikachu? Gathering and Ranking Pokémon Properties from Data with Pokémon Word Embeddings" by Mika Hämäläinen, Khalid Alnajjar, and Niko Partanen, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors trained word embeddings models on a crawled Pokémon corpus, which suggests that there is a dataset involved.

Next, I will examine **section 2 (Data and Preprocessing)**, where the authors describe the sources of their data. They mention two key datasets:

1. **Pokémon Description Corpus**: This dataset is derived from Giantbomb entries, which provide concise descriptions of Pokémon characteristics and abilities. The authors note that this corpus is not structured but consists of free-form textual descriptions.

2. **Pokémon Stories Corpus**: This larger dataset is composed of fan-authored stories about Pokémon, specifically those that are in English and contain at least 10,000 words. The authors crawled a total of 8,011 stories that meet these criteria.

In the **results section**, the authors discuss the outcomes of their experiments using these datasets, confirming their relevance and application in the study.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. However, the paper does not provide formal citations for the datasets themselves, as they are derived from publicly available sources (Giantbomb and fanfiction websites). Therefore, I will create citations based on the information provided:

- For the **Pokémon Description Corpus**, I will cite Giantbomb as follows:
  > Giantbomb. *Giantbomb Pokémon Entries*. Available at: https://www.giantbomb.com/

- For the **Pokémon Stories Corpus**, I will cite the fanfiction website:
  > Fanfiction.net. *Fanfiction Stories about Pokémon*. Available at: https://www.fanfiction.net/

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that highlights the datasets used in the research, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear overview of the data sources utilized in the study.
