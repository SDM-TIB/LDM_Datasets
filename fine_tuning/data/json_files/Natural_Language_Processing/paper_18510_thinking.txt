To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Detection of Signals in Colored Noise: Leading Eigenvalue Test for Non-central F-matrices" by Prathapasinghe Dharmawansa et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, but it may not explicitly mention datasets. The introduction often discusses prior work and may reference datasets used in related studies.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets or experiments**. In this paper, there is no explicit section labeled "Datasets," but I will check the **experiments or methodology sections** for any mention of datasets used for testing or validation. 

As I read through the paper, I will pay attention to any references to datasets, including their names, descriptions, and any relevant details such as the number of samples or specific characteristics. If the authors refer to datasets used in previous studies, I will note those as well.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets.

For example, if the authors mention using a dataset from a previous study, I will look for that study in the references and extract the full citation. If the paper does not provide a specific dataset but discusses a method that relies on a common dataset, I will note that as well.

Finally, I will compile the identified datasets along with their full citations into a structured format for clarity and ease of use. This will ensure that all relevant information is captured and can be easily referenced in future work.

In summary, my steps will be:
1. Read the abstract, introduction, and methodology sections for mentions of datasets.
2. Look for any dedicated sections on experiments or methodology that may describe datasets.
3. Note any datasets mentioned, including their characteristics.
4. Consult the References section for full citations of the datasets.
5. Compile the information into a clear format for future reference.
