To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Streamlining Ocean Dynamics Modeling with Fourier Neural Operators: A Multiobjective Hyperparameter and Architecture Optimization Approach" by Yixuan Sun et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for training or evaluation. The introduction often discusses the context and significance of the datasets, while the methods section typically details the experimental setup, including any datasets utilized.

In the **introduction**, I will look for any references to datasets or data generation processes. The authors may describe the types of data they are working with or cite previous works that provided datasets.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiment)**, particularly **subsection 4.1 (Dataset)**, where the authors explicitly describe the dataset used in their experiments. Here, they mention that they adopted and simplified data generated from a previous study, which consisted of 100 simulations of various oceanographic variables. The details provided include the dimensions of the data and how it was generated, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's structure.

The dataset mentioned is:
- **Idealized Baroclinic Wind-Driven Ocean Model Dataset**: This dataset includes simulations of salinity, temperature, zonal velocity, and meridional velocity at the ocean surface. The authors specify that the data was obtained from the Simulating Ocean Mesoscale Activity (SOMA) test case and describe the dimensions and structure of the dataset.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the original dataset source. The authors reference the work from which the dataset was derived, which is essential for proper attribution.

The citation for the dataset is:
> Yixuan Sun, E. Cucuzzella, S. Brus, S. H. K. Narayanan, B. Nadiga, L. Van Roekel, J. HÃ¼ckelheim, and S. Madireddy. *Surrogate neural networks to estimate parametric sensitivity of ocean models*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2311.08421, 2023.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring that I include the full citation for the dataset as required. This structured approach ensures that I accurately capture all relevant details about the dataset used in the research paper.
