To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Cognitive-Motor Integration in Assessing Bimanual Motor Skills" by Erim Yanik et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on assessing bimanual motor skills using deep neural networks, which suggests that datasets related to motor skills assessment may be present.

Next, I will examine the **methods section**, particularly the **dataset characteristics** subsection, where the authors describe the tasks and data collection process. Here, they mention two specific laparoscopic tasks from the Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery (FLS) program: **pattern cutting** and **suturing**. 

1. **Pattern Cutting Dataset**: The authors detail that this dataset includes data from seven inexperienced residents who executed 475 trials over 12 days. The performance was evaluated using FLS scoring, resulting in 444 Pass and 31 Fail trials.

2. **Suturing Dataset**: This dataset comprises data from eight residents and ten surgeons, producing 63 trials. The scoring was based on the Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skills (OSATS) criteria, focusing on various performance metrics.

In the **results section**, the authors discuss the performance metrics associated with these tasks, confirming that both datasets were utilized for their analysis.

Now, I will look into the **references section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper cites the following relevant works:

- For the **Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery (FLS)** program, the citation is:
  > Fried, G. M. et al. *FLS assessment of competency using simulated laparoscopic tasks*. Journal of Gastrointestinal Surgery 12, 210–212 (2008).

- For the **Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skills (OSATS)**, the citation is:
  > Martin, J. A. et al. *Objective structured assessment of technical skill (OSATS) for surgical residents*. British Journal of Surgery 84, 273–278 (1997).

With this information, I can now summarize the datasets and their citations:

1. **Pattern Cutting Dataset**: 
   - Description: Data from seven inexperienced residents executing 475 trials in laparoscopic pattern cutting, evaluated using FLS scoring.
   - Citation: Fried, G. M. et al. *FLS assessment of competency using simulated laparoscopic tasks*. Journal of Gastrointestinal Surgery 12, 210–212 (2008).

2. **Suturing Dataset**: 
   - Description: Data from eight residents and ten surgeons producing 63 trials, scored using OSATS criteria.
   - Citation: Martin, J. A. et al. *Objective structured assessment of technical skill (OSATS) for surgical residents*. British Journal of Surgery 84, 273–278 (1997).

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
