To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Mullerâ€™s Ratchet in a Near-Critical Regime: Tournament Versus Fitness Proportional Selection" by Jan Lukas Igelbrink et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus, but it may not contain specific dataset names. The introduction often discusses previous work and may reference datasets used in those studies.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets or experiments**. In this paper, I will specifically check sections that discuss the methodology or experiments, as they typically detail the datasets used for simulations or analyses. 

While reading through the **experiments section**, I will note any datasets explicitly mentioned, including their names, sizes, and any relevant characteristics. If the authors refer to datasets from previous studies, I will ensure to capture those references as well.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for the datasets used. I will look for any papers that are cited in relation to the datasets, ensuring I capture the complete citation format as required.

For example, if the authors mention using a dataset from a previous study, I will find that study in the references and extract the full citation. If they introduce a new dataset, I will summarize its details and provide a citation if available.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including names, descriptions, and citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details regarding the datasets used in the research.
