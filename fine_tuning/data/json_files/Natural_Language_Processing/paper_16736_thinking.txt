To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ASPEN: High-Throughput LoRA Fine-Tuning of Large Language Models with a Single GPU" by Zhengmao Ye et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the efficiency of the ASPEN framework but does not specify any datasets. The introduction mentions the use of pre-trained models and fine-tuning but does not provide specific dataset names either.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where datasets are typically detailed. In this section, the authors mention that they fine-tuned several LLMs, including LLaMA-7B/13B and ChatGLM2-6B. They specifically state that they used two public datasets: **AlpacaCleaned** and **Spider**. This is a crucial finding as it directly identifies the datasets used in their experiments.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are essential for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. 

1. For **AlpacaCleaned**, the citation is:
   > Rohan Taori, Ishaan Gulrajani, Tianyi Zhang, Yann Dubois, Xuechen Li, Carlos Guestrin, Percy Liang, and Tatsunori B. Hashimoto. *Stanford Alpaca: An instruction-following LLaMA model*. 2023.

2. For **Spider**, the citation is:
   > Tao Yu, Rui Zhang, Kai Yang, Michihiro Yasunaga, Dongxu Wang, Zifan Li, James Ma, Irene Li, Qingning Yao, Shanelle Roman, Zilin Zhang, and Dragomir Radev. *Spider: A large-scale human-labeled dataset for complex and cross-domain semantic parsing and text-to-sql task*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1809.08887, 2019.

With these citations in hand, I can now summarize the datasets in a structured manner. 

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured output that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all necessary information is accurately represented for future reference or processing.
