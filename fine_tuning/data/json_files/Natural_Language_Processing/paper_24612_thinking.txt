To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Interdisciplinary Expertise to Advance Equitable Explainable AI" by Chloe R. Bennett et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their full citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract discusses the need for rigorous attention to data representativeness and model performance, which suggests that datasets may be involved, but I need to find specific names.

Next, I will examine the **methods and results sections** for any explicit references to datasets used in the research. I will look for sections that describe the data collection process, the types of data analyzed, and any datasets that were specifically mentioned in the context of the study.

In the **methods section**, the authors describe the IDEP framework and its application to a case study involving the StylEx method. They mention that the StylEx method was applied to medical imaging data, specifically fundus photographs, external eye photographs, and chest radiography. This indicates that these types of medical images are part of the datasets used in their analysis.

I will also check the **discussion section** for any additional insights or mentions of datasets that may not have been explicitly stated earlier. The authors discuss the implications of their findings and the importance of understanding biases in datasets, which may lead to further identification of datasets.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. For instance, if the authors refer to specific datasets or studies that provided the data, I will ensure to include those citations.

Based on my findings, I will compile the datasets into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset. This will involve clearly stating the name of the dataset, a brief description, and the corresponding citation.

Finally, I will review my entries to ensure accuracy and completeness before finalizing the dataset extraction.
