To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Improving Large Language Models via Fine-grained Reinforcement Learning with Minimum Editing Constraint" by Zhipeng Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to gather initial insights about the datasets used in the research. The abstract mentions that the experiments were conducted on "mathematical tasks and question-answering tasks," which suggests that there are specific datasets associated with these tasks.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experiment)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they provide a table (Table 2) that lists the datasets along with their respective statistics. The datasets mentioned are:

1. **GSM8k**: A dataset for mathematical reasoning tasks, containing 1319 training examples.
   - Citation: Cobbe, K., Kosaraju, V., Bavarian, M., Chen, M., Jun, H., Tworek, J., et al. (2021). *Training verifiers to solve math word problems*. CoRR, abs/2110.14168.

2. **MATH**: Another dataset for mathematical reasoning, with 5000 training examples.
   - Citation: Hendrycks, D., Burns, C., Basart, S., Zou, A., Mazeika, M., Song, D., & Steinhardt, J. (2021). *Measuring mathematical problem solving with the MATH dataset*.

3. **SVAMP**: A dataset for mathematical reasoning, containing 1000 training examples.
   - Citation: Patel, A., Bhattamishra, S., & Goyal, N. (2021). *Are NLP models really able to solve simple math word problems?* In Proceedings of the 2021 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies.

4. **MM (Mathematical problems in MMLU)**: This dataset is part of the MMLU benchmark, with 974 training examples.
   - Citation: Hendrycks, D., Burns, C., Basart, S., Zou, A., Mazeika, M., Song, D., & Steinhardt, J. (2021). *Measuring massive multitask language understanding*. Proceedings of the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR).

5. **ECQA**: A dataset for question-answering tasks, with 7598 training examples.
   - Citation: Aggarwal, S., Mandowara, D., Agrawal, V., Khandelwal, D., Singla, P., & Garg, D. (2021). *Explanations for commonsenseqa: New dataset and models*. In Proceedings of the 59th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics.

6. **QASC**: Another question-answering dataset, containing 8134 training examples.
   - Citation: Khot, T., Clark, P., Guerquin, M., Jansen, P., & Sabharwal, A. (2020). *QASC: A dataset for question answering via sentence composition*. In The Thirty-Fourth AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence.

7. **OpenbookQA (OBQA)**: A dataset for question-answering tasks, with 2194 training examples.
   - Citation: Mihaylov, T., Clark, P., Khot, T., & Sabharwal, A. (2018). *Can a suit of armor conduct electricity? A new dataset for open book question answering*. In Proceedings of the 2018 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing.

8. **ARC (ARC-Easy)**: A dataset for question-answering tasks, containing 926 training examples.
   - Citation: Clark, P., Cowhey, I., Etzioni, O., Khot, T., Sabharwal, A., & Tafjord, O. (2018). *Think you have solved question answering? try arc, the AI2 reasoning challenge*. CoRR, abs/1803.05457.

After identifying these datasets, I will ensure to document their full citations accurately, as they are crucial for proper referencing in any subsequent work or analysis.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format for easy reference and further processing.
