To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Mind the Model, Not the Agent: The Primacy Bias in Model-based RL" by Zhongjian Qiao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors validate their method on multiple continuous control tasks on MuJoCo and DeepMind Control Suite, indicating that these environments may contain datasets or benchmarks relevant to their research.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors describe their methodology and the specific tasks they used for validation. In this section, they mention using **MuJoCo** and **DeepMind Control Suite** for continuous control tasks, and **Atari 100k benchmark** for discrete control tasks. These are likely to be the datasets or environments they utilized for their experiments.

I will then look for any specific details about these datasets in the **appendices or references** sections. The paper provides a detailed description of the tasks used in the experiments, including the number of training steps for each task. This information is crucial for understanding the datasets' structure and usage.

Now, I will compile the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

1. **MuJoCo**: The citation for the MuJoCo physics engine is:
   > Emanuel Todorov, Tom Erez, and Yuval Tassa. *Mujoco: A physics engine for model-based control*. In 2012 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems, pages 5026â€“5033, 2012.

2. **DeepMind Control Suite**: The citation for the DeepMind Control Suite is:
   > Yuval Tassa, Yotam Doron, Alistair Muldal, Tom Erez, Yazhe Li, Diego de Las Casas, David Budden, Abbas Abdolmaleki, Josh Merel, Andrew Lefrancq, et al. *DeepMind control suite*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1801.00690, 2018.

3. **Atari 100k benchmark**: The citation for the Atari 100k benchmark is:
   > Danijar Hafner, Timothy P Lillicrap, Mohammad Norouzi, and Jimmy Ba. *Mastering Atari with discrete world models*. In International Conference on Learning Representations, 2020.

After gathering this information, I will ensure that I format the dataset entries correctly, including the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ready for any structured output or further processing.
