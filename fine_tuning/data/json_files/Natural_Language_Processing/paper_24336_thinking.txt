To extract datasets from the research paper titled "GIEBench: Towards Holistic Evaluation of Group Identity-based Empathy for Large Language Models" by Leyan Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that GIEBench includes "11 identity dimensions, covering 97 group identities with a total of 999 single-choice questions." This suggests that the paper introduces a new dataset, which is a good starting point.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any relevant subsections that detail the construction and characteristics of GIEBench. In the paper, **section 3 (GIEBench)** provides a comprehensive overview of the dataset, including its structure and the methodology used for its creation. 

In this section, I will note the following key points about the dataset:

1. **GIEBench**: This is the primary dataset introduced in the paper, designed to evaluate the empathy of LLMs across various group identities. It consists of 999 entries categorized into 11 identity dimensions, including gender, age, occupation, and race.

Next, I will check the **methodology** section to understand how the dataset was constructed. The authors describe the process of generating topics through internet sourcing, synthetic topic generation using GPT-4, and human annotation. This information is crucial for understanding the dataset's context and reliability.

After gathering the necessary details about GIEBench, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. Since GIEBench is a new benchmark introduced by the authors, I will cite it as follows:

- For **GIEBench**, the citation is:
  > Leyan Wang, Yonggang Jin, Tianhao Shen, Tianyu Zheng, Xinrun Du, Chenchen Zhang, Wenhao Huang, Jiaheng Liu, Shi Wang, Ge Zhang, Liuyu Xiang, Zhaofeng He. *GIEBench: Towards Holistic Evaluation of Group Identity-based Empathy for Large Language Models*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2405.19327, 2024.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information and citation into a structured format for easy reference. This ensures that I have accurately captured the dataset's details and its citation for future use.
