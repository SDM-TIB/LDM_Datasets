To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The ReprGesture entry to the GENEA Challenge 2022" by Sicheng Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors participated in the GENEA challenge, which suggests that they utilized specific datasets for their experiments.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss gesture generation and mention various techniques and previous works, but I need to look for specific datasets. 

Next, I will focus on the **method section**, particularly the subsection titled **Data and data processing**. Here, the authors explicitly state that they used the **Talking With Hands 16.2M** dataset as the standard dataset for the challenge. They describe the dataset's characteristics, such as its structure and the alignment of audio and text.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the **Talking With Hands 16.2M** dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Gilwoo Lee, Zhiwei Deng, Shugao Ma, Takaaki Shiratori, Siddhartha Srinivasa, and Yaser Sheikh. *Talking With Hands 16.2M: A Large-Scale Dataset of Synchronized Body-Finger Motion and Audio for Conversational Motion Analysis and Synthesis*. In 2019 IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 763â€“772, 2019. https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2019.00085

Since this is the only dataset mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information about it, including its name, description, and citation.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry in the required format, ensuring that I include all necessary details for clarity and completeness. This will allow for easy reference and further analysis of the dataset used in the research.
