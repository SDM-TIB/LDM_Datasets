To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Local Differential Privacy in Graph Neural Networks: a Reconstruction Approach" by Karuna Bhaila et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. In the abstract, the authors mention conducting experiments on "real-world and semi-synthetic datasets," which indicates that datasets are indeed involved, but I need to find their specific names.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (Section V) where the authors provide details about the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they explicitly list four real-world datasets: **Citeseer**, **Cora**, **DBLP**, and **Facebook**, along with two semi-synthetic datasets: **German** and **Student**. I will note down the details provided for each dataset, including their characteristics and the context in which they are used.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide statistics for each dataset, such as the number of nodes, edges, average degree, feature dimensions, and label categories. This information is crucial for understanding the datasets' structure and purpose.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. The paper cites the following sources for the datasets:

1. **Citeseer Dataset**:
   > Sen, P., Namata, G., Bilgic, M., Getoor, L., Gallagher, B., & Eliassi-Rad, T. (2008). Collective classification in network data. *AI Magazine*, 29(3), 93-106.

2. **Cora Dataset**:
   > Bojchevski, A., & GÂ¨unnemann, S. (2018). Deep gaussian embedding of graphs: Unsupervised inductive learning via ranking. In *ICLR*.

3. **DBLP Dataset**:

4. **Facebook Dataset**:

5. **German Dataset**:
   > Bhaila, K., Wu, Y., & Wu, X. (2022). Fair collective classification in networked data. In *Big Data*.

6. **Student Dataset**:
   > Bhaila, K., Wu, Y., & Wu, X. (2022). Fair collective classification in networked data. In *Big Data*.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, along with their respective references for further exploration.
