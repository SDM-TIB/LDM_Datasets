To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Tune As You Scale: Hyperparameter Optimization For Compute Efficient Training" by Abraham J. Fetterman et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract discusses the use of a method called CARBS for tuning models, but it does not specify datasets yet. I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In section 4.1, they mention tuning a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) baseline on the **ProcGen benchmark**. This is a strong indication that a dataset is involved.

I will then look for any specific details about the **ProcGen benchmark** in the text. The authors describe it as a collection of environments for reinforcement learning, which suggests that it is a dataset or a set of tasks rather than a traditional dataset with labeled data.

In section 4.2, they mention tuning GPT-like Transformers on the **C4 dataset**. This is another dataset that needs to be documented.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **ProcGen benchmark**, the citation is:
   > Cobbe, K., Hesse, C., Hilton, J., & Schulman, J. (2019). Leveraging Procedural Generation to Benchmark Reinforcement Learning. arXiv:1912.01588.

2. For the **C4 dataset**, the citation is:
   > Raffel, C., Shazeer, N., Roberts, A., Lee, K., Narang, S., Matena, M., Zhou, Y., Li, W., & Liu, P. J. (2019). Exploring the Limits of Transfer Learning with a Unified Text-to-Text Transformer. arXiv:1910.10683.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
