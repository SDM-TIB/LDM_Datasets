To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Evaluating Machine Learning Models with NERO: Non-Equivariance Revealed on Orbits" by Zhuokai Zhao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the NERO evaluation method and mentions case studies in various research areas, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, they mention applying NERO evaluation to multiple research areas, including:

1. **MNIST Dataset**: This dataset is widely known for digit recognition tasks. The authors state that they use it to illustrate the NERO evaluation process.

2. **MSCOCO Dataset**: The authors mention using this dataset for object detection tasks, specifically with the Faster R-CNN framework.

3. **Johns Hopkins Turbulence Database**: This dataset is referenced in the context of Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) experiments.

4. **ModelNet40 Dataset**: This dataset is used for 3D point cloud classification tasks, and the authors also mention its subset, ModelNet10.

Now, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **MNIST Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun, Léon Bottou, Yoshua Bengio, and Patrick Haffner. *Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition*. Proceedings of the IEEE, 86(11):2278–2324, 1998. doi: 10.1109/5.726791.

- For **MSCOCO Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, Sergio Belongie, et al. *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. arXiv:1405.0312 [cs], 2014.

- For **Johns Hopkins Turbulence Database**, the citation is:
  > Y. Li, E. Perlman, M. Wan, et al. *A public turbulence database cluster and applications to study Lagrangian evolution of velocity increments in turbulence*. Journal of Turbulence, 9:N31, 2008. doi: 10.1080/14685240802376389.

- For **ModelNet40 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Z. Wu, S. Song, A. Khosla, et al. *3D ShapeNets: A Deep Representation for Volumetric Shapes*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2015. doi: 10.1109/CVPR.2015.7298801.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and full citation for each dataset. This ensures that I have accurately captured the necessary details for each dataset referenced in the paper.
