To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Joint Minimum Processing Beamforming and Near-End Listening Enhancement" by Andreas J. Fuglsig et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental evaluation sections** to look for any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and while it may not explicitly mention datasets, it can give insights into the experimental setup.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental evaluation section** (Section 5), as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. I will look for any specific mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and any relevant details about their content or structure.

In this paper, the authors mention using the **TIMIT dataset** for their experiments. I will note the details provided about this dataset, including its purpose and any specific configurations used in the experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the TIMIT dataset. The citation is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the dataset. The TIMIT dataset is referenced in the paper as follows:

- For the **TIMIT dataset**, the citation is:
  > John S. Garofolo, Lori F. Lamel, William M. Fisher, Jonathan G. Fiscus, David S. Pallett, Nancy L. Dahlgren, and Victor Zue. *TIMIT Acoustic-phonetic Continuous Speech Corpus*. Linguistic Data Consortium, 1993.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring that I include the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation as required.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for review or further processing, ensuring that all necessary details are accurately captured and formatted correctly.
