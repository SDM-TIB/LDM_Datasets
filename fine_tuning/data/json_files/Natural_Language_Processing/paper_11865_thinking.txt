To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Surgical fine-tuning for Grape Bunch Segmentation under Visual Domain Shifts" by Agnese Chiatti et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant details and provide full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract highlights the introduction of a new dataset called the **VINEyard Piacenza Image Collections (VINEPICs)**, which is a strong indicator that this dataset will be discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **Materials and Methods** section, specifically the **Datasets** subsection. Here, the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used in their experiments. I will extract the following datasets:

1. **Embrapa Wine Grape Instance Segmentation Dataset (WGISD)**: This dataset is described as comprising 300 high-resolution images depicting 2,020 grape bunches from five grapevine varieties. 

2. **VINEyard Piacenza Image Collections (VINEPICs)**: This dataset is introduced as a novel grape image archive collected at the Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore in Piacenza, Italy. It includes two collections:
   - **VINEPICs21**: The first collection from summer 2021, consisting of 73 RGB images.
   - **VINEPICs22**: A second, more extensive dataset collected in August and September 2022, comprising 165 annotated images with 1,464 grape bunch instances.

I will also note the specific variations within the VINEPICs dataset, such as:
- **VINEPICs22R**: Images from the same grape variety with the same camera viewpoint.
- **VINEPICs22RV**: Images with a different camera viewpoint.
- **VINEPICs22RF**: Images captured from non-defoliated canopies.
- **VINEPICs22C**: Images of Cabernet Sauvignon grapes.
- **VINEPICs22O**: Images of Ortrugo grapes.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to gather the full citations for each dataset:

- For **WGISD**, the citation is:
  > T. T. Santos, L. L. de Souza, A. A. dos Santos, and S. Avila. *Embrapa Wine Grape Instance Segmentation Dataset – Embrapa WGISD*. 2019. [Online]. Available: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3361736

- For **VINEPICs**, the citation is:
  > R. Bertoglio, M. Gatti, S. Poni, and M. Matteucci. *VINEyard Piacenza Image Collections - VINEPICs*. 2023. [Online]. Available: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7866442

Now that I have gathered all necessary information and citations, I will prepare to compile the dataset entries into the required format for further processing or review.
