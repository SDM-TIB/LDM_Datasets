To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Pan-Mamba: Effective pan-sharpening with State Space Model" by Xuanhua He et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that the proposed method was evaluated across diverse datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiment)**, specifically **subsection 4.1 (Datasets and Benchmark)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention three datasets:

1. **WorldView-II (WV2)**: This dataset includes industrial areas and natural landscapes.
2. **Gaofen-2 (GF2)**: This dataset features mountains and rivers.
3. **WorldView-III (WV3)**: This dataset predominantly contains urban roads and urban scenes.

The authors also note that these datasets are characterized by diverse resolutions and a broad spectrum of scenes, which is important for understanding their application in the study.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **WorldView-II**, the citation is:
  > Alparone, L., Wald, L., Chanussot, J., Thomas, C., Gamba, P., Bruce, L.M. (2007). Comparison of pansharpening algorithms: Outcome of the 2006 grs-s data fusion contest. *IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing*, 45(10), 3012–3021.

- For **Gaofen-2**, the citation is:
  > Cai, J., Huang, B. (2021). Super-resolution-guided progressive pansharpening based on a deep convolutional neural network. *IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing*, 59(6), 5206–5220. https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2020.3015878.

- For **WorldView-III**, the citation is:

With this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will allow for a clear understanding of the datasets used in the research and their relevance to the study's findings.
