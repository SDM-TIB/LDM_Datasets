To extract datasets from the research paper titled "One-Shot Unlearning of Personal Identities" by Thomas De Min et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors benchmark their methods on **CelebA** and **CelebA-HQ** datasets, which suggests these are the primary datasets used in their research.

Next, I will look closely at **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe the datasets in detail. They mention that both **CelebA** and **CelebA-HQ** provide annotations for facial attributes, which is crucial for their experiments. The authors specify that they use different unlearning sizes for these datasets, such as **CelebA-HQ/20** and **CelebA-HQ/50**, as well as **CelebA/5** and **CelebA/10**.

To ensure I have the correct citations, I will check the **References section** of the paper. Here are the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. **CelebA Dataset**:
   > Ziwei Liu, Ping Luo, Xiaogang Wang, and Xiaoou Tang. *Deep Learning Face Attributes in the Wild*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2015.

2. **CelebA-HQ Dataset**:
   > Tero Karras, Timo Aila, Samuli Laine, and Jaakko Lehtinen. *Progressive Growing of GANs for Improved Quality, Stability, and Variation*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1710.10196, 2017.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will summarize the key details for each dataset:

- **CelebA**: A large-scale dataset with over 200,000 celebrity images, annotated with 40 facial attributes. It is widely used for facial recognition and attribute prediction tasks.

- **CelebA-HQ**: A high-quality version of the CelebA dataset, consisting of 30,000 images that have been carefully curated and improved for better resolution and quality.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference and further processing.
