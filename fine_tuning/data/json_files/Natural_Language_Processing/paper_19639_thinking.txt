To extract datasets from the research paper titled "OncoGPT: A Medical Conversational Model Tailored with Oncology Domain Expertise on a Large Language Model Meta-AI (LLaMA)" by Fujian Jia et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors established a dataset comprising over **180K+ oncology-related conversations**, which suggests that a significant dataset is involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors discuss the need for specialized datasets in the oncology domain. They mention the creation of a high-quality dataset consisting of **180K+ patient-doctor conversations** that were meticulously reviewed by specialists. This reinforces the importance of this dataset.

In the **materials and methods section**, the authors provide detailed information about how they collected the dataset. They describe the sources of the dialogues, including various online medical consultation websites, and mention that they filtered conversations related to cancer using specific keywords. They also state that the dataset was cleaned and proof-reviewed, which adds to its credibility.

I will also look for any tables or figures that summarize the dataset. In **Table 1**, the authors list the sources of the oncology-specific dialogue data collected, including the number of dialogues from each source and links to those sources. This table is crucial for understanding the dataset's composition.

Now, I will compile the full citations for the datasets mentioned in the paper. The primary dataset is the **180K+ oncology-related conversations**, which is the main focus of their research. The authors do not provide a formal citation for this dataset in the references, but they mention that it is available at their GitHub repository (https://github.com/OncoGPT1). Therefore, I will create a citation for the dataset based on the information provided in the paper.

The citation for the dataset is:

Now, I will summarize the dataset details:
1. **Dataset Name**: Oncology-related Conversations
   - **Description**: A dataset comprising over 180K+ dialogues between patients and doctors, specifically focused on oncology-related queries. The dataset was collected from various online medical consultation platforms and underwent thorough cleaning and proof-review by specialists.
   - **Citation**: Jia, F., Liu, X., Deng, L., Gu, J., Pu, C., Bai, T., Huang, M., Lu, Y., & Liu, K. (2023). *OncoGPT: A Medical Conversational Model Tailored with Oncology Domain Expertise on a Large Language Model Meta-AI (LLaMA)*. Available at: https://github.com/OncoGPT1.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for further processing or review.
