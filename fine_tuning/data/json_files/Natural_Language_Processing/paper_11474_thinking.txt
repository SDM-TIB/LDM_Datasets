To extract datasets from the research paper titled "IsoEx - An explainable unsupervised approach to process event logs’ cyber investigation" by Pierre Lavieille and Ismaël Alaoui Hassani, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the IsoEx method and its application, but I need to look for specific datasets used in the research.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Dataset structure presentation)**, where the authors discuss the dataset used for their experiments. Here, they mention that IsoEx was built around proprietary data obtained through Microsoft Defender’s process events table. This indicates that the dataset is related to process events and logs generated by Microsoft Defender.

The authors describe the dataset as containing unlabeled process creation events, which include various types of logs, the parent-child relationship of processes, and logon information. They also mention that the dataset captures process events and image load events from over 50 devices over a period of 30 days. This is crucial information for understanding the dataset's scope and application.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets or related works mentioned in the paper. The authors reference several works that may provide context or additional datasets relevant to their research. However, since the primary dataset is proprietary and not publicly available, I will focus on citing the relevant papers that discuss similar datasets or methodologies.

1. **Microsoft Defender Process Events Dataset**: The dataset used in the study is proprietary and derived from Microsoft Defender. While there is no formal citation for this dataset, it is essential to acknowledge its source as it forms the basis of the research.

2. **Anomark Dataset**: The authors mention the Anomark method, which uses command line datasets for training. The relevant citation for this method is:
   > Junius, A. (2022). *Detection d’anomalies dans les lignes de commande à l’aide de chaînes de Markov*. ANSSI.

3. **Drain Model**: The authors reference the Drain model for log parsing. The citation for this model is:
   > He, P., Zhu, J., Zheng, Z., & Lyu, M. R. (2017). *Drain: An online log parsing approach with fixed depth tree*. In 2017 IEEE International Conference on Web Services (ICWS) (pp. 33–40).

4. **LogBERT**: The authors also mention LogBERT for log anomaly detection. The citation is:
   > Guo, H., Yuan, S., & Wu, X. (2021). *Logbert: Log anomaly detection via bert*. In 2021 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN) (pp. 1–8).

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries and their citations into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that all relevant datasets and their sources are accurately documented.
