To extract datasets from the research paper titled "XC-NAS: A New Cellular Encoding Approach for Neural Architecture Search of Multi-Path Convolutional Neural Networks" by Trevor Londt et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiment design sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often highlights the significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of designing CNNs and mention that their experiments involve various datasets. However, I need to look for specific names and details in the later sections.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiment Design)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention five datasets:

1. **AG's News Dataset**: A medium-difficulty dataset for text classification.
2. **Yelp Reviews Full Dataset**: A high-difficulty dataset for text classification.
3. **KMNIST Dataset**: An image dataset containing handwritten characters, bridging text and image domains.
4. **Fashion-MNIST Dataset**: A more challenging image dataset compared to KMNIST.
5. **CIFAR-10 Dataset**: A popular benchmark dataset for image classification, considered medium difficulty.

The authors also provide insights into the nature of these datasets, which is crucial for understanding their application in the experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is essential for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily.

The citations I will extract are:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will facilitate further research and validation of the findings presented in the paper.
