To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Crowdsourcing Learning as Domain Adaptation: A Case Study on Named Entity Recognition" by Xin Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on a benchmark crowdsourced NER dataset, which suggests that a specific dataset is being used.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In **section 4.1 (Setting)**, the authors explicitly mention using the **CoNLL-2003 NER English dataset** with crowdsourced annotations provided by Rodrigues and Pereira (2018). This is a clear identification of a dataset.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the CoNLL-2003 dataset and the crowdsourced annotations. The citation for the CoNLL-2003 dataset is:

- For **CoNLL-2003 NER English dataset**:
  > Erik F. Tjong Kim Sang and Fien De Meulder. *Introduction to the CoNLL-2003 shared task: Language-independent named entity recognition*. In Proceedings of the CoNLL at HLT-NAACL 2003.

Additionally, the authors reference the crowdsourced annotations provided by Rodrigues and Pereira (2018). I will look for this citation as well:

- For **crowdsourced annotations**:
  > Filipe Rodrigues and Francisco C. Pereira. *Deep learning from crowds*. In Proceedings of the AAAI.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity.

In summary, the datasets extracted from the paper are:
1. **CoNLL-2003 NER English dataset** with the citation provided.
2. **Crowdsourced annotations** from Rodrigues and Pereira (2018) with the citation provided.

This systematic approach ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their full citations from the research paper.
