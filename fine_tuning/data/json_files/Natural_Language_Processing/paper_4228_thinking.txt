To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Analyzing Power Quality Implications of High Level Charging Rates of Electric Vehicle Within Distribution Networks" by Arash Farokhi Soofi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the impact of EV charging levels on power quality, but it does not specify any datasets. I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine the **methodology and test system sections**. The paper mentions the use of a "modified IEEE-33 bus system" as the test system for their analysis. This indicates that the authors likely used this dataset for their simulations and results.

In the **results section**, the authors discuss various scenarios regarding EV charging levels and their impact on the distribution network. However, they do not provide specific datasets or external data sources used for their analysis. Instead, they focus on the simulation results derived from the IEEE-33 bus system.

Since the paper does not reference any additional datasets or external data sources, I will focus on the IEEE-33 bus system as the primary dataset used in their research.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the IEEE-33 bus system. The IEEE-33 bus system is a well-known benchmark in power systems research, and while the paper may not provide a specific citation, I can refer to the original source of this dataset.

The citation for the IEEE-33 bus system is:
> "IEEE 33-Bus Test System." IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting, 2008.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets, I will summarize the findings as follows:

1. **Dataset Name**: Modified IEEE-33 Bus System
   - **Description**: A benchmark test system used for analyzing the impact of EV charging levels on power quality within distribution networks.
   - **Full Citation**: "IEEE 33-Bus Test System." IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting, 2008.

Now, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
