To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Empowering machine learning models with contextual knowledge for enhancing the detection of eating disorders in social media posts" by José Alberto Benítez-Andrades et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their approach on a dataset of **2,000 tweets about eating disorders**, which is a clear indication that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will look into **section 5 (Experiments and Results)**, where the authors describe the dataset in detail. They mention that the dataset was created by collecting tweets from Twitter using specific hashtags related to eating disorders. The dataset consists of **2,000 tweets** that were labeled into four binary categories, which provides a clear structure for the dataset.

In **section 5.3 (Collecting and labeling ED data)**, the authors detail the process of collecting and labeling the tweets. They explain that the tweets were filtered using hashtags such as anorexia, bulimia, and other related terms. This section confirms the dataset's focus on eating disorders and provides context for its creation.

Now, I will gather the full citation for the dataset mentioned in the paper. The authors state that the dataset is available for download from GitHub, which is a crucial detail for citation purposes. The citation for the dataset is:

> Benítez-Andrades, J.A., Alija-Pérez, J.M., García-Rodríguez, I., Benavides, C., Alaiz-Moretón, H., Vargas, R.P., & García-Ordás, M.T. (2022). *Empowering Machine Learning Models with Contextual Knowledge: Dataset of Tweets Related to Eating Disorders*. Zenodo. doi:10.5281/zenodo.7101682.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring that I include the dataset's name, description, and the full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture the relevant information regarding the dataset used in the research paper.
