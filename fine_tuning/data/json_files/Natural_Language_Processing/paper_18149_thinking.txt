To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A comprehensive study on fidelity metrics for XAI" by Miquel Miró-Nicolau et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study involves public datasets comprising 52,000 images, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experimental setup)**, particularly the **subsection 4.3 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention two datasets:

1. **AIXI-Shape Dataset**: This dataset consists of 52,000 images of 128 by 128 pixels, featuring simple geometric shapes on a black background. The authors provide a detailed description of how the labels for the images are calculated.

2. **TXUXIv3 Dataset**: This dataset is an extension of the AIXI-Shape dataset, also containing 52,000 images. However, it features a non-uniform background selected from the Describable Textures Dataset, which allows for increased out-of-domain sample generation.

Both datasets are made publicly available by the authors at a specified GitHub link, which is crucial for citation purposes.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For the **AIXI-Shape Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Miquel Miró-Nicolau, Antoni Jaume-i-Capó, and Gabriel Moyà-Alcover. *A novel approach to generate datasets with XAI ground truth to evaluate image models*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2302.05624, 2023.

- For the **TXUXIv3 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Miquel Miró-Nicolau, Antoni Jaume-i-Capó, and Gabriel Moyà-Alcover. *Assessing Fidelity in XAI post-hoc techniques: A Comparative Study with Ground Truth Explanations Datasets*. arXiv:2311.01961, 2023.

With these citations in hand, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the study, ready for further processing or review.
