To extract datasets from the research paper titled "V2X-PC: Vehicle-to-everything Collaborative Perception via Point Cluster" by Si Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions experiments on "two widely recognized collaborative perception benchmarks," which indicates that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets and Evaluation Metrics)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention:

1. **DAIR-V2X-C**: This dataset is described as a large-scale collection of real-world scenarios for vehicle-infrastructure collaborative autonomous driving, containing 38,845 frames of point cloud data annotated with almost 464k 3D bounding boxes representing objects in 10 different classes.

2. **V2XSet**: This dataset is noted as a large-scale V2X perception dataset founded on CARLA and OpenCDA, consisting of 11,447 frames captured in 55 representative simulation scenes that cover common driving scenarios.

I will then verify the details of these datasets in the **experiments section** to confirm their usage in the authors' evaluations. The authors indeed utilize both datasets for their experiments, which solidifies their relevance.

Now, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for these datasets:

- For **DAIR-V2X-C**, the citation is:
  > H. Yu, Y. Luo, M. Shu, Y. Huo, Z. Yang, Y. Shi, Z. Guo, H. Li, X. Hu, J. Yuan et al. "DAIR-V2X: A large-scale dataset for vehicle-infrastructure cooperative 3D object detection." In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2022, pp. 21 361–21 370.

- For **V2XSet**, the citation is:
  > R. Xu, H. Xiang, Z. Tu, X. Xia, M.-H. Yang, and J. Ma. "V2XSet: Vehicle-to-everything cooperative perception with vision transformer." In European Conference on Computer Vision, 2022, pp. 107–124.

With this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes its full citation. This will prepare the dataset information for further processing or review.
