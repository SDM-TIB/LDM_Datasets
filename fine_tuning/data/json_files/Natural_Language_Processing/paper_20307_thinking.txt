To extract datasets from the research paper titled "LMStyle Benchmark: Evaluating Text Style Transfer for Chatbots" by Jianlin Chen, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the LMStyle Benchmark and mentions evaluating popular LLMs, which suggests that datasets are involved in the evaluation process.

Next, I will look into **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the author describes the experimental setup. Here, I will find specific mentions of datasets used for evaluation. The author states that they adopted two widely used dialogue datasets: **Daily Dialog** and **Blended Skill Talk**. This is a clear indication that these datasets are central to the experiments.

I will then check the **References section** to gather the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with sources for further exploration.

1. **Daily Dialog**: The citation is:
   > Li, Y., Su, H., Shen, X., Li, W., Cao, Z., & Niu, S. (2017). DailyDialog: A manually labelled multi-turn dialogue dataset. In Proceedings of the Eighth International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing (Volume 1: Long Papers), pages 986–995, Taipei, Taiwan. Asian Federation of Natural Language Processing.

2. **Blended Skill Talk**: The citation is:
   > Smith, E. M., Williamson, M., Shuster, K., Weston, J., & Boureau, Y.-L. (2020). Can you put it all together: Evaluating conversational agents’ ability to blend skills. In Proceedings of the 58th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, pages 2021–2030, Online. Association for Computational Linguistics.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, which is essential for understanding the context and validity of the experiments conducted in the paper.
