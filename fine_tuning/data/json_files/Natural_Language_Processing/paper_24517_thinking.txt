To extract datasets from the research paper titled "AI Cards: Towards an Applied Framework for Machine-Readable AI and Risk Documentation Inspired by the EU AI Act" by Delaram Golpayegani et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the need for documentation of high-risk AI systems, which may imply the use of specific datasets, but I need to confirm this in the main body of the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **sections that describe the methodology and experiments**. In this paper, the authors mention an illustrative example of an AI-based student proctoring system called **Proctify**. I will look for any datasets used in this context, particularly in the sections discussing the development and validation of the AI Cards framework.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention the **SusBehavedDataset**, which is used to train the model for the Proctify system. This dataset is crucial for understanding the performance and risks associated with the AI system.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the SusBehavedDataset. If the dataset is not explicitly cited in the references, I will note that it may require further investigation or direct contact with the authors for proper attribution.

The citation for the SusBehavedDataset is not provided in the paper, so I will summarize the information I have gathered about it:

- **SusBehavedDataset**: This dataset is used for training the SusBehavedModel in the Proctify system. It is essential for detecting suspicious behavior during online exams.

Since I have identified the dataset and its context, I will now compile the information into a structured format for clarity and future reference.

In summary, I have extracted the following dataset from the paper:

1. **SusBehavedDataset**: Used in the Proctify system for training purposes related to detecting suspicious behavior during online exams.

I will ensure to document this dataset appropriately, noting that the full citation was not available in the paper and may need to be sourced directly from the authors or related publications.
