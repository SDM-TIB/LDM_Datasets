To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Transformer-based Model with Self-distillation for Multimodal Emotion Recognition in Conversations" by Hui Ma et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental settings sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that experiments were conducted on the **IEMOCAP** and **MELD** datasets, which indicates that these are the datasets of interest.

Next, I will look for more detailed descriptions of these datasets in the **experimental settings section**. In this section, the authors provide statistics for both datasets:

1. **IEMOCAP**: This dataset consists of 120 conversations with a total of 5810 utterances for training and validation, and 1623 utterances for testing. It includes six emotion classes: happy, sad, neutral, angry, excited, and frustrated.

2. **MELD**: This dataset contains 1153 conversations with 11098 utterances for training and validation, and 2610 utterances for testing. It includes seven emotion classes: neutral, surprise, fear, sadness, joy, disgust, and anger.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **IEMOCAP**, the citation is:
  > Busso, C., Bulut, M., Lee, C.-C., Kazemzadeh, A., Mower, E., Kim, S., Chang, J. N., Lee, S., & Narayanan, S. S. (2008). *IEMOCAP: Interactive emotional dyadic motion capture database*. Language Resources and Evaluation, 42(4), 335-359.

- For **MELD**, the citation is:
  > Poria, S., Hazarika, D., Majumder, N., Naik, G., Cambria, E., & Mihalcea, R. (2019). *MELD: A multimodal multi-party dataset for emotion recognition in conversations*. In Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (pp. 527-536).

With this information, I can now summarize the datasets in a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will allow for proper referencing in any subsequent analysis or application of the research findings.
