To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Center-Sensitive Kernel Optimization for Efficient On-Device Incremental Learning" by Dingwen Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction typically outlines the context and significance of the study, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental setup section** where the authors usually detail the datasets used for their experiments. In this paper, the authors mention evaluating their method on two datasets: **CIFAR-100** and **TinyImageNet**. I will note down the specific details provided about these datasets, including their characteristics and the number of classes and images.

In the **experimental results section**, I will look for any additional context or insights regarding the datasets, such as how they were utilized in the experiments or any specific configurations that were applied.

After gathering the necessary information about the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the sources for further exploration.

For the **CIFAR-100 dataset**, the citation is:
> Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton, et al. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. 2009.

For the **TinyImageNet dataset**, the citation is:
> Ya Le and Xuan Yang. *Tiny ImageNet Visual Recognition Challenge*. CS 231N, 7(7):3, 2015.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset along with its citation. This will ensure that the datasets are properly documented and can be easily referenced in future work or research.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for review or further processing, ensuring that all relevant details are included and accurately represented.
