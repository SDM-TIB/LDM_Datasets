To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Benchmarking Sensitivity of Continual Graph Learning for Skeleton-Based Action Recognition" by Wei Wei et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the datasets used in the study. The abstract mentions that the benchmark is based on the **N-UCLA** and **NTU-RGB+D** datasets for skeleton-based action recognition. This indicates that these datasets are central to the research.

Next, I will look into **section 4 (Experiment Setup)**, specifically **subsection 4.2 (Datasets)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used. Here, I will find the following information:

1. **N-UCLA Dataset**: The authors describe it as covering primitive movements, with a total of 1,484 action sequences, 20 joints, and 10 classes. This dataset is crucial for their experiments.

2. **NTU-RGB+D Dataset**: This dataset is noted for covering daily activities, with 6,667 action sequences, 25 joints, and also 10 classes. The authors specify that they only used the first 10 classes from this dataset to align with the N-UCLA dataset for their class-incremental learning variant.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for both datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For the **N-UCLA Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Wang, J., Nie, X., Xia, Y., Wu, Y., & Zhu, S. (2014). Cross-view action modeling, learning, and recognition. In *2014 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)*, pages 2649–2656. IEEE Computer Society.

- For the **NTU-RGB+D Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Shahroudy, A., Liu, J., Ng, T., & Wang, G. (2016). NTU RGB+D: A large scale dataset for 3D human activity analysis. In *2016 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)*, pages 1010–1019. IEEE Computer Society.

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations for further processing or review. This structured approach ensures that I accurately capture the datasets and their significance in the research.
