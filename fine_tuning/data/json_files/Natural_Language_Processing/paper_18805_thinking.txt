To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Inference for Two-Stage Extremum Estimators" by Aristide Houndetoungan and Abdoul Haki Maoudeb, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the research uses data from the **National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health)**, which is a significant dataset for the study.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments or application sections**. In the introduction, the authors mention using the Add Health dataset for their empirical application regarding peer effects on adolescent fast-food consumption habits. This is a clear indication that this dataset is central to their research.

In the **application section**, the authors provide detailed information about the Add Health dataset, including its purpose, sample size, and the specific wave of data used (Wave II). They describe the dataset as containing information on adolescents' health and risk behaviors, which is crucial for their analysis.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the Add Health dataset. The citation is typically provided in the context of the dataset's description. The authors mention that the Add Health program was directed by Kathleen Mullan Harris and designed by J. Richard Udry, Peter S. Bearman, and Kathleen Mullan Harris at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, funded by Grant P01-HD31921 from the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development.

The full citation for the dataset is:
> Harris, K. M., Udry, J. R., & Bearman, P. S. (1997). *National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health), 1994-2008*. University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citation for the Add Health dataset as it is crucial for proper attribution and further research.

In summary, the key dataset extracted from the paper is the **National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health)**, with the following citation:
- Harris, K. M., Udry, J. R., & Bearman, P. S. (1997). *National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health), 1994-2008*. University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
