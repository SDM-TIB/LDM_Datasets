To extract datasets from the research paper titled "RETSEG: RETENTION-BASED NETWORK FOR POLYPS SEGMENTATION" by Khaled ELKarazle et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors trained and validated their model using two publicly available datasets: **Kvasir-SEG** and **CVC-ClinicDB**. This is a good starting point, as it explicitly names the datasets.

Next, I will look into the **data collection section** (3.2) where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used. Here, they mention:

1. **Kvasir-SEG**: This dataset consists of 1,000 colonoscopy images with corresponding ground-truth masks, annotated by gastroenterologists. The images vary in resolution from 332x487 to 1920x1072 pixels.

2. **CVC-ClinicDB**: This dataset contains 612 static polyp frames extracted from 31 colonoscopy sequences, all at a resolution of 384 × 288 pixels.

Additionally, the authors mention using several other datasets for testing purposes, which include:

3. **CVC-300**: Comprising 300 images, each with a ground-truth mask, and a resolution of 574 x 500 pixels.

4. **CVC-ColonDB**: This dataset includes 300 static samples, some of which are captured under challenging conditions.

5. **ETIS-LaribPolypDB**: This dataset consists of 196 samples with a resolution of 1225 × 996 pixels.

6. **BKAI-IGH NeoPolyp**: This dataset contains 1,200 samples along with their corresponding ground-truth masks.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations to ensure proper documentation and facilitate further research.
