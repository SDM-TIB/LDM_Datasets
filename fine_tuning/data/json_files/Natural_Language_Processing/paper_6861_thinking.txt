To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "HiVLP: Hierarchical Vision-Language Pre-Training for Fast Image-Text Retrieval" by Feilong Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. In the abstract, the authors refer to evaluating their method on **two popular image-text retrieval benchmarks**, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors mention benchmarks such as **Flickr30k** and **COCO**. This indicates that these datasets are likely used in their experiments, but I need to confirm their details.

In **section 4.1 (Datasets and Implement Details)**, the authors provide a clear list of datasets used for training and evaluation:

1. **COCO (Common Objects in Context)**: This dataset contains 123,000 images and is widely used for image captioning and object detection tasks. Each image is associated with five human-written captions.
   
2. **Flickr30k**: This dataset consists of 31,000 images, with 29,000 for training, 1,000 for validation, and 1,000 for testing. Each image is also associated with five human-written captions.

Additionally, the authors mention using other datasets for training, including **Visual Genome**, **Conceptual Captions**, and **SBU Captions**, but the primary focus for evaluation is on COCO and Flickr30k.

Now, I will check the **References section** to retrieve the full citations for these datasets:

- For **COCO**, the citation is:
  > Lin, T.Y., Maire, M., Belongie, S., Hays, J., Perona, P., Ramanan, D., DollÃ¡r, P., Zitnick, C.L. (2014). *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. In Proceedings of the European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV).

- For **Flickr30k**, the citation is:
  > Plummer, B.A., Wang, L., Cervantes, C.M., Caicedo, J.C., Hockenmaier, J., Lazebnik, S. (2015). *Flickr30k Entities: Collecting Region-to-Phrase Correspondences for Richer Image-to-Sentence Models*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV).

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
