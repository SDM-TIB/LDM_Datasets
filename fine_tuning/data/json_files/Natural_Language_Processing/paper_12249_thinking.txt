To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Exploring Implied Certainty Equivalent Rates in Financial Markets: Empirical Analysis and Application to the Electric Vehicle Industry" by Yifan He and Svetlozar Rachev, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and empirical research sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted empirical research on company stocks and options, which suggests that there may be specific datasets involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention selecting stocks and options from three best-performing and three worst-performing companies for their analysis. This hints at the existence of datasets related to these companies, but I need to find the exact names and details.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Empirical Research)**, where the authors describe their methodology for obtaining data. They mention using historical stock prices from Yahoo Finance and options data from CBOE. However, they do not provide specific dataset names or citations here.

In **section 4 (Application: Electric Vehicle Industry)**, the authors apply their findings to three well-known electric vehicle companies: Tesla, General Motors, and Ford Motor Company. They present data visualizations and summarize the implied certainty equivalent rates for these companies, which indicates that there are datasets related to these companies' stock options.

To summarize the datasets identified:

1. **Best-Performing Companies Dataset**: This dataset includes stock and options data for Apple, Nvidia, and Meta, which were identified as the best-performing companies in 2023. The authors visualize the relationship between time to maturity, moneyness, and the implied certainty equivalent rate for these companies.

2. **Worst-Performing Companies Dataset**: This dataset includes stock and options data for First Republic Bank, Signature Bank, and Charles Schwab, identified as the worst-performing companies. Similar visualizations are provided for these companies as well.

3. **Electric Vehicle Companies Dataset**: This dataset includes stock and options data for Tesla, General Motors, and Ford Motor Company. The authors analyze the implied certainty equivalent rates for these companies and provide visualizations.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned:

- For the **historical stock data**, the authors refer to Yahoo Finance, but they do not provide a specific citation. I will note that this is a commonly used source for financial data.
  
- For the **options data**, they mention CBOE (Chicago Board Options Exchange), which is also a standard source for options data but lacks a specific citation in the paper.

- The authors reference financial news articles and reports for their empirical analysis, but these do not constitute datasets themselves.

Since the paper does not provide formal citations for the datasets, I will note the sources as Yahoo Finance and CBOE for the respective datasets.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries with the relevant information, including the names of the companies involved and the sources of the data, ensuring to highlight the lack of formal citations for the datasets used in the analysis.
