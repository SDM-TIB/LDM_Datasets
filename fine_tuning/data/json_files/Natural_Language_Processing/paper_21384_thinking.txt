To extract datasets from the research paper titled "RL-ViGen: A Reinforcement Learning Benchmark for Visual Generalization" by Zhecheng Yuan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions and may mention key datasets used for evaluation. In this case, the authors introduce a novel benchmark called **RL-ViGen**, which suggests that there are datasets associated with this benchmark.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors discuss existing benchmarks and highlight the limitations of current datasets. They mention several benchmarks like **Procgen**, **Distracting Control Suite**, and **DMC-GB**, which indicates that these are relevant datasets in the context of visual reinforcement learning.

Moving on to the **experiments section**, I will look for specific mentions of datasets used in their experiments. The authors describe various environments and tasks, such as **Adroit**, **CARLA**, **Habitat**, and **Robosuite**, which are likely associated with specific datasets. I will note down these environments as they often correspond to datasets used for training and evaluation.

In the **environment section**, the authors provide detailed descriptions of the environments used in RL-ViGen. Here, I will extract the following datasets:

1. **Adroit**: This environment is tailored for dexterous hand manipulation tasks. The authors reference the original paper for this dataset:
   > Rajeswaran, A., Kumar, V., Gupta, A., Vezzani, G., Schulman, J., & Levine, S. (2017). Learning complex dexterous manipulation with deep reinforcement learning and demonstrations. arXiv preprint arXiv:1709.10087.

2. **CARLA**: A high-fidelity simulator for autonomous driving. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Dosovitskiy, A., Ros, G., Codevilla, F., Lopez, A., & Koltun, V. (2017). CARLA: An open urban driving simulator. In Conference on Robot Learning (CoRL).

3. **Habitat**: A platform for embodied AI research, which includes various visual navigation tasks. The citation is:
   > Savva, M., Kadian, A., Maksymets, O., Zhao, Y., Wijmans, E., Jain, B., ... & Batra, D. (2019). Habitat: A platform for embodied AI research. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV).

4. **Robosuite**: A modular simulation framework for robot learning. The citation is:
   > Zhu, Y., Wong, J., Mandlekar, A., Martín-Martín, R., Joshi, A., Nasiriany, S., & Zhu, Y. (2020). Robosuite: A modular simulation framework and benchmark for robot learning. arXiv preprint arXiv:2009.12293.

After identifying these datasets and their corresponding citations, I will ensure that I have the correct format for each citation as they will be crucial for any downstream processing or documentation.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ready for further use or analysis.
