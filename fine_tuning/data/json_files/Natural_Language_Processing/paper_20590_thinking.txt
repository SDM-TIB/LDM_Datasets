To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Spatio-Temporal Proximity-Aware Dual-Path Model for Panoramic Activity Recognition" by Sumin Lee et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the **JRDB-PAR dataset**, which indicates that this dataset is likely important for the research.

Next, I will examine **section 4.1 (Dataset and Metrics)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention the **JRDB-PAR dataset** specifically, describing it as an extension of the JRDB and JRDB-act datasets. They provide details about the dataset, including the number of videos, action classes, and the total number of frames and bounding boxes.

The authors also reference the JRDB dataset and JRDB-act dataset in this section, which suggests that these datasets are also relevant to their work. I will need to gather full citations for all three datasets mentioned.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the complete citations for each dataset:

1. **JRDB-PAR Dataset**:
   > Ehsanpour, M., Saleh, F., Savarese, S., Reid, I., & Rezatofighi, H. (2022). *JRDB-act: A large-scale dataset for spatio-temporal action, social group and activity detection*. In Proceedings of IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 20983–20992.

2. **JRDB Dataset**:
   > Martin-Martin, R., Patel, M., Rezatofighi, H., Shenoi, A., Gwak, J., Frankel, E., Sadeghian, A., & Savarese, S. (2021). *JRDB: A dataset and benchmark of egocentric robot visual perception of humans in built environments*. IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence.

3. **JRDB-act Dataset**:
   > Ehsanpour, M., Abedin, A., Saleh, F., Shi, J., Reid, I., & Rezatofighi, H. (2020). *Joint learning of social groups, individuals action and sub-group activities in videos*. In Proceedings of European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), pages 177–195.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

- **JRDB-PAR Dataset**: A dataset specifically designed for panoramic activity recognition, containing multi-person scenes captured by a mobile robot, with 27 videos and over 628k human bounding boxes.
  
- **JRDB Dataset**: A foundational dataset for egocentric robot visual perception, providing a benchmark for understanding human interactions in built environments.

- **JRDB-act Dataset**: A dataset focused on spatio-temporal action detection, which includes various social group activities.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that each dataset is clearly identified with its full citation.
