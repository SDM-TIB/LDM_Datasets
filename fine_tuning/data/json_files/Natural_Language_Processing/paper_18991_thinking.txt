To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A survey of recent methods for addressing AI fairness and bias in biomedicine" by Yifan Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets along with their full citations.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors surveyed recent publications on debiasing methods in biomedical NLP and computer vision, which suggests that there may be datasets referenced in the context of these methods.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **Materials and Methods** section, as this is where the authors typically describe their literature search and any datasets they may have used or referenced. I will pay close attention to any tables or figures that might summarize datasets.

In **Table 2**, the authors list several publicly available fairness research datasets that contain demographic information. The datasets mentioned include:

1. **CheXpert**: A large chest radiograph dataset with uncertainty labels and expert comparison.
2. **MIMIC Chest X-Ray**: A large publicly available database of labeled chest radiographs.
3. **ChestX-ray8**: A hospital-scale chest X-ray database for weakly-supervised classification and localization of common thorax diseases.
4. **UK Biobank**: A cardiovascular magnetic resonance protocol dataset.
5. **RadFusion**: A dataset for benchmarking performance and fairness for multimodal pulmonary embolism detection from CT and EHR.
6. **PaPILa**: A dataset with fundus images and clinical data for glaucoma assessment.
7. **HAM10000**: A large collection of multi-source dermatoscopic images of common pigmented skin lesions.
8. **EchoNet-Pediatric**: A dataset for automated assessment of left ventricular ejection fraction in pediatric patients.
9. **COVID-CT-MD**: A dataset of COVID-19 computed tomography scans applicable in machine learning and deep learning.
10. **ISIC 2020**: A patient-centric dataset for identifying melanomas using clinical context.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset from the **References section** of the paper. This is crucial for ensuring that I have the correct and complete citations for each dataset.

The citations for the datasets are as follows:

With all this information gathered, I will now compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
