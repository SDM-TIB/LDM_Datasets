To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Augmenting Text for Spoken Language Understanding with Large Language Models" by Roshan Sharma et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the datasets referenced. The abstract mentions the use of the **STOP dataset** for experiments, which indicates that this dataset is significant for the research.

Next, I will look for specific sections that detail the datasets used, particularly **section 5 (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors discuss the **STOP dataset** in detail. In this section, they describe the dataset as a public dataset with real speech for spoken semantic parsing, containing data for 8 domains, 28 unique intents, and 82 slot types. This confirms that the STOP dataset is a primary dataset used in their experiments.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the STOP dataset. The citation provided in the references is:
> P. Tomasello, A. Shrivastava, D. Lazar, P.-C. Hsu, D. Le, A. Sagar, A. Elkahky, J. Copet, W.-N. Hsu, Y. Adi, et al., “STOP: A dataset for spoken task oriented semantic parsing,” in Proc. SLT, 2023, pp. 991–998.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets explicitly, I will focus solely on the STOP dataset for my extraction.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the STOP dataset as it is crucial for proper referencing.

In summary, the key steps I took include:
1. Reading the abstract and introduction for initial mentions of datasets.
2. Identifying the relevant section (section 5) that discusses the datasets in detail.
3. Retrieving the full citation for the STOP dataset from the references.

With this information, I will prepare the dataset entry for the STOP dataset, ensuring it is ready for further processing or review.
