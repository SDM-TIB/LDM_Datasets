To extract datasets from the research paper titled "EMAG: Ego-motion Aware and Generalizable 2D Hand Forecasting from Egocentric Videos" by Masashi Hatano et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. In the abstract, the authors mention that they conducted experiments on two large-scale egocentric video datasets: **Ego4D** and **EPIC-Kitchens 55**. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for the research and should be included in my extraction.

Next, I will look into **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used in their experiments. Here, I will find specific information about each dataset, including their characteristics and the context in which they were used.

1. **Ego4D**: The paper describes Ego4D as a large-scale egocentric video dataset containing 3,670 hours of video footage of people performing various tasks across different locations. This dataset is significant for the proposed method, as it provides diverse scenarios for training and evaluation.

2. **EPIC-Kitchens 55**: This dataset consists of 432 egocentric videos recorded by participants in their kitchens, focusing on daily activities. The authors mention that they used the train/val split provided by RUL-STM, which is essential for understanding how the dataset was utilized in their experiments.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper to gather the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily.

- For **Ego4D**, the citation is:
  > Kristen Grauman et al. *Ego4D: Around the world in 3,000 hours of egocentric video*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2022.

- For **EPIC-Kitchens 55**, the citation is:
  > Dima Damen et al. *Scaling egocentric vision: The epic-kitchens dataset*. In Proceedings of the European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), 2018.

Now that I have gathered all necessary information about the datasets, I will summarize the findings, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
