To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Classification Benchmarks for Under-resourced Bengali Language based on Multichannel Convolutional-LSTM Network" by Md. Rezaul Karim et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors prepared three datasets for hate speech detection, document classification, and sentiment analysis. This is a strong indication that I will find detailed descriptions of these datasets later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Datasets)**, where the authors provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets they created. I will look for specific names, descriptions, and any statistics related to each dataset. The paper mentions three datasets:

1. **Hate Speech Dataset**: This dataset contains 35,000 statements categorized into political, religious, gender abusive, geopolitical, and personal hate speech. The authors provide statistics on the number of statements and words in each category.

2. **Document Classification Dataset**: This dataset consists of 376,226 documents categorized into five topics: state, economy, international, entertainment, and sports. The authors provide detailed statistics about the number of documents and words in each category.

3. **Sentiment Analysis Dataset**: This dataset includes 320,000 reviews categorized as either positive or negative. The authors also provide statistics on the number of statements and words in each category.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations related to these datasets. The authors may not provide specific citations for the datasets they created, but they do reference related works that may be useful for context.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the paper itself, as it is crucial for proper attribution. The citation for the paper is:

> Md. Rezaul Karim, Bharathi Raja Chakravarthi, John P. McCrae, and Michael Cochez. *Classification Benchmarks for Under-resourced Bengali Language based on Multichannel Convolutional-LSTM Network*. In Proceedings of the 10th ACM International Conference on Bioinformatics, Computational Biology and Health Informatics, 2019.

With this information, I will summarize the datasets and their descriptions, ensuring that I include the necessary details for each dataset along with the citation for the paper. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.
