To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SIAM: A Simple Alternating Mixer for Video Prediction" by Xin Zheng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information and provide full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the proposed method is evaluated on "four benchmark video datasets," which indicates that there are specific datasets used for the experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section IV), where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for evaluation. They mention four datasets:

1. **Moving MNIST (M-MNIST)**: This dataset consists of sequences of two digits that move randomly and bounce off the boundaries. It is commonly used for testing video prediction algorithms.

2. **TaxiBJ**: This dataset records traffic flow trajectories in Beijing, capturing the inflow and outflow of each region at corresponding pixels with two channels.

3. **WeatherBench**: This dataset includes physical quantities such as temperature, humidity, and wind, and is used for weather forecasting tasks.

4. **Human3.6M**: A high-resolution RGB video dataset that contains complex human poses captured in various real-world scenarios.

To ensure accuracy, I will also check the **References section** for full citations of these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **Moving MNIST (M-MNIST)**, the citation is:

- For **TaxiBJ**, the citation is:

- For **WeatherBench**, the citation is:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
