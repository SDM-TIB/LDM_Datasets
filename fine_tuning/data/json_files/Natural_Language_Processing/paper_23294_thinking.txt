To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Large Language Models Enhanced Sequential Recommendation for Long-tail User and Item" by Qidong Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the research context and any datasets that may be referenced. The abstract mentions that experiments were conducted on three authentic datasets, which indicates that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any relevant sections that discuss the datasets used in the experiments. In this case, the **Experiments section** provides a clear overview of the datasets utilized. The paper mentions three datasets: **Yelp**, **Fashion**, and **Beauty**.

1. **Yelp Dataset**: This dataset records the check-in histories and corresponding reviews of users. The authors specify that they only adopt the check-in data and the attribute information of the points of interest.

2. **Fashion Dataset**: This dataset is a subset of the Amazon dataset, which includes user reviews on commodities. The authors mention that they use specific subcategories from this dataset.

3. **Beauty Dataset**: Similar to the Fashion dataset, this is another subset of the Amazon dataset, focusing on beauty products.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

- For the **Yelp dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yelp. *Yelp Dataset Challenge*. Available at: https://www.yelp.com/dataset.

- For the **Amazon Fashion dataset**, the citation is:
  > J. McAuley and J. Leskovec. *Image-based recommendations on styles and substitutes*. In Proceedings of the 38th International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval, 2015, pp. 43-52.

- For the **Amazon Beauty dataset**, the citation is:
  > J. McAuley and J. Leskovec. *Image-based recommendations on styles and substitutes*. In Proceedings of the 38th International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval, 2015, pp. 43-52.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or processing. This will ensure that the datasets are accurately represented and properly cited in any subsequent work or analysis.
