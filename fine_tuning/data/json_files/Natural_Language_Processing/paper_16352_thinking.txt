To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Transformer-QEC: Quantum Error Correction Code Decoding with Transferable Transformers" by Hanrui Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract discusses the evaluation of the proposed Transformer-QEC model across various code distances and error configurations, which suggests that datasets related to these evaluations may be present.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **methodology** and **evaluation** sections. In the methodology, the authors describe their experimental setup, including the use of a dataset of 1,000,000 samples with a 1% error rate. This indicates that there is a dataset used for training the model.

I will also check the **evaluation methodology** section, where the authors mention benchmarks and physical error rates. They specifically refer to the rotated surface code with distances of 3, 5, 7, and 9, and they describe the phenomenological error model used for their experiments. However, they do not explicitly name a dataset for these benchmarks, which suggests that the dataset used for training may be the same as the one mentioned earlier.

Now, I will consult the **references section** to find any citations related to the datasets mentioned. The authors do not provide specific citations for the datasets used in their experiments, but they do reference other works that may have datasets relevant to quantum error correction.

Based on my findings, I will document the dataset as follows:

1. **Dataset Name**: Quantum Error Correction Dataset
   - **Description**: A dataset containing 1,000,000 samples used for training the Transformer-QEC model, with a focus on quantum error correction across various code distances and error configurations.
   - **Citation**: The dataset is not explicitly cited in the paper, but it is derived from the experimental setup described by the authors.

Since the paper does not provide specific external datasets or their citations, I will note that the dataset is primarily constructed for the purposes of this research and does not have a formal citation.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format for clarity and future reference, ensuring that I include the necessary details about the dataset and its context within the research.
