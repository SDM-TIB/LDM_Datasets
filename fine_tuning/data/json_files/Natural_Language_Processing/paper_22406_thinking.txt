To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CodeFort: Robust Training for Code Generation Models" by Yuhao Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the use of a framework called CodeFort to improve the robustness of code generation models, but it does not specify any datasets. The introduction discusses the challenges faced by code generation models but does not explicitly mention datasets either.

Next, I will look into **section 5 (Evaluation)**, where the authors describe their experimental setup. Here, they mention using the **stack dataset (v1.2)** as their raw training dataset. This is a clear indication of a dataset being utilized in their research.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the stack dataset. The citation provided in the references is:
> Kocetkov, D., Li, R., Ben Allal, L., Li, J., Mou, C., Muñoz Ferrandis, C., Jernite, Y., Mitchell, M., Hughes, S., Wolf, T., Bahdanau, D., von Werra, L., and de Vries, H. *The stack: 3 tb of permissively licensed source code*. Preprint, 2022.

Additionally, the paper mentions the **ReCode benchmark** for evaluating robustness, which is based on HumanEval and MBPP datasets. I will also look for the citation for the ReCode benchmark in the references.

The citation for the ReCode benchmark is:
> Wang, S., Li, Z., Qian, H., Yang, C., Wang, Z., Shang, M., Kumar, V., Tan, S., Ray, B., Bhatia, P., Nallapati, R., Ramanathan, M. K., Roth, D., and Xiang, B. *Recode: Robustness evaluation of code generation models*. In Proceedings of the 61st Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers), ACL 2023, Toronto, Canada, July 9-14, 2023, pp. 13818–13843. Association for Computational Linguistics, 2023.

Now, I have identified two datasets:

1. **Stack Dataset (v1.2)**: Used as the raw training dataset.
2. **ReCode Benchmark**: Used for evaluating robustness.

I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations, ensuring that the information is clear and complete for future reference or processing.
