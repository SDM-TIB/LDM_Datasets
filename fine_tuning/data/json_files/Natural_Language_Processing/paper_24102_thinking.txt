To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multilingual Large Language Models and Curse of Multilinguality" by Daniil Gurgurov et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and technical sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a general overview, but I will focus on sections that are likely to contain specific dataset information, such as the **Technicalities** and **Pre-training data** sections.

In the **Technicalities section**, the authors discuss various multilingual large language models (LLMs) and their training data sources. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets used for training these models.

Next, in the **Pre-training data** subsection, the authors list several datasets that are utilized for training multilingual LLMs. The following datasets are mentioned:

1. **Wikipedia**: This dataset includes cleaned articles in various languages sourced from Wikipedia dumps. Each language has a separate subset, representing entire articles.

2. **Common Crawl (CC) Corpus**: A vast collection of web data accumulated over more than 10 years through web crawling, including raw web page data and text extracts in numerous languages.

3. **ROOTS**: A comprehensive dataset developed by the BigScience workshop, focusing on ethical considerations in LLMs, spanning 1.6 terabytes.

4. **OSCAR**: An open-source initiative providing web-based multilingual data for ML and AI applications, focusing on improving data quality for low-resource languages.

5. **WebText2**: An improved version of the original OpenWebTextCorpus, covering Reddit posts and contributing to the training material for multilingual models.

6. **Books1 and Books2**: Internet-based book corpora featuring a random sampling of public domain books and modern literature, used for pre-training models like GPT-3.

After identifying these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with sources for further exploration.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
