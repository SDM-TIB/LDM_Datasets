To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ViSoBERT: A Pre-Trained Language Model for Vietnamese Social Media" by Quoc-Nam Nguyen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluated their model on five important natural language downstream tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments** section. In this paper, the authors describe their pre-training data and the datasets used for downstream tasks in **section 4 (Experiments and Results)**. Here, they mention five specific datasets:

1. **UIT-VSMEC**: This dataset is used for emotion recognition tasks. The authors reference the work by Ho et al. (2020) for this dataset.
2. **UIT-ViHSD**: This dataset is for hate speech detection, with a citation to Luu et al. (2021).
3. **SA-VLSP2016**: This dataset is used for sentiment analysis, and the authors cite Nguyen et al. (2018) for it.
4. **ViSpamReviews**: This dataset is for spam reviews detection, with a reference to Dinh et al. (2022).
5. **UIT-ViHOS**: This dataset is for hate speech spans detection, with a citation to Hoang et al. (2023).

I will now gather the full citations for each of these datasets from the **References section** of the paper:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations.
