To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Single- and Multi-Agent Private Active Sensing: A Deep Neuroevolution Approach" by George Stamatelis et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, but I will need to delve deeper into the main body of the paper for specific dataset information.

Next, I will examine **section III (Deep Neuroevolution Schemes for EAHT)** and **section IV (Numerical Results and Discussion)**, as these sections often contain details about the datasets used for experiments and evaluations. I will look for any mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

In the **numerical results section**, the authors discuss performance evaluations and comparisons with existing methods. If they reference any datasets used for these evaluations, I will note them down. 

I will also check the **references section** for any citations that might correspond to datasets. If the authors refer to datasets from previous works, I will ensure to capture the full citation for those datasets.

After reviewing the relevant sections, I will compile the identified datasets along with their full citations. For instance, if the paper mentions a dataset like "Penn Action Dataset," I will find the corresponding citation in the references section and document it.

Finally, I will summarize the findings, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described with its full citation, as this is crucial for proper attribution and further research.

By following this structured approach, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets referenced in the paper.
