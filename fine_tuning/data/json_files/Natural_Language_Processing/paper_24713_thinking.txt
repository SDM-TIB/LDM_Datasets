To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Benchmarking Predictive Coding Networks â€“ Made Simple" by Luca Pinchetti et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors perform extensive benchmarks using multiple algorithms on various datasets, which indicates that datasets are likely discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **experiments**. In this paper, the relevant section is **section 4 (Experiments and Benchmarks)**, where the authors describe their experimental setup and the datasets used for evaluation.

In this section, I will identify the datasets mentioned:

1. **MNIST**: A well-known dataset for handwritten digit classification, consisting of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images.
2. **FashionMNIST**: A dataset consisting of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images of clothing items, serving as a more challenging alternative to MNIST.
3. **CIFAR-10**: A dataset containing 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes, with 6,000 images per class.
4. **CIFAR-100**: Similar to CIFAR-10 but with 100 classes containing 600 images each.
5. **CelebA**: A large-scale face attributes dataset with over 200,000 celebrity images, each annotated with 40 attribute labels.
6. **Tiny ImageNet**: A smaller version of the ImageNet dataset, containing 100,000 images across 200 classes.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- **MNIST**: 
  > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Chris Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998.

- **FashionMNIST**: 
  > Han Xiao, Kashif Rasul, and Leonid Van Hoof. *Fashion-MNIST: A Novel Image Dataset for Benchmarking Machine Learning Algorithms*. 2017.

- **CIFAR-10**: 
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. *CIFAR-10: The CIFAR-10 Dataset*. 2009.

- **CIFAR-100**: 
  > Alex Krizhevsky. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009.

- **CelebA**: 
  > Ziwei Liu, Ping Luo, Xiaogang Wang, and Xiaoou Tang. *Deep Learning Face Attributes in the Wild*. 2015.

- **Tiny ImageNet**: 
  > Vaishaal Shankar, et al. *Tiny ImageNet Challenge*. 2017.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured all relevant datasets and their sources from the paper.
