To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning from small data sets: Patch-based regularizers in inverse problems for image reconstruction" by Moritz Piening et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of methods from machine learning for image reconstruction, which may imply the use of datasets, but I need to find specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention using the **LoDoPaB dataset** for low-dose computed tomography (CT) imaging. This is a clear indication of a dataset being utilized.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the LoDoPaB dataset. The authors reference the dataset as follows:
> J. Leuschner, M. Schmidt, D. O. Baguer, and P. Maass. *LoDoPaB-CT, a benchmark dataset for low-dose computed tomography reconstruction*. Scientific Data, 8(109), 2021.

Additionally, I will look for any other datasets mentioned throughout the paper. In the **super-resolution section**, the authors refer to the **BSD68 dataset** for zero-shot super-resolution tasks. This is another dataset that needs to be cited.

I will again check the references for the BSD68 dataset citation:
> D. Martin, C. Fowlkes, D. Tal, and J. Malik. *A database of human segmented natural images and its application to evaluating segmentation algorithms and measuring ecological statistics*. IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision, pages 416–423, 2001.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will summarize the findings:

1. **LoDoPaB dataset**: Used for low-dose CT imaging.
   - Citation: J. Leuschner, M. Schmidt, D. O. Baguer, and P. Maass. *LoDoPaB-CT, a benchmark dataset for low-dose computed tomography reconstruction*. Scientific Data, 8(109), 2021.

2. **BSD68 dataset**: Used for zero-shot super-resolution.
   - Citation: D. Martin, C. Fowlkes, D. Tal, and J. Malik. *A database of human segmented natural images and its application to evaluating segmentation algorithms and measuring ecological statistics*. IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision, pages 416–423, 2001.

With this information, I can now compile the dataset entries for further processing or review.
