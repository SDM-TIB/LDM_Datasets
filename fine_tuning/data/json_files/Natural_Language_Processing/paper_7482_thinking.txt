To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Benchmarking Azerbaijani Neural Machine Translation" by Chih-Chen Chen and William Chen, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors benchmark the performance of Azerbaijani-English NMT systems on various datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be discussed later in the paper.

Next, I will examine the **experimental setup** section, particularly focusing on the subsections where datasets are likely to be detailed. In **section 3.1**, the authors mention using the **WikiMatrix dataset**, which consists of 276k parallel sentences for their segmentation algorithm experiments. They also provide a cleaned version of this dataset, filtered to 70,725 sentences. This dataset is crucial for understanding their methodology.

In **section 3.3**, the authors describe their evaluation across several domains and list multiple datasets sourced from **OPUS**. They mention the following datasets:
1. **WikiMatrix** (filtered with a LASER score threshold of 1.04)
2. **CCMatrix**
3. **Tatoeba**
4. **ELRC public corpora**
5. **Tanzil**
6. **GNOME**
7. **QED**
8. **TED2020**
9. **XLEnt**

The total number of sentences across these datasets is also provided, which is important for understanding the scale of their experiments.

Now, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. The citations are as follows:

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and cited according to the findings in the paper. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.
