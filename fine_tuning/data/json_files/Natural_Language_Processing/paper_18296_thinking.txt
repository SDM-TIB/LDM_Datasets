To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CompactifAI: Extreme Compression of Large Language Models using Quantum-Inspired Tensor Networks" by Andrei Tomut et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and benchmark sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of a benchmark to demonstrate the effectiveness of the CompactifAI method, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The introduction discusses the challenges of large language models (LLMs) and the need for efficient solutions, but it does not specify any datasets.

Moving on to the **methodology section**, I will look for any references to datasets used for training or evaluation. Here, I find that the authors mention using two well-known open-source datasets for benchmarking their method: **XSum** and **Gigaword**. This is a crucial finding, as it indicates the datasets utilized in their experiments.

In the **benchmark section**, the authors provide additional context about how these datasets were used. They state that both the original and compressed models underwent additional training for a limited number of epochs using the XSum and Gigaword datasets. This confirms their role in the evaluation of the proposed method.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the **References section** of the paper. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **XSum**, the citation is:
  > Narayan, S., Cohen, S., & Lapata, M. (2018). *Text Summarization with Pretrained Encoders*. In Proceedings of the 56th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL), pages 1-10.

- For **Gigaword**, the citation is:
  > Graff, D., & Cieri, C. (2003). *The Linguistic Data Consortium Gigaword Corpus*. Linguistic Data Consortium.

With these citations in hand, I will now compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ready for review or further processing.
