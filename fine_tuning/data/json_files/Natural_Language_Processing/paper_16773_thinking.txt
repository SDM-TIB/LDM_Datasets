To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Rethinking Skip Connections in Spiking Neural Networks with Time-To-First-Spike Coding" by Youngeun Kim et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that experiments were conducted on public datasets, specifically **MNIST** and **Fashion-MNIST**. This indicates that these datasets are likely to be discussed in more detail later in the paper.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (section 4) to find specific details about how these datasets were used. In section 4.1, the authors provide implementation details and confirm that they evaluated their method on both **MNIST** and **Fashion-MNIST** datasets. They mention training the model with these datasets, which reinforces their significance in the experiments.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The MNIST dataset is widely known, but it is still important to provide the citation as it appears in the literature. The citation for the MNIST dataset is:

- **MNIST Dataset**:
  > Yann LeCun. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/ (1998).

For the **Fashion-MNIST dataset**, the citation is:
- **Fashion-MNIST Dataset**:
  > Han Xiao, Kashif Rasul, and Roland Vollgraf. *Fashion-MNIST: A Novel Image Dataset for Benchmarking Machine Learning Algorithms*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1708.07747 (2017).

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use.

In summary, the datasets extracted from the paper are:
1. **MNIST Dataset** - Citation: Yann LeCun. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/ (1998).
2. **Fashion-MNIST Dataset** - Citation: Han Xiao, Kashif Rasul, and Roland Vollgraf. *Fashion-MNIST: A Novel Image Dataset for Benchmarking Machine Learning Algorithms*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1708.07747 (2017).

With this information, I am ready to present the dataset entries in the required format.
