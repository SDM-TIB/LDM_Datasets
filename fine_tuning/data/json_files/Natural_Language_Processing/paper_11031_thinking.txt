To extract datasets from the research paper titled "BitE: Accelerating Learned Query Optimization in a Mixed-Workload Environment" by Yewon Choi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to gather initial insights about the datasets used. The abstract mentions the introduction of BitE and its application in query optimization, but it does not specify datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Learning Requirements)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for training their model. Here, they provide a detailed list of workloads and datasets, which includes:

1. **JOB Dataset**: This dataset consists of 113 queries from the IMDB dataset, which is an augmentation of the Join Order Benchmark. It is crucial for evaluating query optimization performance.

2. **JOB-light Dataset**: This dataset contains 70 queries with a 6 table-schema, commonly used in cardinality estimation studies.

3. **JOB-light-ranges Dataset**: This dataset includes more complex filters based on the JOB-light dataset.

4. **JOB-M Dataset**: This dataset contains more complicated join conditions, with each query joining 2-11 tables.

5. **JOB-Extended Dataset**: This dataset uses the same relations as JOB but with different semantics.

6. **TPCH Dataset**: A decision support benchmark with 22 queries, which has various scaling factors (e.g., SF1, SF10, SF100).

7. **TPCDS Dataset**: Another decision support benchmark with 99 queries, also featuring different scaling factors.

8. **JCCH Dataset**: A skewed version of the TPCH SF10 schemas, using the same TPCH queries.

9. **STACK Dataset**: A real-world dataset and workload referenced from the Bao paper.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations into a structured format for further processing.
