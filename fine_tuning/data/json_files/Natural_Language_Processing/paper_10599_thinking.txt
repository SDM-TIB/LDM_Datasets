To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CompoundPiece: Evaluating and Improving Decompounding Performance of Language Models" by Benjamin Minixhofer et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors introduce a dataset of 255k compound and non-compound words across 56 languages obtained from Wiktionary. This is a clear indication that a significant dataset is involved.

Next, I will look into the **methodology section**, specifically **section 3 (Methodology)**, where the authors describe how they constructed the dataset. They mention that the dataset includes compound words and their normalized forms, as well as non-compound words, and that it covers 56 languages. This section will provide details about the dataset's composition and its source.

In **section 3.1 (Dataset Construction)**, the authors elaborate on the dataset's creation process, confirming that it is derived from Wiktionary. They also provide statistics about the dataset, including the number of positive (compound) and negative (non-compound) examples across various languages. This section is crucial for understanding the dataset's scope and structure.

I will also check the **experiments section** to see if the dataset is referenced again, particularly in the context of how it was used to evaluate the performance of language models. This will help confirm its relevance and application in the study.

Finally, I will consult the **references section** to find the full citation for the dataset. Since the dataset is based on data from Wiktionary, I will ensure to cite it appropriately. The citation for Wiktionary is as follows:
> Wiktionary contributors. *Wiktionary: The Free Dictionary*. Available at: https://www.wiktionary.org.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and full citation. The dataset entry will look like this:

1. **Dataset Name**: Wiktionary Compound Dataset
   - **Description**: A dataset of 255k compound and non-compound words across 56 languages obtained from Wiktionary, used for evaluating decompounding performance.
   - **Citation**: Wiktionary contributors. *Wiktionary: The Free Dictionary*. Available at: https://www.wiktionary.org.

After gathering all this information, I will ensure that it is presented clearly and accurately for any further processing or review.
