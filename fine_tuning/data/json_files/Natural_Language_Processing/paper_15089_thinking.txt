To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Channel-robust Automatic Modulation Classification Using Spectral Quotient Cumulants" by Sai Huang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract discusses the development of a classification framework but does not explicitly mention datasets. Therefore, I will proceed to the introduction.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the context of automatic modulation classification (AMC) and its relevance to the Internet of Vehicles (IoV). They mention the need for robust classification methods but do not specify any datasets at this point.

Next, I will examine the **methodology and experiments sections**. In these sections, the authors describe their proposed method and the experiments conducted to validate it. They mention using simulation results to demonstrate the performance of their method under various conditions, but they do not explicitly name any datasets.

I will also check the **references section** to see if any datasets are cited indirectly through the works referenced. However, the references primarily focus on previous research and methodologies rather than specific datasets.

After reviewing the entire paper, it appears that the authors did not utilize any publicly available datasets for their experiments. Instead, they conducted simulations based on theoretical models and parameters relevant to their study.

Since no datasets are explicitly mentioned or cited in the paper, I will conclude that there are no datasets to extract or document for this research.

In summary, I will note that while the paper discusses a novel classification framework and presents simulation results, it does not reference any specific datasets used in the research. Therefore, there are no dataset citations to provide.
