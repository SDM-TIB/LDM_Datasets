To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Novel Mathematical Model for Infrastructure Planning of Dynamic Wireless Power Transfer Systems for Electric Vehicles" by Afshin Ghassemi et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus, but I need to look for specific datasets used in the analysis.

Next, I will examine the **methodology section** closely, as it often contains details about the data sources and datasets used for the research. In this paper, the authors discuss a numerical case study, which suggests that there may be specific datasets or data profiles utilized for their analysis.

I will also look for any **tables or figures** that may summarize data or datasets. For instance, in the paper, there is a **Table 3** that presents a data profile for the numerical example, which includes sets, parameters, and variables relevant to the study. This table is crucial as it outlines the specific data used in the case study.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. This is important for proper attribution and to provide readers with the sources of the data.

For example, if the paper references datasets from other studies or publicly available datasets, I will ensure to extract the full citation for each. If the authors created their own datasets, I will note that as well.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, including their names, descriptions, and citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and ease of use.

In summary, my steps will be:
1. Read the abstract, introduction, and methodology sections for mentions of datasets.
2. Examine tables and figures for data profiles.
3. Check the References section for full citations of datasets.
4. Compile the dataset information, including names, descriptions, and citations.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets used in this research paper.
