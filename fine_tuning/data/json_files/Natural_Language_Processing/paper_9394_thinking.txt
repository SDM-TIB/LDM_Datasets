To extract datasets from the research paper titled "In What Languages are Generative Language Models the Most Formal? Analyzing Formality Distribution across Languages" by Asım Ersoy et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** to get an overview of the research focus and any datasets that might be mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors released **6,000 annotated samples**, which suggests that there is a dataset involved.

Next, I will look for specific sections that typically contain dataset information, such as **section 4 (Experiments)** and any dedicated **Datasets** section. In the experiments section, the authors mention using several datasets for their analysis, including:

1. **GYAFC (Grammarly's Yahoo Answers Formality Corpus)**: This dataset is used for English and is a benchmark for formality style transfer. The authors reference the original paper for this dataset.

2. **XFORMAL**: This dataset extends formality style transfer to multiple languages and is mentioned as a source for prompts in the study.

3. **TAOCD (The Arabic Online Commentary Dataset)**: This dataset is used for Arabic and contains informal Arabic with high dialectal content.

4. **InFormal (Indic Formality Evaluation Dataset)**: This dataset includes samples in four Indic languages, including Bengali, and is used for sourcing prompts.

In the **Related Work** section, the authors provide citations for these datasets, which will be crucial for documenting the full citations later.

Now, I will compile the full citations for each dataset from the **References section** of the paper:

- For **GYAFC**, the citation is:
  > Sudha Rao and Joel Tetreault. *Dear sir or madam, may I introduce the GYAFC dataset: Corpus, benchmarks and metrics for formality style transfer*.

- For **XFORMAL**, the citation is:

- For **TAOCD**, the citation is:

- For **InFormal**, the citation is:

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets and their citations in a structured format for easy reference. This will ensure that I have accurately documented the datasets used in the research paper along with their full citations.
