To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-View Conformal Learning for Heterogeneous Sensor Fusion" by Enrique Garcia-Ceja et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and the datasets section (Section 4)** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction typically outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

In **Section 4 (Datasets and Feature Extraction)**, the authors explicitly describe two datasets:

1. **HTAD Dataset**: This dataset consists of wrist-accelerometer and audio data collected from individuals performing seven home activities. The authors provide details about the data collection process, including the number of participants, the activities performed, and the features extracted from the data.

2. **Berkeley MHAD Dataset**: This dataset includes data from various sensors (accelerometers, optical motion capture, microphones, depth sensors, and stereo cameras) recorded while individuals performed eleven actions. The authors also describe the features extracted from this dataset.

Next, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The citations I will extract are:

- For the **HTAD Dataset**:
  > E. Garcia-Ceja, V. Thambawita, S. A. Hicks, D. Jha, P. Jakobsen, H. L. Hammer, P. Halvorsen, M. A. Riegler. *HTAD: A Home-Tasks Activities Dataset with Wrist-Accelerometer and Audio Features*. In MultiMedia Modeling: 27th International Conference, MMM 2021, Prague, Czech Republic, June 22–24, 2021, Proceedings, Part II, pages 196–205, Springer, 2021.

- For the **Berkeley MHAD Dataset**:
  > F. Ofli, R. Chaudhry, G. Kurillo, R. Vidal, R. Bajcsy. *Berkeley MHAD: A Comprehensive Multimodal Human Action Database*. In Applications of Computer Vision (WACV), 2013 IEEE Workshop on, pages 53–60, IEEE, 2013.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their proper citations.
