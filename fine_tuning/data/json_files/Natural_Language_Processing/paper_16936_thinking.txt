To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SSPNet: Scale and spatial priors guided generalizable and interpretable pedestrian attribute recognition" by Jifeng Shen et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that the experimental results demonstrate effectiveness on the **PCS dataset for attribute localization**, which indicates that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Dataset and metrics)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention several datasets:

1. **PA100K dataset**: This dataset consists of 100,000 pedestrian images captured from 598 real outdoor surveillance cameras, annotated with 26 attributes. The authors provide a citation for this dataset.

2. **RAP v1 dataset**: This dataset contains 41,585 pedestrian images from 26 surveillance cameras, with 69 binary attributes. The authors also provide a citation for this dataset.

3. **PETA dataset**: This dataset includes 19,000 pedestrian images with 65 attributes, consisting of 61 binary attributes and 4 multi-class attributes. The citation for this dataset is also provided.

4. **UPAR dataset**: This dataset is designed for pedestrian attribute recognition and person retrieval tasks, unifying several datasets with additional annotations. The authors provide a citation for this dataset.

5. **People Clothing Segmentation (PCS) dataset**: This dataset comprises 1,000 images with corresponding semantic segmentation masks and is used for weakly supervised attribute localization. The citation for this dataset is also included.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to retrieve the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

- For **PA100K dataset**, the citation is:

- For **PETA dataset**, the citation is:
  > Y. Deng, P. Luo, C. C. Loy, X. Tang. *Pedestrian attribute recognition at far distance*. In Proceedings of the 22nd ACM International Conference on Multimedia, 2014, pp. 789–792.

- For **UPAR dataset**, the citation is:
  > A. Specker, M. Cormier, J. Beyerer. *UPAR: Unified pedestrian attribute recognition and person retrieval*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision, 2023, pp. 981–990.

- For **PCS dataset**, the citation is:
  > R. Lakshmanamoorthy. *People clothing segmentation dataset*. Available at: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rajkumarl/people-clothing-segmentation, 2021.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its corresponding citation.
