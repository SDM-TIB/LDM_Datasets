To extract datasets from the research paper titled "FGPrompt: Fine-grained Goal Prompting for Image-goal Navigation" by Xinyu Sun et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method on **three benchmark datasets**: Gibson, MP3D, and HM3D. This is a strong indication that these datasets are crucial for the research.

Next, I will look for specific details about these datasets in the **experiments section**. In section 4, the authors mention that they train their agent on the **Gibson dataset** and validate it on Gibson, MP3D, and HM3D. They provide additional context about the training and evaluation settings, which helps confirm the datasets' relevance.

In the **dataset details subsection**, the authors specify that the Gibson dataset consists of 72 scenes, with a total of 648,000 episodes. They also mention that the MP3D and HM3D datasets are used for cross-domain evaluation, which further emphasizes their importance in the study.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

1. **Gibson Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Andrew A. Chang, et al. *Matterport3D: Learning from RGB-D Data in Indoor Environments*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1709.06158, 2017.

2. **Matterport3D (MP3D) Dataset**: The citation is:
   > A. Chang, et al. *Matterport3D: Learning from RGB-D Data in Indoor Environments*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1709.06158, 2017.

3. **HM3D Dataset**: The citation is:
   > S. K. Ramakrishnan, et al. *Habitat-Matterport 3D Dataset (HM3D): 1000 Large-Scale 3D Environments for Embodied AI*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2109.08238, 2021.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
