To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning to Steer Markovian Agents under Model Uncertainty" by Jiawei Huang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and previous work, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 6 in this case) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for empirical validation. I will look for any specific names of datasets, descriptions of their contents, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

In this paper, the authors mention using a **Grid World Stag Hunt Game** and a **Matching Pennies** game as experimental environments. However, they do not refer to external datasets but rather describe the environments they created for their experiments. Therefore, I will note these as the experimental setups rather than traditional datasets.

I will also check the **references section** to see if there are any citations related to datasets or prior works that might have used datasets relevant to their experiments. This could provide additional context or sources for datasets that are indirectly referenced.

Since the paper does not provide traditional datasets but rather describes experimental setups, I will summarize the relevant information as follows:

1. **Grid World Stag Hunt Game**: This is a simulated environment created by the authors for their experiments. It involves agents navigating a grid to achieve specific goals (e.g., reaching a 'stag' or 'hare').

2. **Matching Pennies Game**: Another experimental setup used in the paper, which is a classic two-player zero-sum game.

For the citations, since there are no traditional datasets referenced, I will not provide citations for datasets but will instead note the experimental environments as part of the methodology.

Now, I will compile the findings into a structured format for clarity, ensuring that I document the experimental setups and any relevant citations from the references section that may pertain to the methodologies used in the paper.
