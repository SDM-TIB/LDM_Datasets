To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Long Time No See! Open-Domain Conversation with Long-Term Persona Memory" by Xinchao Xu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned. The abstract introduces a new dialogue dataset called **DuLeMon**, which is a key focus of the paper. This indicates that I should look for more details about this dataset in the subsequent sections.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section closely. Here, the authors mention that DuLeMon is designed to address the limitations of existing persona dialogue datasets. They also reference other datasets like **PersonaChat**, **MSC**, and others, which may be relevant for citation purposes.

In the **data collection section**, the authors provide detailed information about how the DuLeMon dataset was constructed. They describe its features, such as the inclusion of both user and chatbot personas, and the process of dialogue collection. This section is crucial as it confirms the existence and significance of the DuLeMon dataset.

I will also check the **related work section** to find references to other datasets that have been previously established in the field. The authors mention several datasets, including:

1. **PersonaChat**: This dataset is referenced multiple times, indicating its importance in the context of persona-based dialogue systems.
2. **MSC (Multi-Session Chat)**: Another dataset mentioned as a multi-session extension of PersonaChat.

After identifying these datasets, I will look at the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This is essential for providing proper attribution.

The citations I will extract are as follows:

- For **DuLeMon**, since it is a new dataset introduced by the authors, I will cite it as:
  > Xinchao Xu, Zhibin Gou, Wenquan Wu, Zheng-Yu Niu, Hua Wu, Haifeng Wang, and Shihang Wang. *Long Time No See! Open-Domain Conversation with Long-Term Persona Memory*. In Proceedings of the ACL 2022, pages XX-XX, 2022. [Link to dataset if available]

- For **PersonaChat**, the citation is:
  > Saizheng Zhang, Emily Dinan, Jack Urbanek, Arthur Szlam, Douwe Kiela, and Jason Weston. *Personalizing dialogue agents: I have a dog, do you have pets too?* In Proceedings of the 56th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, ACL 2018, pages 2204â€“2213, 2018.

- For **MSC**, the citation is:
  > Jing Xu, Arthur Szlam, and Jason Weston. *Beyond goldfish memory: Long-term open-domain conversation*. In Proceedings of the 2021 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, EMNLP 2021, pages XX-XX, 2021.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This structured approach will help me accurately extract and document the datasets from the paper.
