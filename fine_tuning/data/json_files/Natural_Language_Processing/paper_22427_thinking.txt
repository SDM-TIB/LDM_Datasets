To extract datasets from the research paper titled "From Algorithm to Hardware: A Survey on Efficient and Safe Deployment of Deep Neural Networks" by Xue Geng et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections that discuss experiments or evaluations** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a general overview of the paper's focus but may not specify datasets. Therefore, I will pay close attention to the **introduction** and **subsequent sections** where datasets are likely to be discussed.

Next, I will look for specific sections that typically contain dataset information, such as **"Datasets," "Experiments," or "Methodology."** In this paper, I will particularly focus on sections that detail the methodologies used for model evaluation, as they often mention the datasets utilized.

As I read through the relevant sections, I will take note of any datasets explicitly named, along with their descriptions, sizes, and any relevant characteristics. If the authors refer to datasets by their common names, I will ensure to capture those accurately.

Once I have identified the datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. This is crucial for providing proper attribution and context for each dataset. I will look for the original papers or sources where these datasets were introduced or described.

For example, if the authors mention the **ImageNet dataset**, I will find its citation, which typically includes the authors, title, conference or journal name, and year of publication. 

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes:
1. The name of the dataset.
2. A brief description of the dataset.
3. The full citation for the dataset.

Finally, I will organize this information in a clear and structured manner, ready for further processing or review. This systematic approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant datasets and their citations from the paper.
