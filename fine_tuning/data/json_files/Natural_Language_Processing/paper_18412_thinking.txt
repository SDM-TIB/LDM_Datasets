To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Seller-Side Experiments under Interference Induced by Feedback Loops in Two-Sided Platforms" by Zhihua Zhu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets or experiments**. In this paper, the authors discuss various methodologies and may reference datasets used for empirical evaluations. I will pay close attention to any specific names or descriptions of datasets that are utilized in their experiments.

As I read through the paper, I will take note of any datasets mentioned, including their names, descriptions, and any relevant details such as the number of samples, types of data collected, and the context in which they were used. If the authors refer to datasets from other studies, I will ensure to capture those references as well.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets themselves.

For example, if the authors mention using a dataset from a previous study, I will look for that study in the references and extract the complete citation. If the dataset is original to this research, I will summarize its details based on the information provided in the paper.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that all relevant datasets are accurately documented and attributed.

By following these steps, I will be able to extract and present the datasets from the paper in a clear and organized manner, ensuring that the full citations are included for each dataset referenced.
