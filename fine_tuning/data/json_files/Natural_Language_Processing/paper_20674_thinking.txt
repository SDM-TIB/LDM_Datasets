To extract datasets from the research paper titled "PE: A Poincare Explanation Method for Fast Text Hierarchy Generation" by Qian Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract does not explicitly mention any datasets, but the introduction discusses the need for interpretability in NLP models, which may lead to the use of specific datasets later in the paper.

Next, I will look at **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, I find a table (Table 2) that lists three datasets used for evaluation:

1. **Rotten Tomatoes**: This dataset is used for sentiment analysis and contains 10,000 training samples, 2,000 validation samples, and 2,000 test samples. The average text length is 64 characters, and it has 2 classes (positive and negative).

2. **TREC**: This dataset is used for question classification and consists of 10,000 training samples, 2,000 validation samples, and 1,000 test samples. The average text length is 64 characters, and it has 6 classes.

3. **Yelp**: This dataset is used for sentiment analysis and contains 5,000 training samples, 452 validation samples, and 500 test samples. The average text length is 256 characters, and it has 2 classes.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **Rotten Tomatoes**:
  > Pang, B., & Lee, L. (2005). Seeing stars: Exploiting class relationships for sentiment categorization with respect to rating scales. In Proceedings of the 43rd Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACLâ€™05).

- For **TREC**:

- For **Yelp**:

Now that I have gathered the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
