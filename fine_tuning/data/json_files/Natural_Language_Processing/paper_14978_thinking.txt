To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for Neural Information Retrieval" by Carlos Dominguez et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the use of the **BEIR benchmark**, which indicates that there are datasets involved. I will note this down as a potential dataset to explore further.

Next, I will look into **section 4.2 (BEIR Benchmark)**, where the authors describe the BEIR benchmark in detail. They mention that it comprises **18 retrieval datasets** for evaluation, which is crucial information. I will list these datasets and check if they are explicitly named in this section.

I will also examine the **experiments section** to see if the authors refer to specific datasets used in their experiments. They mention using **MS-MARCO** for training their base IR system, which is another dataset I need to document.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is essential for proper attribution and to provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.

The datasets I will extract include:

1. **BEIR Benchmark**: This is a collection of 18 datasets for information retrieval tasks. The citation for the BEIR benchmark is:
   > Nandan Thakur, Nils Reimers, Andreas Rücklé, Abhishek Srivastava, and Iryna Gurevych. *BEIR: A heterogeneous benchmark for zero-shot evaluation of information retrieval models*. In Thirty-fifth Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems Datasets and Benchmarks Track (Round 2), 2021.

2. **MS-MARCO**: This dataset is used for training the supervised system. The citation for MS-MARCO is:
   > Tri Nguyen, Mir Rosenberg, Xia Song, Jianfeng Gao, Saurabh Tiwary, Rangan Majumder, and Li Deng. *MS MARCO: A human generated machine reading comprehension dataset*. CoRR, abs/1611.09268, 2016.

Next, I will ensure that I have captured any additional datasets mentioned in the paper, especially in the context of the experiments or methodology sections. If the authors refer to specific datasets within the BEIR benchmark, I will need to extract those names and their corresponding citations as well.

Finally, I will compile all the identified datasets along with their citations into a structured format for easy reference and further processing. This will ensure that I have a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
