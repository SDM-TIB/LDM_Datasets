To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Sensitivity of BLANC to human-scored qualities of text summaries" by Oleg Vasilyev et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study but does not specify any datasets. Therefore, I will move on to the introduction.

In the **introduction**, the authors reference human evaluations and mention the use of a python package called "blanc," but they do not mention specific datasets yet. I will continue to the methodology section.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology and experiments sections**. Here, the authors describe their human evaluation process, which involved scoring summaries generated from a dataset of 300 summary-text pairs. They mention that these pairs were created from 100 randomly sampled news articles, but they do not provide a specific name for this dataset.

In the **factual errors section**, the authors mention using synthetic data from the CNN/Daily Mail dataset for their experiments. This is a significant dataset that I need to document.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. For the **CNN/Daily Mail dataset**, the citation is:
   > Karl Moritz Hermann, Tomáš Kočiský, Edward Grefenstette, Lasse Espeholt, Will Kay, Mustafa Suleyman, and Phil Blunsom. *Teaching machines to read and comprehend*. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 28, pages 1693–1701, 2015.

Since the authors did not provide a specific citation for the dataset of 300 summary-text pairs, I will note that it is based on 100 randomly sampled news articles but will not include it as a formal dataset entry due to the lack of a specific name or citation.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for clarity and future reference.
