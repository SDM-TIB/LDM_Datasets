To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Automatic Standardization of Arabic Dialects for Machine Translation" by Abidrabbo Alnassan, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to gather initial insights about any datasets referenced. The abstract mentions an "annotated multimedia corpus" based on the television series **Marāyā 2013**, which suggests that this corpus is a key dataset for the research.

Next, I will focus on the **section titled "Marāyā 2013"** where the author provides a detailed description of this dataset. The paper states that **Marāyā 2013** is a Syrian television series that includes thirty episodes, with the primary language being the Syrian dialect of Damascus. This section provides essential details about the dataset, including its content and structure.

In addition, I will look for any other datasets mentioned in the **previous work** or **ADs-MSA parallel corpora creation** sections. The paper discusses the use of the **Arabic Online Commentary (AOC) dataset**, which was created by crawling Arabic newspapers and annotating sentences for dialect identification. This dataset is also relevant to the research.

Now, I will compile the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper:

1. **Marāyā 2013**:
   - Citation: Alnassan, A. (2016a). *Les compétences lexicales en arabe langue étrangère/seconde : analyse d'un corpus télévisuel syrien*. Thèse de doctorat en sciences du langage préparée à l’Université Lumière Lyon 2 et soutenue publiquement le 02 juillet 2016.

2. **Arabic Online Commentary (AOC) dataset**:
   - Citation: Zaidan, O. F., & Callison-Burch, C. (2011). *Crowdsourcing translation: Professional quality from non-professionals*. In Proceedings of the 49th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies (pp. 1220–1229). Portland, Oregon.

After gathering this information, I will ensure that I accurately document each dataset's details, including their purpose and the context in which they were used in the research. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the study.
