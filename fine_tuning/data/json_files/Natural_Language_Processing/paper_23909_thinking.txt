To extract datasets from the research paper titled "AlignMMBench: Evaluating Chinese Multimodal Alignment in Large Vision-Language Models" by Yuhang Wu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that AlignMMBench includes "1,054 images and 4,978 question-answer pairs," which indicates that a dataset is indeed present.

Next, I will examine **section 3 (AlignMMBench)**, which provides a detailed description of the dataset composition. Here, the authors explicitly mention that AlignMMBench consists of "1,056 images and 4,978 associated test cases," categorized into three primary categories and thirteen distinct tasks. This section is crucial as it outlines the dataset's structure and purpose.

In **section 3.1 (Dataset composition)**, the authors describe the dataset's tasks, including:
- **Description**: Evaluating the modelâ€™s ability to provide general descriptions of images.
- **Recognition**: Recognizing objects in images.
- **Counting**: Providing the exact number of specific objects in images.
- **OCR**: Recognizing and understanding Chinese characters within images.
- **Meme**: Understanding memes and their meanings.
- **Knowledge**: Testing world knowledge based on images.
- **Reasoning and Analysis**: Evaluating logical reasoning and problem-solving abilities.
- **Dialogue Context**: Assessing coherence and incoherence in dialogue scenarios.

The dataset is specifically designed for evaluating the alignment capabilities of Chinese Vision-Language Models (VLMs), which is a significant contribution to the field.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. Since AlignMMBench is a new benchmark introduced in this paper, it does not have a separate citation but is referenced as part of the paper itself. Therefore, I will cite the paper as the source of the dataset.

The full citation for the dataset is:
> Yuhang Wu, Wenmeng Yu, Yean Cheng, Yan Wang, Xiaohan Zhang, Jiazheng Xu, Ming Ding, Yuxiao Dong. *AlignMMBench: Evaluating Chinese Multimodal Alignment in Large Vision-Language Models*. Preprint. Under review.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the citation for the dataset as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the dataset extracted from the paper.
