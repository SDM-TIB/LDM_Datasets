To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Diffusion Attack: Leveraging Stable Diffusion for Naturalistic Image Attacking" by Qianyu Guo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of a pre-trained Deep Stable Diffusion model for generating adversarial images, which suggests that there may be datasets involved in training or evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to see if the authors mention any specific datasets used for their experiments. The introduction emphasizes the use of neural style transfer and adversarial attacks but does not explicitly name any datasets.

Moving on to **section 3 (Experiment and Preliminary Results)**, I will look for any references to datasets used for training or evaluation. The authors mention using images from **ImageNet** and "widely collected data from the Internet" for their style transfer training. This indicates that ImageNet is a key dataset used in their experiments.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the ImageNet dataset. The standard citation for ImageNet is:

- For **ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Olga Russakovsky, Jia Deng, Hao Sheng, et al. *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 115(3):211-252, 2015.

Since the paper does not provide a specific dataset name for the "widely collected data from the Internet," I will note that this is a general reference and does not have a formal citation.

Now, I will compile the dataset information I have gathered:

1. **ImageNet**: A large-scale dataset used for training and evaluating image classification models, which includes millions of labeled images across thousands of categories.

After this, I will prepare the dataset entries in the required format, ensuring that the full citation for ImageNet is included.

In summary, I have identified **ImageNet** as the primary dataset used in the experiments, and I will ensure to include its full citation in the final output.
