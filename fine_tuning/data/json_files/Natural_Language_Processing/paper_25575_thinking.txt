To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Do Generative AI Models Output Harm while Representing Non-Western Cultures: Evidence from A Community-Centered Approach" by Sourojit Ghosh et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and findings sections** to look for any references to datasets. The abstract mentions a community-centered approach and focus groups, which suggests that qualitative data may have been collected, but I need to confirm if any specific datasets are referenced.

Next, I will examine the **methods section**, particularly the part where the authors describe their focus group recruitment and the prompts used for generating outputs from the text-to-image model. This section may provide insights into the data collection process and whether any datasets were created or utilized during the study.

In the **findings section**, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or data sources that were analyzed or referenced. The authors discuss various themes and harms identified through participant responses, but I need to determine if they refer to any specific datasets that were used for analysis or comparison.

After identifying any datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for these datasets. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for the datasets used in the research.

If the paper does not explicitly mention datasets, I will note that the study primarily relies on qualitative data from focus groups rather than traditional datasets. However, if any datasets are identified, I will ensure to document them with their full citations.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and attributed to its source, ready for further processing or review.
