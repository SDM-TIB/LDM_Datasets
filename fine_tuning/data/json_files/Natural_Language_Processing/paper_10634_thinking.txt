To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Successor-Predecessor Intrinsic Exploration" by Changmin Yu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, and the introduction often discusses the context and relevance of the datasets used.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. This is typically where authors describe the datasets they used for their experiments, including details such as the number of samples, types of data, and any specific characteristics that are relevant to the study.

In this paper, I will pay special attention to any references to specific environments or tasks that may imply the use of datasets, such as "Atari games" or "grid worlds." If the authors mention using standard benchmarks or datasets, I will note these down.

Once I identify the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

For example, if the authors mention using the **Atari Learning Environment**, I would look for the citation that describes this environment in detail. Similarly, if they reference specific datasets for reinforcement learning tasks, I will ensure to find and document those citations.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each entry is clear and informative.

Finally, I will format the extracted information according to the required structure, making sure that all datasets are accurately represented and properly cited for future reference.
