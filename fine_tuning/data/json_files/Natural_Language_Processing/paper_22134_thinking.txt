To extract datasets from the research paper titled "KVP10k: A Comprehensive Dataset for Key-Value Pair Extraction in Business Documents" by Oshri Naparstek et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract introduces **KVP10k**, which is described as a new dataset specifically designed for key-value pair extraction, containing 10,707 richly annotated images. This indicates that KVP10k is a primary dataset of interest.

Next, I will examine the **related work** section to see if any other datasets are referenced. The authors mention several existing datasets relevant to key-value pair extraction, including **FUNSD**, **XFUND**, and **SIBR**. I will note these datasets as they may be relevant for context or comparison.

In the **data acquisition** section, the authors describe how they collected data for KVP10k, but they do not introduce any new datasets here. Instead, they focus on the methodology for gathering data from various sources, which reinforces the significance of KVP10k.

Moving to the **dataset characteristics** and **benchmark** sections, I will look for any additional datasets mentioned. The authors provide statistics and comparisons with existing datasets, but the focus remains on KVP10k. They also reference **CORD**, **SROIE**, **Kleister-NDA**, and others as part of the discussion on limitations of existing datasets.

Now, I will compile the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper:

1. **KVP10k**:

Now that I have identified and cited the datasets, I will ensure that I present this information clearly and accurately for any further processing or review.
