To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Internet of Federated Digital Twins (IoFDT): Connecting Twins Beyond Borders for Society 5.0" by Tao Yu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections that discuss experiments or applications** to find any references to datasets. The abstract provides a high-level overview, but I will focus on sections that are likely to contain specific dataset information.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets or experimental platforms**. In this paper, the authors discuss the implementation of a unified IoFDT platform and mention practical applications, which may include datasets used for testing or validation.

In the **experimental section**, I will pay close attention to any mention of data sources or datasets utilized in their proof-of-concept (PoC) implementations. The authors may describe specific datasets used for smart mobility applications or other areas relevant to their research.

After identifying any datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. This is crucial as I need to provide complete and accurate citations for each dataset mentioned. If the datasets are derived from existing works, I will ensure to cite the original sources.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset related to smart mobility, I will look for the original publication that introduced or described that dataset. I will extract the necessary citation details, including authors, title, publication venue, and year.

Once I have gathered all the relevant information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets referenced in the paper.

Finally, I will organize the dataset information clearly and concisely, ready for any further processing or review.
