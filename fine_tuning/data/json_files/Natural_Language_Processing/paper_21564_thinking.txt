To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Negation Triplet Extraction with Syntactic Dependency and Semantic Consistency" by Yuchen Shi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors constructed a high-quality Chinese dataset called **NegComment** based on user reviews from Meituan, which is a significant finding.

Next, I will look for more details about the **NegComment dataset** in the **methodology section**. Here, the authors describe how they collected the dataset from user reviews across various domains, including hotel, tourism, and restaurant reviews. They mention that the dataset consists of 7,049 validated sentences, which is crucial information for understanding the dataset's scope.

In the **experiments section**, the authors discuss how they used the NegComment dataset to evaluate their proposed model, SSENE. This reinforces the importance of this dataset in their research.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the NegComment dataset. However, since this dataset is newly constructed by the authors, it may not have a separate citation in the references. Instead, I will note that the dataset is described in detail within the paper itself.

The citation for the paper is:
> Yuchen Shi, Deqing Yang, Jingping Liu, Yanghua Xiao, Zongyu Wang, Huimin Xu. *Negation Triplet Extraction with Syntactic Dependency and Semantic Consistency*. In Proceedings of the [Conference Name], [Year].

Since the NegComment dataset is a product of this research, I will include the citation of the paper as the reference for the dataset.

Finally, I will compile the information about the NegComment dataset, including its description and citation, into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the dataset's details and its source.
