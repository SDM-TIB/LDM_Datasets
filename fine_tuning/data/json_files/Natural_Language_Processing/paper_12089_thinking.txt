To extract datasets from the research paper titled "OntoChatGPT Information System: Ontology-Driven Structured Prompts for ChatGPT Meta-Learning" by Oleksandr Palagin et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or data sources.

Next, I will check the **methodology section** for any detailed descriptions of datasets used in the experiments or analyses. This section often contains information about the data collection process, types of data, and any specific datasets that were utilized.

In the **results section**, I will look for any references to datasets that were analyzed or compared. This may include performance metrics or evaluations based on specific datasets.

After identifying potential datasets, I will consult the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like "WebProtégé," I would look for its citation in the references. The citation might look something like this:
> Biomedical Informatics Research Group, “WebProtégé,” [Online]. Available at: https://webprotege.stanford.edu/

Similarly, if "Apache Jena Fuseki" is mentioned, I would find its citation:
> The Apache Software Foundation, “Apache Jena,” [Online]. Available at: https://jena.apache.org/index.html.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation.

Finally, I will organize this information in a clear format for easy reference, ensuring that all datasets are accurately represented and properly cited.
