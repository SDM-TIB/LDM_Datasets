To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Open Gaze: Open Source eye tracker for smartphone devices using Deep Learning" by Jyothi Swaroop Reddy Bommareddy and Sushmanth Reddy Mereddy, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and dataset sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the use of the **MIT GazeCapture dataset**, which is a strong indication that this dataset is crucial for the research.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the need for eye tracking research on smartphones and reference the **MIT GazeCapture dataset** as a significant resource for their study. This reinforces the importance of this dataset in their work.

Next, I will focus on the **dataset section** (section 2) where the authors provide a detailed description of the **MIT GazeCapture dataset**. They explain that it was originally released in 2016 and contains a wealth of eye movement data collected from diverse participants using smartphones. The dataset includes JSON files with bounding box coordinates for eyes and faces, along with other relevant statistics.

The authors also mention that the dataset is accessible through registration on its dedicated website, which is important for anyone looking to use the dataset.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the MIT GazeCapture dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:

> Krafka K, Khosla A, Kellnhofer P, Kannan H, Bhandarkar S, Matusik W, Torralba A (2016) Eye tracking for everyone. IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition (CVPR).

This citation is essential for proper attribution and for others to locate the dataset.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This will ensure that the dataset is accurately represented and can be easily referenced in future work.
