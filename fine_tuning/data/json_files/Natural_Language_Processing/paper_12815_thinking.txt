To extract datasets from the research paper titled "AI Chatbots as Multi-Role Pedagogical Agents: Transforming Engagement in CS Education" by Cassie Chen Cao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The introduction discusses the use of AI-powered chatbots in education, but I need to look for specific datasets that may have been used in the research.

Next, I will focus on the **Research Methods section**. Here, the authors describe their experimental design and participant allocation. They mention collecting data on student inquiries and interactions, but I need to determine if they reference any specific datasets used for analysis or evaluation.

In the **Preliminary Results section**, the authors mention generating a dataset that combines students' questions at different cognitive levels and the corresponding chatbot responses. This indicates that they created a dataset for their study, but I need to clarify if they reference any existing datasets or provide details about this generated dataset.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find any citations related to datasets. The references may include foundational datasets or studies that informed their research. However, it appears that the paper primarily discusses the development of a new dataset rather than relying on established datasets.

Since the authors do not provide a full citation for the generated dataset, I will note that it is a unique dataset created for this study and does not have an external citation. I will summarize the dataset as follows:

1. **Cognitive Level Dataset**: A dataset generated from students' questions categorized by cognitive levels, along with the chatbot's responses. This dataset is used to evaluate the performance of the chatbots in terms of accuracy, engagement, and empathy.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I clearly indicate the nature of the dataset and its relevance to the study. Since there are no external datasets cited in the paper, I will focus on the unique dataset created for the research.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entry for review or further processing.
