To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Vulnerability of Attribution Methods Using Pre-Softmax Scores" by Miguel Lerma and Mirtha Lucas, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections that discuss experiments or methodologies** to identify any datasets that are explicitly referenced. The abstract does not mention any datasets, so I will proceed to the introduction.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the black box nature of AI models and the need for explanation methods, but they do not mention specific datasets. I will continue to the **previous work section** to see if any datasets are referenced in the context of prior research.

Next, I will examine **section 3**, which discusses vulnerabilities in attribution methods. While this section focuses on theoretical aspects and does not mention datasets, I will check the **discussion and conclusion sections** for any references to datasets used in their experiments or analyses.

After reviewing the entire paper, I notice that the authors do not explicitly mention any datasets used for their experiments or analyses. Instead, they focus on theoretical vulnerabilities and do not provide empirical results based on specific datasets.

Since no datasets are identified in the paper, I will not be able to provide any dataset entries or citations. However, I will ensure to document this finding clearly, noting that the paper primarily discusses theoretical vulnerabilities without empirical validation on specific datasets.

In conclusion, I will summarize my findings, emphasizing the lack of dataset references in the paper, and prepare to communicate this clearly in the final output.
