To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Strategies for Successful Crowd Navigation" by Rajshree Daulatabad and Serena Nath, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and method sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of a neural network for crowd navigation, which suggests that data collection is involved, but I need to find specific datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **method section**, particularly the **data collection** subsection. Here, the authors describe their data collection process, which involved recording approximately 4 hours of video over 7 days. They mention that the data was collected in various scenarios, including before, during, and after classes, and during lunch. However, they do not specify a formal dataset name at this point.

I will also check the **data normalization** and **neural network training** sections to see if any specific datasets are referenced. The authors mention using a 64x64 occupancy map as input for their neural network, which indicates that they have structured their data in a specific format, but again, no formal dataset name is provided.

To ensure I have captured all relevant datasets, I will review the **references section** to see if any external datasets are cited. The references include various studies related to crowd navigation and human behavior, but they do not explicitly mention a dataset that the authors used.

After thoroughly reviewing the paper, it appears that the authors primarily used their own collected data rather than referencing established datasets. Therefore, I will document the dataset as follows:

1. **Robot-Human Interaction Dataset**: This dataset consists of video recordings of a robot navigating through a university hallway while interacting with pedestrians. The data includes various scenarios and is structured as a 64x64 occupancy map with robot orientation and action details.

Since this dataset is original and created by the authors, I will provide a citation for the paper itself as the source of the dataset:

- Daulatabad, R., & Nath, S. (Year). Learning Strategies for Successful Crowd Navigation. *Proceedings of the [Conference/Journal Name]*. [DOI or URL if available].

Now, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
