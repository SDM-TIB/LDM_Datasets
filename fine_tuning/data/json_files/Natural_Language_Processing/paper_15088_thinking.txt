To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Empirical Review of Youth-Employment Policies in Nigeria" by Oluwasola E. Omoju et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the relevant datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to gather initial insights about the datasets. The abstract mentions the use of **primary data collected through focus-group discussions and key-informant interviews**, indicating that these are primary datasets relevant to the study.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section** where the authors describe their data collection methods in detail. They mention using **desk review, focus-group discussions, and key-informant interviews** to gather both primary and secondary data. I will note the specifics of these datasets, including the number of participants in focus-group discussions (206 participants, with 44% being women) and the number of key-informant interviews conducted (80 interviews).

I will also look for any **quantitative data** presented in the results section, particularly any statistics or figures that summarize findings related to youth employment programs. For instance, the paper discusses various youth-employment programs (YEP) and their impacts, which may include numerical data on beneficiaries, funding amounts, and program outcomes.

As I identify each dataset, I will ensure to capture the **full citation** for each dataset mentioned in the references section. This includes looking for studies or reports that provide empirical data on youth employment in Nigeria, such as:

1. **National Youth Survey 2020**: This dataset is referenced in the methodology and results sections, providing demographic and employment statistics for Nigerian youth.
   - Citation: Federal Ministry of Youth and Sports Development and National Bureau of Statistics (2020). *National Youth Survey 2020*. Available at: https://nigerianstat.gov.ng/download/1241079

2. **Budget Office Reports**: These reports provide data on budget allocations for youth programs, which are mentioned throughout the paper.
   - Citation: Budget Office of the Federation (2023a). *2023 Appropriation Act by Sector: Federal Ministry of Youth and Sports Development*. Available at: https://www.budgetoffice.gov.ng/index.php/2023-appropriation-act-by-sector/federal-ministry-of-youth-sports-development-2/viewdocument/913

3. **World Bank Indicators**: The paper references various statistics from the World Bank regarding youth unemployment and education.
   - Citation: World Bank (n.d.). *Data: Share of Youth Not in Education, Employment or Training, total (% of Youth Population) â€“ Nigeria*. Available at: https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SL.UEM.NEET.ZS?locations=NG

After gathering all relevant datasets and their citations, I will compile them into a structured format for easy reference and further analysis. This will ensure that I have accurately documented the datasets used in the research and their sources, which is crucial for transparency and reproducibility in research.
