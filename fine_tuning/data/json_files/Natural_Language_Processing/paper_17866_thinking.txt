To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CodePrompt: Improving Source Code-Related Classification with Knowledge Features through Prompt Learning" by Yong Ma et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Tasks and Datasets)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. This section is likely to contain detailed information about each dataset, including its purpose and characteristics.

In **subsection 4.1.1 (Code Language Classification)**, the authors mention using the **SC++ dataset**, which collects programming languages from the Stack Overflow community. I will note the details provided about this dataset.

In **subsection 4.1.2 (Code Smell Classification)**, the authors refer to a corpus built by Fakhoury et al., which consists of 4205 lines of source code from 13 Java open-source systems. I will extract this information as well.

In **subsection 4.1.3 (Code Comment Classification)**, the authors mention using a corpus shared by Pascarella and Bacchelli, which contains over 11,000 code reviews from six Java open-source projects. This will be another dataset entry.

In **subsection 4.1.4 (Technical Debt Classification)**, the authors discuss a dataset presented by Maldonado et al., consisting of approximately 10,000 code comments from 10 open-source projects. I will include this dataset in my extraction.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the sources for further exploration.

The full citations I will extract are:

1. For the **SC++ dataset**:
   > Alrashedy K, Dharmaretnam D, German DM, Srinivasan V, Aaron Gulliver T. *SCC++: Predicting the programming language of questions and snippets of Stack Overflow*. Journal of Systems and Software, 162(C), 2020.

2. For the **Code Smell Classification dataset**:
   > Fakhoury S, Arnaoudova V, Noiseux C, Khomh F, Antoniol G. *Keep it simple: Is deep learning good for linguistic smell detection?* In: 2018 IEEE 25th International Conference on Software Analysis, Evolution and Reengineering (SANER), pp 602–611, 2018.

3. For the **Code Comment Classification dataset**:
   > Pascarella L, Bacchelli A. *Classifying code comments in Java open-source software systems*. In: Proceedings of the 14th International Conference on Mining Software Repositories, IEEE Press, Buenos Aires, Argentina, pp 227–237, 2017.

4. For the **Technical Debt Classification dataset**:
   > Maldonado EdS, Shihab E, Tsantalis N. *Using Natural Language Processing to Automatically Detect Self-Admitted Technical Debt*. IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, 43(11):1044–1062, 2017.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries along with their full citations into a structured format for further processing or review.
