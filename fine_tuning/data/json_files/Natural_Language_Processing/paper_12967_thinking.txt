To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Unified Masked Autoencoder with Patchified Skeletons for Motion Synthesis" by Esteve Valls Mascaró et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the model is evaluated on the **Human3.6M dataset** and the **LaFAN1 dataset**, which suggests that these are the primary datasets used in the research.

Next, I will look for specific details about these datasets in the **experimental results section**. Here, the authors explicitly mention the **Human3.6M dataset**, describing it as containing 3.6 million 3D poses of humans performing 15 daily activities. They also mention that they report Mean Per Joint Position Error (MPJPE) for their evaluations.

For the **LaFAN1 dataset**, the authors state that it contains 496,672 motions sampled at 30Hz, captured in a MOCAP studio, and they report various metrics for evaluating motion inbetweening.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. **Human3.6M dataset**:
   > Ionescu, C., Papava, D., Olaru, V., & Sminchisescu, C. (2014). Human3.6M: Large Scale Datasets and Predictive Methods for 3D Human Sensing in Natural Environments. *Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence (TPAMI)*, 36(7), 1325–1339.

2. **LaFAN1 dataset**:
   > Harvey, F. G., Yurick, M., Nowrouzezahrai, D., & Pal, C. J. (2020). Robust motion in-betweening. *ACM Transactions on Graphics (TOG)*, 39(4), 60–1.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

- **Human3.6M dataset**: A large-scale dataset containing 3.6 million 3D poses of humans performing 15 daily activities, used for motion forecasting.
- **LaFAN1 dataset**: A dataset containing 496,672 motions sampled at 30Hz, used for evaluating motion inbetweening.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations, ensuring that all information is accurately represented for future reference or processing.
