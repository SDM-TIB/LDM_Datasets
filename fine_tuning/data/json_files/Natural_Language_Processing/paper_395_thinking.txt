To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Misspelling Oblivious Word Embeddings" by Bora Edizel et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors trained their embeddings on a new dataset they are releasing publicly, which suggests that there is a specific dataset to look for.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for any additional context or details about the datasets. The introduction mentions that the authors propose a dataset of misspellings to train their model, which reinforces the idea that there is a specific dataset being discussed.

I will then focus on **section 4 (Data)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used in their experiments. This section is likely to contain the most relevant information about the datasets. 

In **section 4.1**, the authors describe the English text corpus used for training the FastText model, which is an English Wikipedia dump. They mention that the processed training corpus consists of over 4 billion words, and they provide a link to the source of the dataset.

In **section 4.2**, the authors explain how they generated the misspellings dataset, which consists of pairs of misspelled words and their correct variants. They describe the automated process used to create this dataset, including the size of the dataset, which contains over 20 million pairs of misspellings.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The citations will be crucial for proper documentation.

1. For the **English Wikipedia dump**, while the paper does not provide a specific citation, I can reference it as follows:
   > Wikimedia Foundation. *Wikipedia: The Free Encyclopedia*. Available at: https://www.wikipedia.org/

2. For the **misspellings dataset**, the authors provide a link to the dataset:
   > Edizel, B., Piktus, A., Bojanowski, P., Ferreira, R., Grave, E., & Silvestri, F. (2023). *Misspelling Oblivious Word Embeddings Dataset*. Available at: https://bitbucket.org/bedizel/moe

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations. This will ensure that the datasets are properly documented and can be referenced in future work.
