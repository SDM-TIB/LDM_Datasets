To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Optimal Transport on the Lie Group of Roto-translations" by Daan Bon et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions, and it may mention specific datasets used for experiments or evaluations.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors often discuss the context of their work and may reference datasets that are foundational to their research. I will look for phrases like "we evaluated our method on" or "we used the following datasets."

Then, I will examine the **experiments section** in detail. This section typically contains the most explicit references to datasets, including descriptions of their characteristics, sizes, and how they were utilized in the experiments. I will take note of any datasets mentioned here, including any specific metrics or results associated with them.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets themselves.

In this paper, I expect to find datasets related to image processing or optimal transport, as indicated by the focus on applications in these areas. I will look for datasets that are commonly used in the field, such as benchmark datasets for image analysis or specific datasets mentioned in the context of the experiments.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation as found in the references section.

Finally, I will format the extracted information clearly and concisely, ready for further processing or review.
