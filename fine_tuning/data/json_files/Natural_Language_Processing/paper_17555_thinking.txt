To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The Tyranny of Possibilities in the Design of Task-Oriented LLM Systems: A Scoping Survey" by Dhruv Dhamani and Mary Lou Maher, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections that discuss experiments or methodologies** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a high-level overview, but I need to look for specific references to datasets in the body of the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **sections that discuss current research and design parameters**. These sections may contain references to datasets used in previous studies or examples that illustrate the concepts being discussed. I will pay particular attention to any citations or references that indicate the source of the datasets.

I will also check the **References section** at the end of the paper to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. This is crucial, as I need to ensure that I have the correct and complete citations for each dataset.

As I read through the paper, I will take notes on any datasets that are explicitly mentioned, including their names, descriptions, and the context in which they are used. If the paper discusses datasets without providing full citations, I will look up the original sources to ensure I can provide accurate references.

Once I have identified the datasets, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for each dataset as required. This will involve formatting the citations according to the style used in the paper, which typically follows academic conventions.

Finally, I will review my findings to ensure that I have accurately captured all relevant datasets and their citations, preparing them for any further processing or presentation as needed.
