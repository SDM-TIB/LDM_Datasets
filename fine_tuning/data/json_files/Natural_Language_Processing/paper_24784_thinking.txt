To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Improving Retrieval-augmented Text-to-SQL with AST-based Ranking and Schema Pruning" by Zhili Shen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to gather initial insights about the datasets used. The abstract mentions that the authors apply their approach to "monolingual and cross-lingual benchmarks for semantic parsing," which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets they experimented with. Here, they mention several SQL datasets, specifically:

1. **CSPIDER**: The authors note that CSPIDER is a translated version of SPIDER in Chinese, and they report experiments on it. They also mention that CSPIDER contains 8,659 examples of questions and SQL queries along with their relevant SQL schemata.

2. **SPIDER**: This dataset is highlighted as containing 8,659 examples of questions and SQL queries, similar to CSPIDER, but in English. The authors indicate that they focus on the development sets for their experiments.

3. **SPIDER-DK**: A variant of the SPIDER dataset, which is used to evaluate zero-shot domain generalization.

4. **SPIDER-REAL**: Another variant of the SPIDER dataset, also used for evaluation.

5. **SPIDER-SYN**: A further variant of the SPIDER dataset, used for testing.

In the **References section**, I will look for full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries with their full citations for further processing.
