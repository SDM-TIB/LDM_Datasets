To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An Empirical Study of Tokenization Strategies for Various Korean NLP Tasks" by Kyubyong Park et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors tested various tokenization strategies on several Korean NLP tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section 5) closely, as this is where datasets are typically detailed. In this section, the authors mention several datasets used for different tasks:

1. **AI Hub Korean-English Parallel Corpus**: This dataset is used for machine translation tasks. The authors describe it as containing 800K sentence pairs, which they split into training, development, and test sets.

2. **KorQuAD 1.0 Dataset**: This dataset is a Korean adaptation of the SQuAD 1.0 dataset, consisting of 10,645 passages and 66,181 questions. It is specifically used for machine reading comprehension tasks.

3. **KorNLI Dataset**: This dataset is sourced from three different NLI datasets and contains 950,354 sentence pairs, used for natural language inference tasks.

4. **KorSTS Dataset**: This dataset is a Korean semantic textual similarity dataset, translated from the STS-B dataset, comprising 8,628 sentence pairs.

5. **NSMC Dataset**: This is a movie review dataset scraped from Naver Movies™, consisting of 200K samples for sentiment analysis tasks.

6. **PAWS-X Dataset**: This dataset is used for paraphrase identification and includes 53,338 sentence pairs in Korean.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. Here are the citations I will extract:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
