To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Locating and Editing Factual Associations in Mamba" by Arnab Sen Sharma et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors used two datasets: **COUNTERFACT** and **RELATIONS**. This indicates that I should look for detailed descriptions of these datasets in the paper.

Next, I will navigate to the **appendix** section, specifically **Appendix A**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets. Here, I will find the following information:

1. **COUNTERFACT Dataset**: This dataset was developed by Meng et al. (2022a) for evaluating counterfactual edits in language models. It contains 21,919 requests formatted as {s, r, o, o∗, π∗}, where 's' is the subject, 'r' is the relation, 'o' is the correct answer, 'o∗' is the counterfactual edit request, and 'π∗' is a paraphrase of the prompt. The authors adapted this dataset from PARAREL and scraped data from Wikidata.

2. **RELATIONS Dataset**: Introduced by Hernandez et al. (2023), this dataset consists of 47 relations of four types: factual, linguistic, bias, and commonsense. The authors specifically utilized the 26 factual relations for their experiments, which include various associations between entities.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to retrieve the full citations for each dataset:

- For **COUNTERFACT**, the citation is:
  > Kevin Meng, David Bau, Alex Andonian, and Yonatan Belinkov. *Locating and editing factual associations in GPT*. Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 35:17359–17372, 2022a.

- For **RELATIONS**, the citation is:
  > Evan Hernandez, Arnab Sen Sharma, Tal Haklay, Kevin Meng, Martin Wattenberg, Jacob Andreas, Yonatan Belinkov, and David Bau. *Linearity of relation decoding in transformer language models*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2308.09124, 2023.

Now that I have gathered all necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or analysis.
