To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ID-XCB: Data-independent Debiasing for Fair and Accurate Transformer-based Cyberbullying Detection" by Peiling Yi and Arkaitz Zubiaga, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors explore their method on "two popular session-based cyberbullying datasets," which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Datasets and Lexicon)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used in their research. Here, they state that they utilize two existing session-based cyberbullying datasets from different social media platforms: **Instagram** and **Vine**. The authors provide a brief description of how these datasets were collected, emphasizing the presence of toxic words to maximize the chances of collecting positive samples.

To ensure I have the correct details, I will also check **Table 1**, which presents statistics for both datasets, including the number of sessions, comments, users, average session length, and unique swear words. This information is crucial for understanding the datasets' characteristics.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For the **Instagram dataset**, the citation is:
  > Homa Hosseinmardi, Sabrina Arredondo Mattson, Rahat Ibn Rafiq, Richard Han, Qin Lv, and Shivakant Mishra. *Analyzing labeled cyberbullying incidents on the instagram social network*. In International conference on social informatics, pages 49–66, Springer, 2015.

- For the **Vine dataset**, the citation is:
  > Rahat Ibn Rafiq, Homa Hosseinmardi, Richard Han, Qin Lv, Shivakant Mishra, and Sabrina Arredondo Mattson. *Careful what you share in six seconds: Detecting cyberbullying instances in vine*. In Proceedings of the 2015 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Advances in Social Networks Analysis and Mining, ASONAM 2015, Paris, France, August 25 - 28, 2015, pages 617–622. ACM.

With these citations in hand, I will compile the dataset information, ensuring that I include the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations as required. This structured approach will help me accurately extract and present the datasets used in the research paper.
