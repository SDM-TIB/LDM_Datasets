To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Explainable Authorship Identification in Cultural Heritage Applications: Analysis of a New Perspective" by Mattia Setzu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's focus on explainable authorship identification (AId) and mentions the use of real AId data for experiments. This indicates that datasets are likely discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets**. In this paper, the relevant information is found in **Section 5 (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors describe the dataset they used for their experiments. They mention that they employed a dataset developed by Corbara et al. (2022), which is divided into two sub-datasets: **MedLatinEpi** and **MedLatinLit**.

1. **MedLatinEpi**: This sub-dataset consists of 294 texts of epistolary genre, primarily from the 13th and 14th centuries.
2. **MedLatinLit**: This sub-dataset contains 30 texts of various nature, including literary works and chronicles.

The authors also specify that they selected five authors for their analysis, which includes Dante Alighieri and Giovanni Boccaccio, among others. They detail how they processed the texts into non-overlapping sequences for their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset mentioned. The relevant citation for the dataset is:

- Corbara, S., Moreo, A., & Sebastiani, F. (2022). MedLatinEpi and MedLatinLit: Two datasets for the computational authorship analysis of medieval Latin texts. *ACM Journal of Computing and Cultural Heritage*, 15(3), 57:1â€“57:15. https://doi.org/10.1145/3485822

With this information, I can now compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations as required.

In summary, I will extract the following datasets from the paper:
- **MedLatinEpi**: 294 texts of epistolary genre.
- **MedLatinLit**: 30 texts of various nature.

I will ensure that each dataset entry includes the full citation as provided above, ready for structured output or further processing.
