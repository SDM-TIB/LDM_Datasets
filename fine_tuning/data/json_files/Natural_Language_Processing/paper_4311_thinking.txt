To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Cyber Insurance Against Cyberattacks on Electric Vehicle Charging Stations" by Samrat Acharya et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the paper uses data from Electric Vehicle Charging Stations (EVCSs) in Manhattan, New York, which suggests that there is a dataset related to this case study.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **case study section** and any **tables or figures** that might summarize data. In the case study, the authors mention using power grid and commercial EVCS data from Manhattan, NY. They also reference specific data sources for Weibull distribution parameters and state transitions related to cyberattacks.

In the **results section**, I will check for any tables that present data, such as Table I and Table II, which provide Weibull distribution parameters and sojourn times for the Semi-Markov Process (SMP) states. These tables are crucial as they summarize the empirical data used in the analysis.

Now, I will compile the datasets identified:

1. **EVCS Data from Manhattan, NY**: This dataset includes operational data from Electric Vehicle Charging Stations in Manhattan, which is used to analyze the impact of cyber insurance on financial losses due to cyberattacks.

2. **Weibull Distribution Parameters for SMP State Transitions**: This dataset includes parameters for modeling the state transitions of cyberattacks on EVCSs, derived from various sources, including the SANS Institute and the Canadian Institute for Cybersecurity.

3. **Sojourn Time and Steady-State Probabilities of SMP States**: This dataset provides the sojourn times and probabilities for different states in the SMP model, which are essential for estimating the probability of cyberattacks.

Next, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the **References section** of the paper:

- For the **EVCS data**, the citation is:
  > Acharya, S., Mieth, R., Konstantinou, C., Karri, R., & Dvorkin, Y. (2023). Cyber Insurance Against Cyberattacks on Electric Vehicle Charging Stations. *IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid*.

- For the **Weibull distribution parameters**, the citation is:
  > SANS Institute. (2019). SANS 2019 Incident Response Survey: Itâ€™s Time for a Change. Retrieved from https://www.sans.org/reading-room/whitepapers/incident/paper/39070.

- For the **sojourn time and steady-state probabilities**, the citation is:
  > Canadian Institute for Cybersecurity. CSE-CIC-IDS2018 on AWS. Retrieved from https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/ids-2018.html.

After gathering all this information, I will ensure that I format the dataset entries correctly and prepare them for structured output, ensuring that each dataset is accompanied by its full citation for clarity and proper attribution.
