To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Unified Frequency-Assisted Transformer Framework for Detecting and Grounding Multi-Modal Manipulation" by Huan Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the "DGM4 dataset," which indicates that a dataset is indeed used in the research. I will look for more details about this dataset in the introduction and experimental sections.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of detecting and grounding multi-modal media manipulation and refer to the DGM4 dataset as a significant resource for their experiments. This reinforces the idea that the DGM4 dataset is central to their work.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (specifically section 4) to gather detailed information about the DGM4 dataset. The authors describe the dataset as containing 230K image-text paired samples, with over 77K pristine pairs and 152K manipulated pairs. They also mention that the dataset includes various types of manipulations, such as face swap, face attribute, text swap, and text attribute.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the DGM4 dataset. The authors reference the dataset as follows:

- For the DGM4 dataset, the citation is:
  > Shao, R., Wu, T., Liu, Z. (2023). Detecting and grounding multi-modal media manipulation. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 6904â€“6913.

Since the DGM4 dataset is the only dataset mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format.

I will create an entry for the DGM4 dataset, ensuring that I include all relevant details such as the number of samples, types of manipulations, and the full citation. This will ensure that the dataset is well-documented and can be referenced appropriately in future work.

After completing this process, I will have a comprehensive entry for the DGM4 dataset ready for inclusion in any structured output or documentation.
