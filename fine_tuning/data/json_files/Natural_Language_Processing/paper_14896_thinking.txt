To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Large Language Models as Source Planner for Personalized Knowledge-grounded Dialogues" by Hongru Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the construction of a personalized knowledge-grounded dialogue dataset called **Knowledge Behind Persona (KBP)**, which is the primary dataset of interest. The introduction further emphasizes the significance of this dataset in studying the dependency between persona and implicit knowledge.

Next, I will look for specific sections that detail the dataset, particularly the **Data Collection** section. Here, the authors describe the process of creating the KBP dataset, including the steps taken for persona and knowledge acquisition, as well as dialogue collection. They provide statistics about the dataset, such as the number of dialogues, samples, and average turns, which confirm its relevance and scale.

In the **Data Collection** section, the authors explicitly state that they constructed the **Knowledge Behind Persona (KBP)** dataset, which consists of 2,477 dialogues and 24,554 utterances. This dataset is designed to evaluate the interaction and dependency between different sources of knowledge in dialogue systems.

Now, I will gather the full citation for the KBP dataset from the references section. However, since the dataset is newly introduced in this paper and does not have a separate citation, I will cite the paper itself as the source of the dataset.

The citation for the dataset is:
> Wang, H., Hu, M., Deng, Y., Wang, R., Mi, F., Wang, W., Wang, Y., Kwan, W.-C., King, I., & Wong, K.-F. (2023). Large Language Models as Source Planner for Personalized Knowledge-grounded Dialogues. *Proceedings of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL)*.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format, ensuring that the citation is included for the KBP dataset. This will provide a clear reference for anyone looking to utilize or understand the dataset in the context of the research presented in the paper.
