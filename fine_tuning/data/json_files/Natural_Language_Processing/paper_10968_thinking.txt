To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Dynamic Neighborhood Construction for Structured Large Discrete Action Spaces" by Fabian Akkerman et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental design sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for benchmarking. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets in relation to the research problem.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, where the authors typically describe their experimental setup in detail. This section is likely to contain explicit mentions of the datasets used, including their names and characteristics. I will look for any subsections that specifically address datasets or experiments, as these will likely provide the most relevant information.

In the **experimental design section**, the authors usually outline the environments and datasets they used for testing their proposed methods. I will pay close attention to any specific datasets mentioned, including their sizes, characteristics, and any relevant details about how they were utilized in the experiments.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial, as proper citation is necessary for academic integrity and allows others to locate the datasets easily. I will ensure that I capture the authors, title, publication venue, and year for each dataset.

For this paper, I anticipate that the authors may have used datasets related to reinforcement learning environments, such as:

1. **Maze Environment**: A common benchmark in reinforcement learning, often described in terms of its structure and the challenges it presents.
2. **Joint Inventory Replenishment Problem**: This may involve datasets related to inventory management and customer demand.
3. **Job-Shop Scheduling Problem**: A well-known problem in operations research, which may have associated datasets for testing scheduling algorithms.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation formatted correctly.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for output, ensuring that they are structured clearly and ready for any required downstream processing or review.
