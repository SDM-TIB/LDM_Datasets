To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Does Your Neural Code Completion Model Use My Code? A Membership Inference Approach" by Yao Wan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract discusses the use of various neural code completion models and hints at the datasets used for training and evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental setup section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for training and testing their models. In this paper, the authors mention using the **Py150 dataset** for training their LSTM-based model and the **Github-Python dataset** for non-member data. 

I will also check the **references section** to find full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with sources for further exploration.

1. **Py150 Dataset**: This dataset is mentioned as comprising 150,000 Python source code files gathered from GitHub repositories. The authors specify that they partition this dataset into subsets for member and non-member data.

2. **Github-Python Dataset**: This dataset is used for non-member data and is described as containing approximately 100,000 deduplicated Python files from GitHub repositories created no earlier than January 1, 2023.

   Citation:
   > GitHub. (2023). GitHub API Documentation. Retrieved from https://docs.github.com/en/rest

After identifying these datasets and their citations, I will compile the information into a structured format that highlights each dataset's name, description, and citation.

This systematic approach ensures that I accurately capture all relevant datasets and provide proper citations, which is essential for academic integrity and further research.
