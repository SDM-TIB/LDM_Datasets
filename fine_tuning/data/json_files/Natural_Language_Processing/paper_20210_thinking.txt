To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Hybrid Kinetics Embedding Framework for Dynamic PET Reconstruction" by Yubo Ye et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study and may mention datasets used for evaluation. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets, while the methodology and experiments sections typically detail the specific datasets employed in the research.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of dynamic PET reconstruction and the importance of leveraging temporal dynamics. However, they do not explicitly mention any datasets at this point.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**. In **section 4.1 (Experiments on Synthetic Data)**, the authors describe the use of the **128 × 128 2D Zubal brain phantom** for generating synthetic data. They mention that this phantom contains 6 regions of interest (ROIs) and that they generated a total of 400 pairs of tracer activity images and sinograms for training, validation, and testing. This indicates that the Zubal brain phantom is a dataset used in their experiments.

In **section 4.2 (Experiments on Real Data)**, the authors state that they used **animal data** obtained from a previous study referenced as [21]. This suggests that there is another dataset involved, but I need to confirm the details by checking the reference.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to retrieve full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. For the **Zubal brain phantom**, the citation is:
   > Zubal, I.G., Harrell, C.R., Smith, E.O., Rattner, Z., Gindi, G., Hoffer, P.B. *Computerized three-dimensional segmented human anatomy*. Medical physics 21(2), 299–302 (1994).

2. For the **animal data**, I will look at reference [21] in the references section, which is:
   > Wang, B., Liu, H. *FBP-Net for direct reconstruction of dynamic PET images*. Physics in Medicine & Biology 65(23), 235008 (2020).

Having identified the datasets and their citations, I will summarize the findings:

- **Dataset 1**: 128 × 128 2D Zubal brain phantom
  - Citation: Zubal, I.G., Harrell, C.R., Smith, E.O., Rattner, Z., Gindi, G., Hoffer, P.B. *Computerized three-dimensional segmented human anatomy*. Medical physics 21(2), 299–302 (1994).

- **Dataset 2**: Animal data from previous study
  - Citation: Wang, B., Liu, H. *FBP-Net for direct reconstruction of dynamic PET images*. Physics in Medicine & Biology 65(23), 235008 (2020).

Now, I will compile these dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
