To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Actionable Cyber Threat Intelligence using Knowledge Graphs and Large Language Models" by Romy Fieblinger et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the use of "state-of-the-art open-source LLMs" and "large-scale dataset for knowledge graph (KG) generation and link prediction," indicating that datasets are likely discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 3.3 (Dataset Generation)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention two datasets:

1. **Annotated CTI Dataset**: This dataset consists of 120 curated Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) reports related to 36 Android malware families from 2015 to 2022. The reports were manually annotated to capture various cyber threat concepts and their relationships.

2. **Large-Scale CTI Dataset**: This dataset comprises approximately 12,000 unstructured open-access CTI reports, which were processed to generate triples for the knowledge graph.

I will also check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The authors refer to a previous work by Alam et al. for the datasets, which is crucial for proper citation.

The citation for the datasets is:
- For the **Annotated CTI Dataset** and **Large-Scale CTI Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Md Tanvirul Alam, D. Bhusal, Y. Park, and N. Rastogi. *Looking Beyond IoCs: Automatically Extracting Attack Patterns from External CTI*. In The 26th International Symposium on Research in Attacks, Intrusions and Defenses (RAID â€™23), 2023.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations as required. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets utilized in the research.
