To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Calibration-then-Calculation: A Variance Reduced Metric Framework" by Yewen Fan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions, but I need to look for specific mentions of datasets in the context of experiments.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experiment Results)**, where the authors describe their experimental setup and the datasets used. In this section, they mention the **Avazu CTR Prediction dataset** as a benchmark dataset for click-through rate predictions. This is a clear indication that a dataset is being utilized.

I will then look for any additional datasets mentioned in the **experiments** or **appendices**. The paper primarily discusses the Avazu dataset, but I will ensure to check if there are any other datasets referenced in the context of experiments or theoretical analysis.

Now, I will gather the necessary details for the **Avazu CTR Prediction dataset**. The authors specify that they used the first 10 million samples from this dataset, which they shuffled and split into training, validation, and test sets. This information is crucial for understanding how the dataset was utilized in their experiments.

Next, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citation for the Avazu dataset. The paper does not provide a direct citation for the dataset itself, but it references the dataset's availability on Kaggle. Therefore, I will use the following citation format for the dataset:

- **Avazu CTR Prediction dataset**: 
  > Avazu CTR Prediction dataset. Available at: https://www.kaggle.com/c/avazu-ctr-prediction.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring that I include the full citation as required. This will allow for proper attribution and facilitate further research or validation by others.

Finally, I will summarize the findings and prepare the dataset entry for inclusion in the structured output format, ensuring clarity and completeness.
