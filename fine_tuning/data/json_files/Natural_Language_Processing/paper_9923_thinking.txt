To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Efficient Fine-tuning of Pre-trained Code Models: An Experimental Study and Beyond" by Ensheng Shi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions conducting experiments on five various downstream tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved. I will look for specific names of datasets in these sections.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental sections**, particularly **Section 3 (Experimental Study)** and **Section 4 (Efficient Fine-tuning)**, where the authors describe the tasks and datasets used. In **Table 1**, the authors provide an overview of the downstream tasks, including the datasets associated with each task. Here are the datasets I will extract:

1. **CodeSearchNet**: This dataset is used for code search tasks and includes Python and Ruby programming languages. The paper states that it contains 251K/9.6K/1K samples for Python and 24.9K/1.4K/1.3K samples for Ruby.

2. **BigCloneBench**: This dataset is utilized for clone detection tasks, containing 901K/416K/416K samples in Java.

3. **CONCODE**: This dataset is used for code generation tasks, with 100K/2K/2K samples.

4. **POJ-104**: This dataset is mentioned for semantic probing, consisting of 104 problems with 500 C/C++ implementations for each problem.

5. **GitHub Java Corpus**: This dataset is used for line-level code completion tasks, with 12K/1.5K/1.5K samples.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **CodeSearchNet**, the citation is:

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations into a structured format for further processing.
