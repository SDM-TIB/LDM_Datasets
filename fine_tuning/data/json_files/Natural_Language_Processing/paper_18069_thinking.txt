To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Reinforcement Learning for Multi-Truck Vehicle Routing Problems with Multi-Leg Demand Routes" by Joshua Levin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the study, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments or results sections** of the paper, as these sections typically detail the datasets used for testing the proposed methods. I will look for any specific names of datasets, descriptions of their contents, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

In this paper, the authors mention that they tested their approach on a real supply chain environment arising in the operations of Aisin Corporation. This indicates that the dataset is likely derived from real-world logistics data, but I need to confirm the specifics.

I will also check the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. If the authors refer to existing datasets, I will ensure to capture the complete citation for each dataset, including the authors, title, publication venue, and year.

After gathering this information, I will compile the datasets into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset entry includes:

1. The name of the dataset.
2. A brief description of the dataset, including its purpose and contents.
3. The full citation for the dataset as found in the references section.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like "Aisin VRP," I would document it as follows:

- **Dataset Name**: Aisin VRP
- **Description**: A dataset representing the supply chain operations of Aisin Corporation, consisting of 21 nodes and approximately 340,000 individual boxes to deliver.
- **Citation**: Joshua Levin, Randall Correll, Takanori Ide, Takafumi Suzuki, Takaho Saito, and Alan Arai. *Deep Reinforcement Learning for Multi-Truck Vehicle Routing Problems with Multi-Leg Demand Routes*. arXiv preprint arXiv:XXXX.XXXX, 2023.

Once I have compiled all the necessary information, I will ensure that it is presented clearly and accurately for any further analysis or processing.
