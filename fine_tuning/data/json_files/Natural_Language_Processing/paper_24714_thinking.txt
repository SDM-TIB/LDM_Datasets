To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Evaluation of Text-to-Video Generation Models: A Dynamics Perspective" by Mingxiang Liao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to look for any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the establishment of a new benchmark comprising text prompts, which suggests that there may be datasets involved in the evaluation process.

Next, I will focus on the **related work section** to see if the authors reference any existing datasets used in their evaluations. They mention using text prompts collected from commonly used datasets, specifically citing **WebVid** and **MSR-VTT**. This indicates that these datasets are relevant to their research.

In the **experiments section**, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets used for generating videos or evaluating the models. The authors discuss the dynamics of existing datasets and their biased distributions, specifically mentioning **WebVid2M** and **MSR-VTT** again, which confirms their significance in the context of the study.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations I need to retrieve are:

1. **WebVid2M**: The authors do not provide a specific citation in the text, but I will look for the original paper or source that introduced this dataset.
2. **MSR-VTT**: The citation is:
   > Jun Xu, Tao Mei, Ting Yao, and Yong Rui. *MSR-VTT: A Large Video Description Dataset for Bridging Video and Language*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 5288â€“5296, 2016.

3. **WebVid**: The authors mention it as a commonly used dataset, but I will need to find the original source or paper that describes this dataset.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for review or further processing, ensuring that all necessary details are included for each dataset identified in the paper.
