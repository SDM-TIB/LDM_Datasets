To extract datasets from the research paper titled "EmoBench: Evaluating the Emotional Intelligence of Large Language Models" by Sahand Sabour et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions the creation of a benchmark called **EMOBENCH**, which suggests that this is a dataset designed for evaluating emotional intelligence in large language models. This is a strong indication that I need to gather details about this dataset.

Next, I will look into the **Methods** or **Datasets** section, which is likely to provide a detailed description of EMOBENCH. Here, I will look for specifics such as the number of questions, the languages available, and the emotional scenarios included in the dataset. The introduction also references the psychological theories that underpin the dataset, which may provide context for its design and purpose.

In the **Experiments** section, I will check for any additional datasets mentioned that may have been used for comparison or evaluation purposes. The authors might reference existing datasets that EMOBENCH builds upon or contrasts with, which could be important for understanding its significance in the field.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for EMOBENCH and any other datasets mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets themselves.

For **EMOBENCH**, the citation is:
> Sahand Sabour, Alvionna S. Sunaryo, Siyang Liu, Zheyuan Zhang, June M. Liu, Jinfeng Zhou, Juanzi Li, Tatia M.C. Lee, Rada Mihalcea, and Minlie Huang. *EmoBench: Evaluating the Emotional Intelligence of Large Language Models*. arXiv preprint arXiv:XXXX.XXXX, 2023.

If the paper references other datasets, such as **MELD**, **DailyDialog**, or **GoEmotions**, I will ensure to extract their citations as well. For example, the citation for **MELD** is:
> Soujanya Poria, Devamanyu Hazarika, Navonil Majumder, Gautam Naik, Erik Cambria, and Rada Mihalcea. *MELD: A Multimodal Multi-Party Dataset for Emotion Recognition in Conversations*. In Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, pages 527â€“536, 2019.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information and citations, I will compile them into a structured format for easy reference. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
