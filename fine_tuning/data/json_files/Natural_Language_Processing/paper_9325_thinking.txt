To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning with Rejection for Abstractive Text Summarization" by Meng Cao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the challenges of noise in training datasets for summarization, which suggests that datasets are likely to be referenced.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention evaluating their method on the **XSUM dataset** and the **XENT dataset**.

1. **XSUM Dataset**: The authors describe it as containing 226,711 online BBC articles, each paired with a single sentence summary. This dataset is split into training, validation, and test sets. The details provided indicate its significance for their experiments.

2. **XENT Dataset**: This dataset is mentioned as containing 800 article and summary pairs sampled from the XSUM test set, annotated for factuality. The authors specify that it is used for fine-grained entity-level factuality analysis.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **XSUM dataset**, the citation is:
  > Shashi Narayan, Shay B. Cohen, and Mirella Lapata. *Don’t give me the details, just the summary! Topic-aware convolutional neural networks for extreme summarization*. In Proceedings of the 2018 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 188–197, Brussels, Belgium, 2018. Association for Computational Linguistics.

- For the **XENT dataset**, the citation is:
  > Meng Cao, Yue Dong, and Jackie Cheung. *Hallucinated but factual! Inspecting the factuality of hallucinations in abstractive summarization*. In Proceedings of the 60th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers), pages 3340–3354, Dublin, Ireland, 2022. Association for Computational Linguistics.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
