To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MerRec: A Large-scale Multipurpose Mercari Dataset for Consumer-to-Consumer Recommendation Systems" by Lichi Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant details, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract introduces **MerRec**, which is described as the first large-scale dataset specifically for C2C recommendations sourced from the Mercari platform. This indicates that the dataset is central to the paper.

Next, I will examine the **methodology** and **experiments** sections, particularly focusing on any dedicated sections that discuss the dataset in detail. In this case, the paper has a section titled **3.1 Dataset Requirement**, where the authors outline the criteria for the MerRec dataset, emphasizing its comprehensive nature and the features it includes.

In the **experiments section**, the authors describe how they utilize the MerRec dataset for various recommendation tasks, confirming its application in real-world scenarios. They mention that the dataset includes millions of users and products over a six-month period, which is crucial for understanding its scale and relevance.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. Since the MerRec dataset is a product of the authors' own research, I will note that it does not have an external citation but is referenced as follows:

- **MerRec Dataset**: 
  > Lichi Li, Sam London, Zainul Abi Din, Tianlong Chen, Zhen Tan, Ajay Daptardar. *MerRec: A Large-scale Multipurpose Mercari Dataset for Consumer-to-Consumer Recommendation Systems*. In Proceedings of the [Conference Name], [Year]. [Link if available].

Since the dataset is proprietary to the authors and does not have a separate publication, I will ensure to format the citation correctly based on the context provided in the paper.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring that I include all relevant details such as the dataset name, description, and citation in a structured format for clarity and future reference. This will allow for easy access and understanding of the dataset's significance in the context of the research.
