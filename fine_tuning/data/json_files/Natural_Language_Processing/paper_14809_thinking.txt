To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Knowledge-enhanced Memory Model for Emotional Support Conversation" by Mengzhao Jia et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and method sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted extensive experiments on a "widely used large-scale dataset," which suggests that a specific dataset is involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 5) where the authors discuss the dataset used for their experiments. They mention the **ESConv dataset** (Liu et al., 2021a) as the primary dataset for their evaluation. This section provides details about the dataset, including the number of conversations and utterances, which confirms its significance in their research.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the ESConv dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:
> Liu, S., Zheng, C., Demasi, O., Sabour, S., Li, Y., Yu, Z., Jiang, Y., & Huang, M. (2021a). *Towards emotional support dialog systems*. In Proceedings of the Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics and the International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing, pages 3469â€“3483. ACL.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the ESConv dataset.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for the ESConv dataset, ensuring that it is ready for review or further processing.
