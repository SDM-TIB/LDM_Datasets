To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "Gaze-directed Vision GNN for Mitigating Shortcut Learning in Medical Image" by Shaoxuan Wu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their method on two public medical image datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experiments and Results)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they state that the proposed GD-ViG was evaluated on two datasets: **SIIM-ACR** and **EGD-CXR**. 

1. **SIIM-ACR Dataset**: The authors describe this dataset as containing 1,170 chest X-ray images, with 268 images having pneumothorax and corresponding gaze data. This dataset is crucial for their experiments.

2. **EGD-CXR Dataset**: This dataset consists of 1,083 chest X-ray images sourced from the MIMIC-CXR dataset. It categorizes the chest images into three categories: Normal, Congestive Heart Failure, and Pneumonia, and also provides gaze data for each image.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **SIIM-ACR Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Zawacki, A., Wu, C., Shih, G., Elliott, J., Fomitchev, M., Husain, M., Paras Lakhani, P., & Culliton, P. (2019). SIIM-ACR pneumothorax segmentation. Retrieved from https://kaggle.com/competitions/siim-acr-pneumothorax-segmentation.

- For the **MIMIC-CXR Dataset**, which is the source of the EGD-CXR dataset, the citation is:
  > Johnson, A.E.W., Pollard, T.J., Berkowitz, S.J., Greenbaum, N.R., Lungren, M.P., Deng, C.Y., Mark, R.G., & Horng, S. (2019). MIMIC-CXR, A de-identified publicly available database of chest radiographs with free-text reports. Scientific Data, 6(1), 317. doi:10.1038/s41597-019-0320-8.

Since the EGD-CXR dataset is derived from MIMIC-CXR, I will use the citation for MIMIC-CXR as the authoritative reference for EGD-CXR.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for both datasets as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research.
