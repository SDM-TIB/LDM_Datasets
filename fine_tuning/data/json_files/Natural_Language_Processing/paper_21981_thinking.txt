To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An Explainable Deep Reinforcement Learning Model for Warfarin Maintenance Dosing Using Policy Distillation and Action Forging" by Sadjad Anzabi Zadeh et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the use of a Proximal Policy Optimization method for warfarin dosing, which suggests that there may be datasets related to patient data or dosing protocols.

Next, I will focus on the **background and significance section** to see if the authors reference any specific datasets or studies that provide data for their research. They mention the **International Warfarin Pharmacogenetics Consortium (IWPC)**, which is a significant dataset with over 6,000 patients, indicating that this dataset is likely used in their work.

In the **material and methods section**, the authors describe their approach to modeling the dosing process and mention using a **PK/PD model** to simulate patient responses to warfarin. This suggests that they may have used synthetic data generated from this model, but I need to confirm if they reference any specific datasets.

I will also check the **experiments section** to see if they mention any datasets used for training or testing their models. They refer to a **90-day dosing trial** and mention generating **2,000 virtual patients** for testing, which indicates that they created a dataset for their experiments.

Finally, I will look at the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The IWPC dataset citation is:
- **International Warfarin Pharmacogenetics Consortium**: Johnson, J. A., Caudle, K. E., Gong, L., et al. "Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) guideline for pharmacogenetics-guided warfarin dosing: 2017 update." *Clinical Pharmacology & Therapeutics*, 102(3), 397-404, 2017. doi:10.1002/cpt.1006.

For the **PK/PD model**, since it is a simulation model rather than a dataset, I will note that it is used to generate patient responses but does not have a formal citation like a traditional dataset.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets utilized in the research.
