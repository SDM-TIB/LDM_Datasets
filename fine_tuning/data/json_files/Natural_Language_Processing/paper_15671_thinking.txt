To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ChineseWebText: Large-Scale High-Quality Chinese Web Text Extracted with Effective Evaluation Model" by Jianghao Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract highlights the release of a dataset called **ChineseWebText**, which is a significant indicator that I should focus on this dataset.

Next, I will look for specific details about the datasets in the **experiments and results sections**. In the introduction, the authors mention that they released **ChineseWebText**, which consists of 1.42 TB of data, and a cleaner subset of **600 GB** with quality exceeding 90%. This gives me the names and sizes of the datasets.

In the **data construction section**, the authors describe the process of creating the **ChineseWebText** dataset and the cleaner subset. They detail the steps taken to filter and evaluate the data, confirming that these are the primary datasets released.

Now, I will check the **references section** for full citations of the datasets mentioned. The paper does not provide a separate citation for the **ChineseWebText** dataset itself, but it does reference other datasets used in the context of their work. However, since **ChineseWebText** is a new dataset created by the authors, I will treat it as a primary dataset and provide a citation for the paper itself.

The citation for the dataset is:
> Jianghao Chen, Pu Jian, Tengxiao Xi, Dongyi Yi, Qianlong Du, Chenglin Ding, Guibo Zhu, Chengqing Zong, Jinqiao Wang, Jiajun Zhang. *ChineseWebText: Large-Scale High-Quality Chinese Web Text Extracted with Effective Evaluation Model*. Preprint.

Now, I will summarize the datasets extracted:

1. **ChineseWebText**: A large-scale dataset consisting of 1.42 TB of high-quality Chinese web text, each text associated with a quality score.
2. **Cleaner Subset**: A subset of the ChineseWebText dataset, containing 600 GB of data with quality exceeding 90%.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing, ensuring that I include the full citation for each dataset as required.
