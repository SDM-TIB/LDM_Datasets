To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Urban Visual Appeal According to ChatGPT: Contrasting AI and Human Insights" by Milad Malekzadeh et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract indicates that the study utilizes **over 1,800 Google Street View images of Helsinki** for urban visual appeal analysis. This suggests that the Google Street View imagery is a primary dataset.

Next, I will examine the **methodology section** (specifically section 4) to gather more details about the dataset. In section 4.2, the authors describe how they acquired **panoramic Google Street View images** from Helsinki through the Google Maps API, specifying that the images were collected between 2009 and 2017. They also mention that they sampled images at 20-meter intervals along the street network, resulting in a total of **1,967 images** used for analysis.

I will also check the **results section** to confirm the dataset's relevance and usage in the study. The authors discuss the alignment between AI-generated ratings and human evaluations based on these images, reinforcing the importance of the dataset in their analysis.

Now, I will look for the **full citation** of the dataset in the **references section**. Since the Google Street View imagery is a widely used dataset, I will provide a citation for the Google Maps API as follows:

- **Google Street View Images**: 
  > Google. *Google Maps API*. Available at: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/streetview/overview

After gathering this information, I will summarize the dataset details:

1. **Dataset Name**: Google Street View Images
   - **Description**: A collection of panoramic images from Google Street View, specifically from Helsinki, Finland, used to analyze urban visual appeal.
   - **Size**: 1,967 images collected between 2009 and 2017.
   - **Citation**: Google. *Google Maps API*. Available at: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/streetview/overview

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference and ensure that the citation is correctly formatted for future use.
