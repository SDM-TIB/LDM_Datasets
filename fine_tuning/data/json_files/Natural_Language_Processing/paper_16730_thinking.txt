To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Exploring Error Bits for Memory Failure Prediction: An In-Depth Correlative Study" by Qiao Yu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and dataset sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study and hints at the use of real-world datasets for evaluations, which is a good starting point.

Next, I will focus on **Section III (Dataset)**, where the authors describe the datasets used in their analysis. Here, they mention that the dataset was obtained from the Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) of a large-scale datacenter. They provide specific details about the datasets, including:

1. **DIMMs with CEs**: The training set includes over 80,000 Double Data Rate 4 (DDR4) DIMMs with Correctable Errors (CEs) recorded over a 9-month period. The test set includes over 30,000 DIMMs with CEs recorded over 3 months.

2. **DIMMs with UEs**: The dataset also includes over 2,000 DIMMs with Uncorrectable Errors (UEs) for the training set and over 1,000 DIMMs for the test set.

The authors provide a comprehensive overview of the dataset, including the number of DIMMs, the timespan of data collection, and the characteristics of the errors recorded.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper does not provide specific citations for the datasets themselves, as they are derived from internal data sources (the BMC logs). However, I will note that the dataset is based on real-world data from a large-scale datacenter, which is a critical aspect of the study.

Since the datasets are not from publicly available sources with formal citations, I will summarize the dataset information as follows:

- **Dataset Name**: DIMMs with CEs
  - Description: Training set includes over 80,000 DDR4 DIMMs with CEs; Test set includes over 30,000 DIMMs with CEs.
  - Source: Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) of a large-scale datacenter.

- **Dataset Name**: DIMMs with UEs
  - Description: Training set includes over 2,000 DIMMs with UEs; Test set includes over 1,000 DIMMs with UEs.
  - Source: Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) of a large-scale datacenter.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for clarity and future reference. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the study, even if they do not have formal citations like those found in publicly available datasets.
