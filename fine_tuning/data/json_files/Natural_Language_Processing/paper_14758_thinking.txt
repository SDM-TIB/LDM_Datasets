To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Statistical properties and privacy guarantees of an original distance-based fully synthetic data generation method" by RÃ©my Chapelle and Bruno Falissard, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, results, and discussion sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's goals and methods, which may include references to datasets.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of sharing data while addressing privacy concerns. They mention the **Open-CESP project**, which aims to provide public access to synthetic datasets derived from research. This suggests that datasets are a central part of the study.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, where the authors describe their synthetic data generation framework. They mention using a "rich epidemiological dataset" for their assessments, which is likely a key dataset. They also refer to the **"Mental Health In Prison" study** conducted by Falissard et al., which provides context for the original dataset used in their evaluations.

In the **results section**, the authors detail the datasets generated from the original dataset, specifically referring to three synthetic datasets labeled **D1, D2, and D3**. They describe how these datasets were created and the methods used to ensure privacy and utility.

Finally, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The original dataset from the "Mental Health In Prison" study is cited as follows:
- Falissard, B., Loze, J. Y., Gasquet, I., Duburc, A., de Beaurepaire, C., Fagnani, F., et al. (2006). Prevalence of mental disorders in French prisons for men. *BMC Psychiatry*, 6(1), 33.

Additionally, the authors mention the **synthpop R package** used for generating synthetic datasets, which is relevant for understanding the methodology but not a dataset itself.

Now, I will compile the identified datasets and their citations:
1. **Original Dataset**: "Mental Health In Prison" study
   - Citation: Falissard, B., Loze, J. Y., Gasquet, I., Duburc, A., de Beaurepaire, C., Fagnani, F., et al. (2006). Prevalence of mental disorders in French prisons for men. *BMC Psychiatry*, 6(1), 33.

2. **Synthetic Datasets**:
   - **D1**: Generated from the original dataset using the CART method.
   - **D2**: Generated from D1 after applying distance-based filtering.
   - **D3**: Generated from D2 after adding noise for privacy protection.

While D1, D2, and D3 are not explicitly cited in the references, they are derived from the original dataset and the methods described in the paper.

After gathering this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for further processing or review.
