To extract datasets from the research paper titled "LLM-PQ: Serving LLM on Heterogeneous Clusters with Phase-Aware Partition and Adaptive Quantization" by Juntao Zhao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract discusses the efficiency of serving large language models (LLMs) on heterogeneous clusters, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. I will then look for any references to datasets in the introduction, where the authors might describe their experimental setup or the data used for evaluation.

Next, I will check the **experiments** section, as this is typically where datasets are detailed. I will look for any subsections that specifically mention datasets or data sources. If the authors conducted experiments, they likely used specific datasets, which should be clearly stated.

In the **background** or **related work** sections, the authors might reference existing datasets used in previous studies or benchmarks relevant to their work. This could provide context for the datasets they chose for their experiments.

If the paper includes a **methodology** or **evaluation** section, I will look for any descriptions of the datasets used for training or testing their proposed method. This section may provide insights into the characteristics of the datasets, such as size, type, and source.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented.

Finally, I will format the extracted information according to the required structure, ready for further processing or review.
