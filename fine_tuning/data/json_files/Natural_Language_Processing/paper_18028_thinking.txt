To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Instilling Multi-round Thinking into Text-guided Image Editing" by Lidong Zeng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the effectiveness of the proposed method on two benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets and Evaluation Metrics)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention:

1. **FashionIQ**: This dataset involves over 17.5k queries for training and 5.5k for evaluation, with each query consisting of a candidate image, text user feedback, and a target image.

2. **Fashion200k**: This dataset consists of over 200k fashion images with corresponding text captions. The authors describe how they constructed triplets for retrieval tasks based on differences between image-caption pairs.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **FashionIQ**, the citation is:
  > Wu, H., Gao, Y., Guo, X., Al-Halah, Z., Rennie, S., Grauman, K., & Feris, R. (2021). Fashion IQ: A new dataset towards retrieving images by natural language feedback. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pp. 11307â€“11317.

- For **Fashion200k**, the citation is:
  > Chen, Y., Zheng, Z., Ji, W., Qu, L., & Chua, T.S. (2024). Composed image retrieval with text feedback via multi-grained uncertainty regularization. ICLR.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
