To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The performance of multiple language models in identifying offensive language on social media" by Hao Li, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract and introduction** sections of the paper. These sections often provide a summary of the research objectives and may mention specific datasets used in the study. In the introduction, the author discusses the use of the **OLID dataset**, which is a key dataset for analyzing offensive language in tweets.

Next, I will look into the **methodology or dataset section** (in this case, section 3.2) to find detailed descriptions of the datasets used. Here, the author provides a comprehensive overview of the **Offensive Language Identification Dataset (OLID)**, including its structure and the hierarchical annotation schema used for categorizing offensive language. The OLID dataset consists of 14,200 tweets and is divided into three levels of classification.

In this section, I will note the specifics of the OLID dataset:
- **Dataset Name**: Offensive Language Identification Dataset (OLID)
- **Description**: A large-scale dataset of English tweets with high-quality annotation of the target and type of offenses, designed to identify offensive language in a comprehensive manner.
- **Citation**: Zampieri, M., Malmasi, S., Nakov, P., Rosenthal, S., Farra, N., & Kumar, R. (2019). Predicting the type and target of offensive posts in social media. *arXiv preprint arXiv:1902.09666*.

After identifying the OLID dataset, I will check the **references section** to ensure that I have the correct citation format and details. This will help me confirm the accuracy of the citation I noted earlier.

Finally, I will compile the extracted dataset information, ensuring that I include the full citation for the OLID dataset as it is crucial for proper attribution in academic work.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and cite the datasets used in the research paper, particularly focusing on the OLID dataset as the primary dataset discussed.
