To extract datasets from the research paper titled "HiMTM: Hierarchical Multi-Scale Masked Time Series Modeling for Long-Term Forecasting" by Shubao Zhao et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on **7 mainstream datasets**, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they mention the following datasets:

1. **ETTh1**: A dataset used for time series forecasting.
2. **ETTh2**: Another dataset similar to ETTh1, also for forecasting.
3. **ETTm1**: A third dataset for time series forecasting.
4. **ETTm2**: A variant of ETTm1.
5. **Weather**: A dataset related to weather forecasting.
6. **Electricity**: A dataset for electricity consumption forecasting.
7. **Traffic**: A dataset for traffic forecasting.

The authors also reference that these datasets are publicly available on the paper by Wu et al. (2021), which is a crucial detail for citation purposes.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset source mentioned (Wu et al., 2021):

- For the datasets, the citation is:
  > Haixu Wu, Jiehui Xu, Jianmin Wang, and Mingsheng Long. *Autoformer: Decomposition transformers with auto-correlation for long-term series forecasting*. Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 34:22419â€“22430, 2021.

With this information, I can now compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for output, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its citation.
