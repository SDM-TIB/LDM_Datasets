To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Feasibility Study on Intra-Grid Location Estimation Using Power ENF Signals" by Ravi Garg et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the study's objectives and any datasets that may be referenced. The abstract mentions the use of power ENF signals collected from various locations, which suggests that there are datasets involved.

Next, I will look for specific sections that typically contain dataset information, such as **section II (Background)** and **section III (Location Dependence of ENF Signals)**. In these sections, the authors describe experiments conducted on power ENF data collected from several locations within the Eastern and Western US grids. This indicates that there are datasets related to these recordings.

In **section III**, the authors mention two case studies involving recordings from multiple locations:
1. **Three-location dataset**: This dataset includes recordings from College Park (MD), Princeton (NJ), and Atlanta (GA).
2. **Five-location dataset**: This dataset expands to include Champaign (IL) and Raleigh (NC) along with the previous three locations.

I will also check the **experiments** and **results** sections for any additional details about the datasets, such as the duration of recordings and the specific methodologies used for data collection.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets or related works mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for the datasets used in the study.

For the datasets identified, I will compile the following information:
- **Dataset Name**: A clear and concise name for each dataset.
- **Description**: A brief description of the dataset, including the number of locations, duration of recordings, and any relevant characteristics.
- **Full Citation**: The complete reference for the dataset or the original work that describes it.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will organize it into a structured format for clarity and ease of understanding. This will ensure that the datasets are accurately represented and properly cited for future reference.
