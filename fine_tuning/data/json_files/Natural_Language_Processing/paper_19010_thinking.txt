To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Approximating Families of Sharp Solutions to Fisher’s Equation with Physics-Informed Neural Networks" by Franz M. Rohrhofer et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study but may not specify datasets. The introduction often discusses the context and significance of the research, which might include references to datasets used in prior studies.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental setup section**. This section typically details the methodologies employed, including any datasets used for training or testing. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

In this paper, the authors mention that they sample data from the analytical solution of Fisher's equation, specifically using labeled data sampled from the analytical solution (Equation 7). This indicates that the dataset is generated rather than sourced from an external repository.

I will also check the **results section** for any additional information about the datasets used in experiments, such as how they were sampled or any specific configurations that were applied.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. In this case, since the dataset is derived from the analytical solution, I will note that the reference for the analytical solution is:

- For the analytical solution of Fisher's equation:
  > Ronald Aylmer Fisher. *The wave of advance of advantageous genes*. Annals of eugenics, 7(4):355–369, 1937.

Since the dataset is generated from the analytical solution, I will document it accordingly.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited. This will include details such as the dataset name, description, and the full citation for the source of the analytical solution.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets used in the research paper.
