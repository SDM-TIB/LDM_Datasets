To extract datasets from the research paper titled "More Robots are Coming: Large Multimodal Models (ChatGPT) can Solve Visually Diverse Images of Parsons Problems" by Irene Y. Hou et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on evaluating large multimodal models on visual assignments, which suggests that datasets are involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the context of using visual programming problems and mention that they created a dataset of Visual Parsons problems based on existing literature. This indicates that there is a specific dataset that I need to extract.

Next, I will look closely at **section 3 (Methodology)**, particularly **subsection 3.1 (Visual Parsons Problems Dataset)**, where the authors detail how they developed their dataset. They mention that they created a dataset of visual Parsons problems based on four commonly referenced Parsons problem generators: **JS-Parsons, Runestone, Epplets, and EvoParsons**. Each of these platforms is described as having distinct visual styles and features.

The authors also state that they selected six Parsons problems from a recent study that assessed LLM performance on text-based Parsons problems. This further confirms the existence of a dataset that is derived from these sources.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to retrieve full citations for the datasets mentioned:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
