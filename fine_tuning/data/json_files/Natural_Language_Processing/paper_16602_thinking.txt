To extract datasets from the research paper titled "LAMM: Language-Assisted Multi-Modal Instruction-Tuning Dataset, Framework, and Benchmark" by Zhenfei Yin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and dataset sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the introduction of a multi-modal instruction tuning dataset, which indicates that datasets are a key focus of the research.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Dataset)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets they created. They mention two main datasets:

1. **Image Instruction Tuning Dataset**: This dataset contains 186,098 image-language instruction-response pairs. The authors describe how they constructed this dataset using images and point clouds from publicly available datasets, along with instructions generated via the GPT-API.

2. **Point Cloud Instruction Tuning Dataset**: This dataset consists of 10,262 point cloud-language instruction-response pairs. Similar to the image dataset, it was constructed using publicly available point cloud data and instructions generated through the GPT-API.

In the **benchmark section**, the authors mention that they evaluate their models using a total of 11 datasets for image tasks and 3 datasets for point cloud tasks. I will need to identify these datasets as well.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper references several datasets, including:

- **COCO Dataset**: 
  > Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, Serge Belongie, James Hays, Pietro Perona, Deva Ramanan, Piotr Dollár, and C. Lawrence Zitnick. *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. 2014.

- **Visual Genome**: 
  > Ranjay Krishna, Yuke Zhu, Oliver Groth, Justin Johnson, Kenji Hata, Joshua Kravitz, Stephanie Chen, Yannis Kalantidis, Li-Jia Li, David A. Shamma, Michael S. Bernstein, and Li Fei-Fei. *Visual Genome: Connecting Language and Vision Using Crowdsourced Dense Image Annotations*. 2016.

- **3RScan**: 
  > Angela Dai, Angel X. Chang, Manolis Savva, Maciej Halber, Thomas Funkhouser, and Matthias Nießner. *ScanNet: Richly-annotated 3D Reconstructions of Indoor Scenes*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2017.

- **CLEVR3D**: 
  > Xu Yan, Zhihao Yuan, Yuhao Du, Yinghong Liao, Yao Guo, Zhen Li, and Shuguang Cui. *CLEVR3D: Compositional Language and Elementary Visual Reasoning for Question Answering in 3D Real-World Scenes*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2112.11691, 2021.

Next, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. 

Finally, I will prepare the structured output that summarizes the datasets extracted from the paper, ensuring clarity and completeness for future reference or processing.
