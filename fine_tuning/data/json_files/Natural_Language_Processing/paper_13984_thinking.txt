To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Context-aware Adversarial Attack on Named Entity Recognition" by Shuguang Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the focus on named entity recognition (NER) and adversarial examples, but it does not specify any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe their experimental setup. In **subsection 4.1 (Experiment Setup)**, they mention evaluating their methods on three commonly-used corpora for NER tasks: **CoNLL03**, **OntoNotes5.0**, and **W-NUT17**. This is a clear indication that these are the datasets used in their experiments.

Now, I will gather detailed descriptions of each dataset from the text:

1. **CoNLL03**: This dataset is referenced as a standard benchmark for named entity recognition tasks. It is widely used in the NLP community.

2. **OntoNotes5.0**: This dataset is also a well-known corpus for NER, providing a rich set of annotations across various domains.

3. **W-NUT17**: This dataset is specifically designed for novel and emerging entity recognition, making it suitable for the authors' experiments.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **CoNLL03**, the citation is:
  > Erik F. Tjong Kim Sang and Fien De Meulder. *Introduction to the CoNLL-2003 shared task: Language-independent named entity recognition*. In Proceedings of the Seventh Conference on Natural Language Learning at HLT-NAACL 2003, pages 142–147.

- For **OntoNotes5.0**, the citation is:
  > Sameer Pradhan, Alessandro Moschitti, Nianwen Xue, Hwee Tou Ng, Anders Björkelund, Olga Uryupina, Yuchen Zhang, and Zhi Zhong. *Towards robust linguistic analysis using OntoNotes*. In Proceedings of the Seventeenth Conference on Computational Natural Language Learning, pages 143–152, 2013.

- For **W-NUT17**, the citation is:
  > Leon Derczynski, Eric Nichols, Marieke van Erp, and Nut Limsopatham. *Results of the WNUT2017 shared task on novel and emerging entity recognition*. In Proceedings of the 3rd Workshop on Noisy User-generated Text, pages 140–147, 2017.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
