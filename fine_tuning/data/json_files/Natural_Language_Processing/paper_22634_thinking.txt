To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Relational DNN Verification With Cross Executional Bound Refinement" by Debangshu Banerjee and Gagandeep Singh, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors performed extensive experiments on popular datasets, which indicates that datasets are likely discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 6) where the authors describe their evaluation methodology. Here, they mention using various datasets for their experiments, specifically referring to "MNIST" and "CIFAR10" as the datasets used for testing their method.

I will also check the **related works section** (Section 2) and the **conclusion** to see if any additional datasets are mentioned or referenced. However, the primary datasets are likely to be found in the experimental section.

Now, I will compile the datasets identified:

1. **MNIST Dataset**: This dataset is a well-known benchmark for image classification tasks, particularly for handwritten digit recognition. The authors likely used it to evaluate the performance of their relational DNN verification method.

2. **CIFAR10 Dataset**: Another widely used dataset in machine learning, CIFAR10 consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes. This dataset is often used for evaluating image classification algorithms.

Next, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for these datasets are typically found in the original papers or documentation associated with them.

- For the **MNIST Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Chris Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998. URL: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/.

- For the **CIFAR10 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009. URL: https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html.

Finally, I will summarize the datasets and their citations in a structured manner, ensuring that each dataset is clearly identified along with its citation for future reference.
