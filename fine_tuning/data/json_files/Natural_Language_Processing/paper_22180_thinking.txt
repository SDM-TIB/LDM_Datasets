To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-intent-aware Session-based Recommendation" by Minjin Choi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the proposed model, MiaSRec, is evaluated on six datasets, which indicates that there are multiple datasets to extract. I will note this down as a key point.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section**, specifically **section 3 (Experiments)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the datasets used. Here, they list the datasets along with their statistics in a table format. I will carefully read through this section to identify the names of the datasets and any relevant details provided.

The datasets mentioned in the paper are:

1. **Diginetica**
2. **Retailrocket**
3. **Yoochoose**
4. **Tmall**
5. **Dressipi**
6. **LastFM**

I will also take note of the statistics provided for each dataset, such as the number of interactions, number of sessions, number of items, and average session length, as this information may be useful for describing the datasets.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial, as the paper may not provide explicit citations for the datasets, and I will need to look for the original sources or relevant papers that describe these datasets.

For example, I will search for the original papers or documentation for each dataset:

- **Diginetica**: I will look for the original dataset paper or documentation that describes how it was collected and its intended use.
- **Retailrocket**: Similarly, I will find the source that provides details about this dataset.
- **Yoochoose**: I will check for the original paper or documentation.
- **Tmall**: I will look for the relevant source.
- **Dressipi**: I will find the original dataset reference.
- **LastFM**: I will search for the citation for this dataset.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, including the dataset names, their descriptions, and full citations, I will compile this into a structured format for easy reference.

Finally, I will ensure that I have accurately captured all relevant details and citations for each dataset, as this is essential for proper attribution and further research.

By following these steps, I will be able to extract and document the datasets used in the research paper effectively.
