To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The Shortcomings of Force-from-Motion in Robot Learning" by Elie Aljalbout et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and discussion sections** to identify any datasets that may be mentioned or implied. The abstract discusses the need for interaction-explicit action spaces in robotic manipulation, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. 

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors reference various works related to learning manipulation skills. However, I need to look for specific datasets used in their experiments or analyses. The introduction does not provide explicit dataset names, so I will continue to the next sections.

In the **discussion section**, the authors mention various approaches and references to other works, but again, no specific datasets are named. 

Since the paper does not explicitly mention any datasets used for experiments or analyses, I will check the **references section** for any papers that might have datasets relevant to the topics discussed. I will look for papers that are cited in the context of robot learning and manipulation tasks.

Upon reviewing the references, I find several papers that could potentially contain datasets:

1. **"Solving Rubik’s Cube with a Robot Hand"** by I. Akkaya et al. (2019) - This paper may include a dataset related to robotic manipulation tasks.
   - Citation: Akkaya, I., Andrychowicz, M., Chociej, M., Litwin, M., McGrew, B., Petron, A., Paino, A., Plappert, M., Powell, G., Ribas, R., et al. "Solving Rubik’s Cube with a Robot Hand." arXiv preprint arXiv:1910.07113, 2019.

2. **"Learning to Centralize Dual-Arm Assembly"** by M. Alles and E. Aljalbout (2022) - This paper might also contain relevant datasets.
   - Citation: Alles, M., & Aljalbout, E. "Learning to Centralize Dual-Arm Assembly." Frontiers in Robotics and AI, vol. 9, 2022.

3. **"Variable Impedance Control in End-Effector Space"** by R. Martín-Martín et al. (2019) - This paper could provide insights into datasets used for reinforcement learning in contact-rich tasks.
   - Citation: Martín-Martín, R., Lee, M. A., Gardner, R., Savarese, S., Bohg, J., & Garg, A. "Variable Impedance Control in End-Effector Space: An Action Space for Reinforcement Learning in Contact-Rich Tasks." In 2019 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS), IEEE, 2019.

4. **"Learning Robotic Manipulation Skills Using an Adaptive Force-Impedance Action Space"** by M. Ulmer et al. (2021) - This paper may also include datasets relevant to the topic.
   - Citation: Ulmer, M., Aljalbout, E., Schwarz, S., & Haddadin, S. "Learning Robotic Manipulation Skills Using an Adaptive Force-Impedance Action Space." arXiv preprint arXiv:2110.09904, 2021.

Since the paper does not provide specific datasets used in their own experiments, I will compile the citations of the relevant papers that may contain datasets related to the themes discussed in the paper.

Now, I will summarize the findings and prepare to present the dataset citations in a structured format for further processing or review.
