To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Consensus Focus for Object Detection and Minority Classes" by Erik Isai Valle Salgado et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, approach, results, and conclusion sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted tests on **synthetic driving datasets**, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **results section**, where the authors explicitly mention three synthetic datasets used for their experiments:

1. **Apollo Synthetic Dataset**: This dataset is noted for having over 273,000 distinct images and is used in the context of autonomous driving. The authors specify that they used two parts of this dataset for their experiments.

2. **FCAV Dataset**: This dataset is mentioned alongside the Apollo Synthetic Dataset, but the paper does not provide specific details about its size or characteristics in the results section.

3. **Virtual KITTY 2 Dataset**: Similar to the FCAV Dataset, this dataset is mentioned without extensive details, but it is included in the context of the experiments conducted.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **Apollo Synthetic Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Baidu Apollo, "Apollo Synthetic Dataset," Baidu, 2020. [Online]. Available: https://developer.apollo.auto/synthetic.html. [Accessed 6 January 2024].

- For the **FCAV Dataset**, the citation is:
  > M. Johnson-Roberson, C. Barto, R. Mehta, S. N. Sridhar, K. Rosaen, and R. Vasudevan, "Driving in the matrix: Can virtual worlds replace human-generated annotations for real world tasks?," in 2017 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA), 2017.

- For the **Virtual KITTY 2 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > A. Gaidon, Q. Wang, Y. Cabon, and E. Vig, "Virtual worlds as proxy for multi-object tracking analysis," in Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2016.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations.
