To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SCIBENCH: Evaluating College-Level Scientific Problem-Solving Abilities of Large Language Models" by Xiaoxuan Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that SCIBENCH contains a curated dataset of collegiate-level scientific problems, which suggests that there is a dataset to extract.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (The SCIBENCH Dataset)**, where the authors describe the dataset construction process. Here, they mention that SCIBENCH includes a total of **869 problems** collected from widely-used textbooks in college-level Chemistry, Physics, and Mathematics courses. This section is crucial as it provides specific details about the dataset.

The authors also mention that the dataset includes a **multimodal subset of 177 problems** that incorporate visual elements, which is another important aspect of the dataset. Additionally, they describe a **closed dataset** that encompasses **103 problems from midterm and final exams** from collegiate Computer Science and Math courses. This indicates that there are multiple components to the SCIBENCH dataset.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find full citations for the textbooks and sources from which the problems were derived. The paper lists several textbooks, including:

1. **Fundamentals of Physics** by Halliday et al. (2013)
2. **Statistical Thermodynamics** by Engel & Reid (2010)
3. **Classical Dynamics of Particles and Systems** by Thornton & Marion (2021)
4. **Quantum Chemistry** by Levine et al. (2009)
5. **Elementary Differential Equations and Boundary Value Problems** by Boyce et al. (2021)
6. **Calculus: Early Transcendentals** by Stewart et al. (2012)
7. **Probability and Statistical Inference** by Hogg et al. (1977)

I will compile the full citations for these textbooks as they are integral to the SCIBENCH dataset.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will summarize the datasets and their citations in a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the SCIBENCH benchmark.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for review or further processing, ensuring that all details are accurate and complete.
