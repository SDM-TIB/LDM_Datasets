To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Modelling the Formation of Peer-to-Peer Trading Coalitions and Prosumer Participation Incentives in Transactive Energy Communities" by Ying Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors used real-world data from two large-scale smart energy trials in the UK, specifically mentioning the **Low Carbon London project** and the **Thames Valley Vision project**. This suggests that these two datasets are crucial for the analysis presented in the paper.

Next, I will look for more detailed descriptions of these datasets in the **experiments or results sections**. In the introduction, the authors mention that they aim to quantify the effects of diversity in consumption profiles using data from the aforementioned projects. This reinforces the importance of these datasets for their analysis.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide specific details about the datasets used:
1. **Thames Valley Vision Dataset**: This dataset consists of anonymized data from 200 households, focusing on their energy consumption patterns.
2. **Low Carbon London Dataset**: This dataset includes data from several thousand households, allowing for a broader analysis of energy consumption behaviors.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. 

- For the **Thames Valley Vision project**, the citation is:
  > UKERC Energy Data Centre. *New Thames Valley Vision - End Point Monitors*. Retrieved from https://ukerc.rl.ac.uk/DC/cgi-bin/edc_search.pl?WantComp=147 (Accessed on 26/10/2023).

- For the **Low Carbon London project**, the citation is:
  > UK Power Networks. *Smartmeter Energy Consumption Data in London Households*. Retrieved from https://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/smartmeter-energy-use-data-in-london-households (Accessed on 26/10/2023).

Having identified the datasets and their citations, I will now compile this information into a structured format for further use.

In summary, the datasets extracted from the paper are:
1. Thames Valley Vision Dataset
2. Low Carbon London Dataset

I will ensure that each dataset entry includes the full citation as specified, which is essential for proper academic referencing and for others to locate the datasets used in this research.
