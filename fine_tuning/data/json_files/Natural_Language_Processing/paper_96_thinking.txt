To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-level Representations for Fine-Grained Typing of Knowledge Base Entities" by Yadollah Yaghoobzadeh and Hinrich Schütze, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the methods and contributions, but the introduction often contains more detailed descriptions of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of knowledge bases (KBs) and mention that they focus on the extraction of entity types. They reference existing datasets but do not provide specific names yet.

Next, I will look into **section 4 (Experimental setup and results)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they state that they use the **FIGMENT dataset** for evaluation, which is part of a version of ClueWeb where Freebase entities are annotated.

The paper describes the FIGMENT dataset in detail, noting that it contains **200,000 Freebase entities mapped to 102 FIGER types**. They also mention that they use specific train, dev, and test partitions for their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the FIGMENT dataset. The relevant citation is:

- For **FIGMENT dataset**:
  > Yadollah Yaghoobzadeh and Hinrich Schütze. *Corpus-level fine-grained entity typing using the contextual information*. In Proceedings of the 2015 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 715–725, Lisbon, Portugal, September. Association for Computational Linguistics.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry for the FIGMENT dataset, ensuring to include the full citation as required.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry in the specified format, ready for further processing or review.
