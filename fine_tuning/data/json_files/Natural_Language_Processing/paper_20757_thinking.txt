To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Altered patterning of neural activity in a tauopathy mouse model" by C. Hoffman et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, results, and discussion sections** of the paper. The abstract often provides a concise summary of the study, including any datasets used. In this case, the abstract discusses the impact of tau-pathology on neuronal activity, which may indicate the use of specific datasets related to mouse models.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, as it typically details the experimental procedures and any datasets utilized. Here, the authors mention that they recorded spike and local field potential (LFP) data from the hippocampal CA1 area of both healthy wild type (WT) and transgenic mouse models of tau pathology (rTg4510). This suggests that the data collected from these mouse models constitutes a dataset.

In the **results section**, I will look for any specific mentions of datasets or data analysis techniques that could indicate the presence of additional datasets. The authors describe various analyses of neuronal activity, including spike trains and LFP waveforms, which may imply that they have compiled datasets from these recordings.

I will also check the **figures and tables** for any supplementary datasets that may not be explicitly mentioned in the text. Figures often contain data visualizations that can provide insights into the datasets used.

Finally, I will consult the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for the datasets used in the study.

Based on my reading, I will identify the following datasets:

1. **Spike and LFP data from WT and rTg4510 mice**: This dataset includes recordings from the hippocampal CA1 area, which are essential for analyzing the impact of tau-pathology on neuronal activity.

2. **Behavioral data related to spatial navigation**: This dataset may include information on the mice's running sessions and their behavior during the experiments.

Now, I will compile the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **rTg4510 mouse model**, the citation is:
  > Ramsden, M., Kotilinek, L., Forster, C., Paulson, J., McGowan, E., SantaCruz, K., Guimaraes, A., Yue, M., Lewis, J., Carlson, G., Hutton, M., & Ashe, K. "Age-dependent neurofibrillary tangle formation, neuron loss, and memory impairment in a mouse model of human tauopathy (P301L)." *Journal of Neuroscience*, 25(46): 10637-47 (2005).

- For the **spike and LFP data collection methods**, the citation is:
  > Hoffman, C., Cheng, J., Ji, D., Dabaghian, Y. "Pattern dynamics and stochasticity of the brain rhythms." *Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences*, 120(14): e2218245120 (2023).

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets and their citations in a structured format for easy reference and further analysis.
