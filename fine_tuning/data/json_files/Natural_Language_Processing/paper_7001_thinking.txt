To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Contextualization for the Organization of Text Documents Streams" by Rui Portocarrero Sarmento et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. In the abstract, the authors refer to using **Reuters** and **COVID-19 emotions** datasets, which indicates that these are the datasets of interest.

Next, I will look closely at **section 3 (Case Study and Evaluation)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention:

1. **Reuters Dataset**: This dataset consists of approximately 2000 news articles, including titles and content, sourced from Reuters news and various blogs. It is noted for its high quality and organization, making it suitable for text mining and NLP tasks.

2. **COVID-19 Emotions Dataset**: This dataset contains emotional responses to COVID-19, comprising 5000 text documents (2500 short texts and 2500 long texts). The authors specify that they used only the long texts for their studies.

In the same section, the authors provide additional context about the datasets, including their structure and the nature of the data, which is useful for understanding how they were utilized in the research.

Now, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Reuters Dataset**, the citation is:
  > David Corney, Dyaa Albakour, Miguel Martinez, and Samir Moussa. *What do a million news articles look like?* In Proceedings of the First International Workshop on Recent Trends in News Information Retrieval co-located with 38th European Conference on Information Retrieval (ECIR 2016), Padua, Italy, March 20, 2016, pages 42â€“47, 2016.

- For the **COVID-19 Emotions Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Bennett Kleinberg, van der Vegt Isabelle, and Maximilian Mozes. *Papers with Code - RWWD Dataset*, Dec 2021. [Online; accessed 7. Dec. 2021].

With this information gathered, I will now compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
