To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DBT-DMAE: An Effective Multivariate Time Series Pre-Train Model under Missing Data" by Kai Zhang, Qinmin Yang, and Chao Li, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on **six real-world datasets**, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly the **Dataset Settings** subsection. Here, the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments:

1. **Appliances Energy Prediction Data (AEPD)**: This dataset is used for prediction-related tasks.
2. **Beijing Multi-Site Air-Quality Data (BMAD)**: Another dataset utilized for prediction tasks.
3. **SML2010 (SML)**: This dataset is also used for prediction tasks.
4. **FaceDetection**: A subset used for classification tasks.
5. **Japanese Vowels**: Another subset for classification tasks.
6. **Spoken Arabic Digits**: The last subset used for classification tasks.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and understanding of the datasets' origins.

- For **Appliances Energy Prediction Data (AEPD)**, the citation is:
  > Asuncion, A., & Newman, D. (2007). UCI machine learning repository.

- For **Beijing Multi-Site Air-Quality Data (BMAD)**, the citation is:

- For **SML2010 (SML)**, the citation is:
  > Bagnall, A., Dau, H. A., Lines, J., Flynn, M., Large, J., Bostrom, A., Southam, P., & Keogh, E. (2018). The UEA multivariate time series classification archive, 2018. arXiv preprint arXiv:1811.00075.

- For **FaceDetection**, the citation is:

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
