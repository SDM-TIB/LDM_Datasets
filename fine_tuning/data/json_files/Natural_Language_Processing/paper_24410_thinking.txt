To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Review of Zero-Shot and Few-Shot AI Algorithms in The Medical Domain" by Maged Badawi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract discusses various techniques in few-shot and zero-shot learning, but I need to look for specific datasets used in the experiments or reviews.

Next, I will examine the **sections that detail the methodologies and experiments**, particularly focusing on any sections that explicitly mention datasets. In this paper, the authors reference several datasets throughout the text, particularly in the context of zero-shot and few-shot learning applications.

I will pay close attention to the **tables** included in the paper, as they often summarize datasets used in various studies. For instance, Table 1 and Table 2 provide a comprehensive overview of datasets utilized in zero-shot and few-shot learning, respectively. I will extract the names of the datasets listed in these tables, along with any relevant details provided.

From the tables, I note the following datasets:

1. **COCO Dataset**: Used in various studies for zero-shot detection.
   - Citation: Lin, T.-Y., Maire, M., Belongie, S., Hays, J., Perona, P., Ramanan, D., Dollár, P., & Zitnick, C. L. (2014). *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. In Computer Vision–ECCV 2014: 13th European Conference, Zurich, Switzerland, September 6-12, 2014, Proceedings, Part V 13 (pp. 740-755). Springer.

2. **MoNuSeg Dataset**: Used for nuclei detection.
   - Citation: Kumar, N., Verma, R., Sharma, S., Bhargava, S., Vahadane, A., & Sethi, A. (2017). *A dataset and a technique for generalized nuclear segmentation for computational pathology*. IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging, 36(7), 1550-1560.

3. **MS-COCO 2014**: Mentioned multiple times for various splits.
   - Citation: Lin, T.-Y., et al. (2014). *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. In Computer Vision–ECCV 2014: 13th European Conference, Zurich, Switzerland, September 6-12, 2014, Proceedings, Part V 13 (pp. 740-755). Springer.

4. **PASCAL VOC**: Used in conjunction with MS-COCO for zero-shot learning.
   - Citation: Everingham, M., Van Gool, L., Williams, C. K., Winn, J., & Zisserman, A. (2010). *The PASCAL Visual Object Classes (VOC) Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 88(2), 303-338.

5. **Gastric Polyps Dataset**: Used for detecting gastric polyps.
   - Citation: Cao, C., Wang, R., Yu, H., Zhang, Y., Yu, Y., & Sun, C. (2021). *Gastric polyp detection in gastroscopic images using deep neural network*. PloS One, 16(4), e0250632.

6. **DeepLesion Dataset**: Contains lesion annotations for medical imaging.
   - Citation: Yan, K., Wang, X., Lu, L., & Summers, R. M. (2018). *DeepLesion: Automated mining of large-scale lesion annotations and universal lesion detection with deep learning*. Journal of Medical Imaging, 5(1), 1-12.

After identifying these datasets, I will ensure to note their full citations as they are crucial for proper referencing. I will compile this information into a structured format for easy access and review.

Finally, I will summarize the findings and ensure that all dataset citations are accurate and complete, ready for inclusion in any further analysis or reporting.
