To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An Overview of Machine Learning-Enabled Optimization for Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces-Aided 6G Networks: From Reinforcement Learning to Large Language Models" by Hao Zhou et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract discusses machine learning techniques and their applications in optimizing RIS-aided 6G networks, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. The introduction also focuses on the theoretical aspects of RIS and machine learning without naming specific datasets.

Next, I will examine the **related works section** (Section II) and the **subsequent sections** to see if any datasets are referenced in the context of experiments or evaluations. In this case, the paper primarily discusses various machine learning algorithms and their applications without detailing specific datasets used for experiments.

Since the paper does not provide any explicit datasets or their citations, I will check the **References section** for any studies that might have utilized datasets relevant to the topics discussed. However, the references mainly cite other research papers and surveys on machine learning and RIS technologies, rather than specific datasets.

After reviewing the entire paper, I conclude that there are no datasets explicitly mentioned or utilized in the experiments of this paper. Therefore, I will not be able to provide any dataset citations as there are none to extract.

In summary, the process involved:
1. Reading the abstract and introduction for initial mentions of datasets.
2. Examining the related works and subsequent sections for any dataset references.
3. Checking the references for potential datasets used in cited studies.
4. Concluding that no datasets are explicitly mentioned in the paper.

Since no datasets were found, I will not create any entries or citations for datasets in this case.
