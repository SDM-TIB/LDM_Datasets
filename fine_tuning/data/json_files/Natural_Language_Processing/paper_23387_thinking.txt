To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The Empirical Impact of Forgetting and Transfer in Continual Visual Odometry" by Paolo Cudrano et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract discusses the focus on visual odometry and lifelong learning, which may imply the use of specific datasets for experiments.

Next, I will examine the **experimental setup section** (Section 4) closely, as it typically contains detailed information about the datasets used. In this section, the authors mention using the **Habitat simulator** to create a dataset consisting of trajectories sampled from 72 photorealistic apartments. This indicates that the dataset is derived from a simulation environment, which is crucial for understanding the context of the experiments.

I will also look for any specific dataset names or references to existing datasets within the text. The authors describe the dataset composition, including the number of frames and actions, which provides further details about the dataset's structure.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The paper references the Habitat simulator, which is essential for the dataset used in the experiments. The citation for the Habitat simulator is:

- **Habitat Simulator**:

In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision, pp. 9339â€“9347, 2019.

Additionally, I will note that the dataset is composed of various trajectories and actions, which are detailed in the paper. The authors provide statistics on the number of frames and collisions, which are important for understanding the dataset's characteristics.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including the name, description, and citation, ensuring that I adhere to the required format for clarity and completeness. This structured approach will help me accurately extract and document the datasets used in the research.
