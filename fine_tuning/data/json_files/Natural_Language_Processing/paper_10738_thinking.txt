To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Neural Natural Language Processing for Long Texts: A Survey on Classification and Summarization" by Dimitrios Tsirmpas et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections that discuss datasets**. The abstract mentions the importance of long document analysis and hints at the existence of publicly available annotated datasets. This suggests that I should look for specific datasets in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 7 (Public Long Document Datasets)**, as this section is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets used in the context of long document analysis. I will carefully extract the names of the datasets, their descriptions, and any relevant statistics provided.

In section 7, the authors list several datasets, including:

1. **arXiv Dataset**: A large dataset of scientific research articles used mainly for summarization, featuring a significant number of documents and user-curated summaries.
   - Citation: Clement, C. B., Bierbaum, M., O’Keeffe, K. P., & Alemi, A. A. (2019). On the use of arXiv as a dataset. *arXiv preprint arXiv:1905.00075*.

2. **PubMed Dataset**: Another large dataset composed of scientific articles, primarily used for summarization and document classification.
   - Citation: SumPubMed. (2021). Summarization dataset of PubMed scientific articles. *Proceedings of the Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics and the International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing: Student Research Workshop*.

3. **BookSum**: A dataset covering fiction books from various domains, requiring summarization of narrative plot events.
   - Citation: Kryściński, W., Rajani, N., Agarwal, D., Xiong, C., & Radev, D. (2022). BookSum: A collection of datasets for long-form narrative summarization. *Proceedings of the Findings of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL)*.

4. **LitBank**: A dataset of English literature works that includes word annotations and co-reference relations.
   - Citation: Bamman, D., Lewke, O., & Mansoor, A. (2020). An annotated dataset of coreference in English literature. *Proceedings of the International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC)*.

5. **SummScreen**: A dataset for summarizing movie transcripts, which includes pairs of transcripts and human-written summaries.
   - Citation: Chen, M., Chu, Z., Wiseman, S., & Gimpel, K. (2021). SummScreen: A dataset for abstractive screenplay summarization.

After identifying these datasets, I will ensure to note down their specific characteristics, such as the number of documents, average document size, and the tasks they are associated with.

Finally, I will compile the extracted information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation as specified. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets discussed in the paper, ready for further analysis or reference.
