To extract datasets from the research paper titled "GPT-4V(ision) for Robotics: Multimodal Task Planning from Human Demonstration" by Naoki Wake et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the use of a public cooking video dataset that was manually labeled for robotic manipulation tasks. This indicates that there is at least one dataset that I need to extract.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (Section IV) where the authors describe their qualitative and quantitative evaluations. Here, they explicitly mention using a "public cooking video dataset" and provide some context about its use in their experiments. I will need to find the exact name of this dataset and any relevant details about it.

In the **experiments section**, the authors state that they manually annotated a small subset of the cooking dataset with task labels. This suggests that the dataset is likely well-known in the field, and I should look for its full citation in the references section.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the complete citation for the cooking video dataset. The authors reference a dataset titled "Human grasping database for activities of daily living with depth, color and kinematic data streams" by Saudabayev et al. This is the dataset I need to document.

The full citation for the dataset is:
> Saudabayev, A., Rysbek, Z., Khassenova, R., & Varol, H. A. (2018). *Human grasping database for activities of daily living with depth, color and kinematic data streams*. Scientific Data, 5(1), 1-13.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the dataset details, including its purpose and any specific characteristics mentioned in the paper. 

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format for clarity and completeness, ensuring that the citation is included as required.
