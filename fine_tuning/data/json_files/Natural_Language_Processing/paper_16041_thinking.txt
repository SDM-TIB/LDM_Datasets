To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Density Steering of Gaussian Mixture Models for Discrete-Time Linear Systems" by Isin M. Balci and Efstathios Bakolas, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract discusses numerical experiments, which may imply the use of datasets, but I need to find specific names or descriptions.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section V) closely, as this is typically where datasets are explicitly mentioned. In this section, the authors describe two numerical experiments:

1. **2-D LQR with GMM Distributions**: This experiment uses a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) for the initial and desired state distributions. However, the paper does not provide a specific dataset name; instead, it describes the parameters used for the GMM.

2. **Integrator on a Plane with General Densities**: Similar to the first experiment, this section describes the initial and desired distributions but does not reference a specific dataset. Instead, it mentions that the initial state distribution is uniform over a defined set, and the desired state distribution is a uniform distribution over the shape of the letter "T".

Since the paper does not cite any external datasets but rather describes the distributions used in the experiments, I will note that there are no formal datasets provided in the traditional sense. Instead, the authors utilize synthetic data generated from Gaussian mixture models and uniform distributions based on specified parameters.

Next, I will check the **References section** to see if any datasets are referenced indirectly through the literature. However, the references primarily cite previous works related to the methods and theories discussed in the paper, rather than specific datasets.

In conclusion, while the paper discusses the use of Gaussian mixture models and uniform distributions for its experiments, it does not provide formal datasets with citations. Therefore, I will summarize the findings as follows:

- **No formal datasets** were extracted from the paper, as the authors used synthetic data generated from specified distributions rather than publicly available datasets.

This approach ensures that I have thoroughly examined the paper for any datasets while adhering to the importance of providing full citations when applicable.
