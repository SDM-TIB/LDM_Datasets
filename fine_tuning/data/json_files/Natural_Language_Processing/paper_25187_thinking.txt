To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Enhancing Few-Shot Stock Trend Prediction with Large Language Models" by Yiqi Deng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract highlights the use of LLMs for stock trend prediction, but I need to look for specific datasets used in the experiments.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of obtaining labeled data for stock trend prediction and mention the use of financial news. However, I need to find specific datasets in the experimental section.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, particularly **subsection 4.1 (Dataset)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention three datasets:

1. **U.S. S&P 500 Dataset**: This dataset consists of 553,666 financial news texts related to the U.S. stock market from 10/2006 to 11/2013, sourced from Bloomberg and Reuters. The authors also mention that they collected historical prices from Yahoo Finance.

2. **CSI-100 Dataset**: This dataset includes 90,361 financial news titles of 78 A-share stocks in the CSI 100 over the period from January 2015 to December 2015. The authors state that they collected prices from Wind.

3. **HK Stocks Dataset**: Similar to the CSI-100, this dataset includes financial news for 13 Hong Kong stocks over the same period as the CSI-100 dataset, also sourced from Wind.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **U.S. S&P 500 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Ding, X., Zhang, Y., Liu, T., & Duan, J. (2015). Deep learning for event-driven stock prediction. In *Twenty-fourth international joint conference on artificial intelligence*.

- For the **CSI-100 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Huang, J., Zhang, Y., Zhang, J., & Zhang, X. (2018). A tensor-based sub-mode coordinate algorithm for stock prediction. In *2018 IEEE Third International Conference on Data Science in Cyberspace*.

- For the **HK Stocks Dataset**, the citation is the same as for the CSI-100 since they were collected using similar methods.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
