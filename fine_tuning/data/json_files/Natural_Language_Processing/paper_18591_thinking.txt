To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Review on Building Blocks of Decentralized Artificial Intelligence" by Vid Kersic and Muhamed Turkanovic, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract provides a high-level overview, and the introduction often outlines the key areas of focus, which may include specific datasets used in the research.

Next, I will examine the **methodology section** closely, as it typically details the research approach and may specify any datasets utilized for analysis or comparison. If the authors mention any datasets here, I will note them down.

Following that, I will look for a **dedicated section on datasets or data sources**. In many research papers, authors will have a section explicitly discussing the datasets they used, including their characteristics, size, and relevance to the study. This section is crucial for gathering detailed information about each dataset.

If the paper includes a **results or discussion section**, I will review it to see if the authors reference any datasets in the context of their findings or analyses. This can provide additional context about how the datasets were used and their significance to the research outcomes.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. It is essential to provide accurate citations, as they lend credibility to the research and allow others to locate the datasets.

For each dataset identified, I will ensure to note:
1. The name of the dataset.
2. A brief description of the dataset, including its purpose and any relevant details (e.g., size, type of data).
3. The full citation as it appears in the references section of the paper.

Once I have compiled all this information, I will organize it clearly, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its citation. This structured approach will help in creating a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
