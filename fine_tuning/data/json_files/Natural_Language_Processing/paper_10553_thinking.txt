To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ESCOXLM-R: Multilingual Taxonomy-driven Pre-training for the Job Market Domain" by Mike Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their model on **9 JAD-related datasets**, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors provide a table (Table 1) listing the datasets used in their experiments. This table includes important details such as the dataset names, languages, licenses, tasks, metrics, and statistics for training, development, and test sets.

From the table, I will extract the following datasets:

1. **SKILLSPAN**: This dataset is used for skill extraction from job postings and includes annotations derived from the ESCO taxonomy. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Mike Zhang, Kristian Nørgaard Jensen, and Barbara Plank. *SkillSpan: Hard and soft skill extraction from English job postings*. In Proceedings of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics, pages 4962–4972, 2022.

2. **SAYFULLINA**: This dataset focuses on soft skill prediction and is a sequence labeling problem. The citation is:
   > Luiza Sayfullina, Eric Malmi, and Juho Kannala. *Learning representations for soft skill matching*. In International Conference on Analysis of Images, Social Networks and Texts, pages 141–152, 2018.

3. **GREEN**: This dataset is for a sentence-level sequence labeling task involving skills and qualifications. The citation is:
   > Thomas Green, Diana Maynard, and Chenghua Lin. *Development of a benchmark corpus to support entity recognition in job descriptions*. In Proceedings of the Language Resources and Evaluation Conference, pages 1201–1208, 2022.

4. **JOBSTACK**: This dataset is used for de-identifying personal data in job vacancies. The citation is:
   > Kristian Nørgaard Jensen, Mike Zhang, and Barbara Plank. *De-identification of privacy-related entities in job postings*. In Proceedings of the Nordic Conference on Computational Linguistics, pages 210–221, 2021.

5. **KOMPETENCER**: This dataset is used for classifying skills according to their ESCO taxonomy code. The citation is:
   > Mike Zhang, Kristian Nørgaard Jensen, and Barbara Plank. *Kompetencer: Fine-grained skill classification in Danish job postings via distant supervision and transfer learning*. In Proceedings of the Language Resources and Evaluation Conference, pages 436–447, 2022.

6. **BHOLA**: This dataset is for multilabel classification of skills in job descriptions. The citation is:
   > Akshay Bhola, Kishaloy Halder, Animesh Prasad, and Min-Yen Kan. *Retrieving skills from job descriptions: A language model based extreme multi-label classification framework*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Computational Linguistics, pages 5832–5842, 2020.

7. **GNEHM**: This dataset is for ICT-related entity recognition in job ads. The citation is:
   > Ann-Sophie Gnehm, Eva Bühlmann, and Simon Clematide. *Evaluation of transfer learning and domain adaptation for analyzing German-speaking job advertisements*. In Proceedings of the Language Resources and Evaluation Conference, pages 3892–3901, 2022.

8. **FIJO**: This dataset is for labeling skill types in French job ads. The citation is:
   > Dena F Mujtaba and Nihar R Mahapatra. *Ethical considerations in AI-based recruitment*. In IEEE International Symposium on Technology and Society, pages 1–7, 2019.

In addition to extracting the dataset names and citations, I will also note the languages and tasks associated with each dataset as they may be relevant for further analysis or processing.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference and ensure that all citations are complete and accurate.
