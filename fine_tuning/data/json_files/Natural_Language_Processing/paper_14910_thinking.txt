To extract the datasets mentioned in the paper titled "Bi-level Adaptation Method for Test-time Adaptive Object Detection" by Chenyu Lin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, method, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the approach and results, but the introduction is likely to contain more specific information about the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention that they used the **SHIFT dataset** for their experiments in VCL Challenges B - Continual Test-time Adaptation. This indicates that there is at least one dataset to extract.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** to gather more details about the dataset. In **section 3.1 (Implementation Details)**, the authors explicitly state that they performed experiments on the **SHIFT dataset**, describing it as the largest synthetic driving video dataset that contains 6 categories and 24 different types of discrete domain conditions grouped into 4 main categories. This confirms the dataset's relevance and provides context for its use.

Now, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citation for the SHIFT dataset. The citation provided in the references is:

> Tao Sun, Mattia Segu, Janis Postels, Yuxuan Wang, Luc Van Gool, Bernt Schiele, Federico Tombari, and Fisher Yu. *Shift: A synthetic driving dataset for continuous multi-task domain adaptation*, 2022.

This citation is crucial for proper attribution and will be included in the dataset entry.

Since the paper primarily discusses the SHIFT dataset, I will focus on this single dataset for extraction. I will compile the information into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and citation.

After gathering all necessary details, I will prepare the dataset entry for review or further processing, ensuring that all information is accurate and complete.
