To extract datasets from the research paper titled "XRL-Bench: A Benchmark for Evaluating and Comparing Explainable Reinforcement Learning Techniques" by Yu Xiong et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to gather initial insights about the datasets. The abstract mentions the introduction of XRL-Bench, which is a benchmark for evaluating explainable reinforcement learning methods, but I need to look for specific datasets.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Overview of XRL-Bench Framework)**, particularly the subsection **3.1 (Environments, Policy Models and Datasets)**. Here, the authors describe the environments and datasets used in their experiments. They mention that the framework incorporates four tabular input environments and two image input environments, which are crucial for understanding the datasets.

The paper lists the following datasets in **Table 1**:

1. **Dunk City Dynasty**: This dataset has a state size of 520, an action size of 52, and contains 18,889 state-action pairs.
2. **Lunar Lander**: This dataset has a state size of 8, an action size of 4, and contains 219,392 state-action pairs.
3. **Cart Pole**: This dataset has a state size of 4, an action size of 2, and contains 125,228 state-action pairs.
4. **Flappy Bird**: This dataset has a state size of 12, an action size of 2, and contains 129,248 state-action pairs.
5. **Break Out**: This dataset has a state size of (3, 84, 84), an action size of 4, and contains 3,776 state-action pairs.
6. **Pong**: This dataset has a state size of (3, 84, 84), an action size of 6, and contains 4,000 state-action pairs.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. However, since these datasets are likely derived from specific environments or games, I will note that the paper does not provide individual citations for each dataset but rather describes them in the context of the XRL-Bench framework.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the dataset names, sizes, and relevant details as described in the paper. The full citation for the paper itself will also be included for reference:

- Yu Xiong, Zhipeng Hu, Ye Huang, Runze Wu, Kai Guan, Xingchen Fang, Ji Jiang, Tianze Zhou, Yujing Hu, Haoyu Liu, Tangjie Lyu, Changjie Fan. 2020. *XRL-Bench: A Benchmark for Evaluating and Comparing Explainable Reinforcement Learning Techniques*. In Woodstock ’18: ACM Symposium on Neural Gaze Detection, June 03–05, 2018, Woodstock, NY. ACM, New York, NY, USA, 10 pages. https://doi.org/10.1145/1122445.1122456

With this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for further processing or review.
