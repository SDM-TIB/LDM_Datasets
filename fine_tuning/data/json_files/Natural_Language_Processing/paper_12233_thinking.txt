To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Generalizable Detection of Urgency of Discussion Forum Posts" by Valdemar Švábenský et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors trained models on an original dataset of 3,503 posts from MOOCs at the University of Pennsylvania and tested them on a separate dataset of 29,604 posts from Stanford University. This indicates that there are at least two datasets to extract.

Next, I will look for specific sections that detail the datasets used, particularly the **Data Collection and Properties** section (3.1). Here, the authors describe the original dataset they collected, which consists of 3,503 forum posts from nine different MOOCs at the University of Pennsylvania. They also mention the characteristics of this dataset, such as the number of posts and the diversity of courses.

In the same section, they refer to the **Stanford MOOCPosts dataset**, which contains 29,604 anonymized, pre-coded posts. This dataset is crucial for evaluating the generalizability of their models.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. For the original dataset from the University of Pennsylvania, the citation is not explicitly provided in the references, but I can summarize it as follows:

- **University of Pennsylvania Dataset**: Original dataset of 3,503 posts collected from MOOCs at the University of Pennsylvania (no formal citation provided).

For the Stanford MOOCPosts dataset, the citation is provided in the references section:

- **Stanford MOOCPosts Dataset**: 
  > Agrawal, A., & Paepcke, A. (2014). *The Stanford MOOC Posts Dataset*. Retrieved from http://infolab.stanford.edu/~paepcke/stanfordMOOCForumPostsSet.tar.gz

After identifying these datasets and their citations, I will ensure that I have accurately captured the details and context in which they were used in the research. This includes noting how the authors utilized the datasets for training and testing their models.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format for easy reference, ensuring that each dataset is clearly identified along with its citation.
