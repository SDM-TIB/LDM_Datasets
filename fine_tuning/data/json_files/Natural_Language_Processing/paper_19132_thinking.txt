To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On Explaining Unfairness: An Overview" by Christos Fragkathoulas et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections that discuss methodologies and experiments** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a general overview of the paper's focus on algorithmic fairness and explainability, but it does not mention specific datasets.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any references to datasets used in the context of fairness and explainability. The introduction discusses various applications of AI and the biases that can arise, but it does not specify any datasets.

I will then look into **Section IV (Explanations for Fairness)** and **Section V (Summary and Future Directions)**, as these sections may discuss methodologies that involve datasets or refer to existing datasets used in the literature. However, upon reviewing these sections, I find that they primarily focus on theoretical frameworks and methodologies rather than specific datasets.

After thoroughly reviewing the paper, I will check the **References section** to see if any datasets are cited indirectly through the literature discussed. This section includes various studies and papers that may have utilized datasets relevant to the topics of fairness and explainability.

In the references, I will look for any papers that are known to introduce or utilize datasets related to fairness in machine learning. For example, I will note the following references that mention datasets:

1. **COMPAS Dataset**: Referenced in the context of recidivism prediction.
   - Citation: Larson, J., Mattu, S., Kirchner, L., & Angwin, J. (2016). How we analyzed the compas recidivism algorithm. ProPublica.

2. **Word Embeddings**: Discussed in relation to gender bias.
   - Citation: Bolukbasi, T., Chang, K., Zou, J. Y., Saligrama, V., & Kalai, A. T. (2016). Man is to computer programmer as woman is to homemaker? debiasing word embeddings. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 29 (pp. 4349–4357).

3. **Health Care Risk Assessment Systems**: Mentioned in the context of bias against black patients.
   - Citation: Obermayer, Z., Powers, B., Vogeli, C., & Mullainathan, S. (2019). Dissecting racial bias in an algorithm used to manage the health of populations. Science, 366(6464).

4. **Job Advertisement Systems**: Referenced in relation to gender bias.
   - Citation: Ali, M., Sapiezynski, P., Bogen, M., Korolova, A., Mislove, A., & Rieke, A. (2019). Discrimination through optimization: How Facebook’s ad delivery can lead to skewed outcomes. CoRR, abs/1904.02095.

Since the paper does not provide specific datasets used in experiments or evaluations, I will compile the references that mention datasets relevant to the themes of fairness and explainability in AI.

Finally, I will ensure that I have accurately documented the citations for each dataset mentioned in the references, as this is crucial for proper attribution and further research.

In summary, I will extract the relevant datasets and their citations from the references section, focusing on those that relate to fairness in AI, even if they are not explicitly labeled as datasets within the paper itself.
