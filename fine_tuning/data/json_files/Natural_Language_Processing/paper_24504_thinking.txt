To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MEDCARE: Advancing Medical LLMs through Decoupling Clinical Alignment and Knowledge Aggregation" by Yusheng Liao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the proposed model, MEDCARE, is designed to achieve state-of-the-art performance on over 20 medical tasks, which suggests that multiple datasets are likely involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they mention several datasets explicitly:

1. **MedQA**: This dataset is used for evaluating medical knowledge and reasoning capabilities. It is specifically mentioned as the Chinese Mainland Medical License Exams.

2. **MMedBench**: This dataset is referenced as the Chinese subset of the Multilingual Medical Benchmark, which is also used for assessing medical knowledge.

3. **CMB**: The authors describe this as a comprehensive multi-level assessment for medical knowledge.

4. **CMExam**: This dataset is identified as the Chinese National Medical Licensing Examination.

5. **CMMLU**: This dataset is noted as a multi-level multi-discipline Chinese evaluation suite for foundation models.

6. **CEval**: This dataset is mentioned as part of the general benchmarks, focusing on medical domain questions.

7. **PLE Pharmacy**: This dataset is part of the 2023 Chinese National Pharmacist Licensure Examination, specifically for the pharmacy track.

8. **PLE TCM**: This dataset is also part of the 2023 Chinese National Pharmacist Licensure Examination, but for the Traditional Chinese Medicine track.

Additionally, for alignment-required tasks, the authors mention:

9. **CBLUE**: This dataset is a Chinese multi-task medical dataset encompassing various medical NLP tasks.

10. **CCTE**: This newly developed dataset is for evaluating clinical tasks, including report generation and image analysis.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to ensure that the datasets can be easily located by others.

- For **MedQA**, the citation is:

- For **CCTE**, the citation is not explicitly provided in the references, as it is a newly developed dataset by the authors.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
