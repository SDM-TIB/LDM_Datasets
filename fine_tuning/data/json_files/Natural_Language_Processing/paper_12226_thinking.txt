To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Enabling Efficient, Reliable Real-World Reinforcement Learning with Approximate Physics-Based Models" by Tyler Westenbroek et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to locate any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

Next, I will look for specific sections that typically contain dataset information, such as **"Experiments"** or **"Datasets"**. In this paper, the authors describe their experiments with two main platforms: the **NVIDIA JetRacer** and the **Go1 Quadrupedal Robot**. I will check these sections for any datasets used in the experiments.

In the **"Experimental Validation"** section, the authors mention using a simplified dynamics model for the NVIDIA JetRacer and the Go1 quadrupedal robot. However, they do not explicitly mention any publicly available datasets. Instead, they describe the models and the experimental setup, which suggests that the data used for training and validation may have been collected from these physical systems rather than from a pre-existing dataset.

Since the paper does not provide specific dataset names or references to publicly available datasets, I will note that the experiments were conducted using real-world data collected from the robots themselves. 

Next, I will check the **References section** to see if any datasets are cited indirectly through the references to other works. However, the references primarily focus on related research and do not point to specific datasets.

In summary, I will document the following points regarding datasets:

1. **NVIDIA JetRacer**: The experiments utilized real-world data collected from the NVIDIA JetRacer, but no specific dataset is cited.
2. **Go1 Quadrupedal Robot**: Similarly, the experiments involved real-world data from the Go1 robot, with no specific dataset mentioned.

Since no formal datasets are provided in the paper, I will conclude that the authors relied on data collected from their experiments rather than using established datasets.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format, ensuring to include any relevant citations from the references that may relate to the methodologies or models used in the experiments, even if they do not directly reference datasets.
