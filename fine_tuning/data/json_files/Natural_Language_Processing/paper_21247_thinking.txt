To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Teaching Llama a New Language Through Cross-Lingual Knowledge Transfer" by Hele-Andra Kuulmets et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** sections to get an overview of the datasets that may be referenced. The abstract mentions the creation of **Alpaca-est**, which is described as the first general task instruction dataset for Estonian. This indicates that there is at least one dataset to extract.

Next, I will examine the **Training Data** section, specifically **3.1 General Task Instructions** and its subsections. Here, the authors discuss two datasets:

1. **Stanford Alpaca**: This dataset is referenced as a general task instruction dataset generated with the Self-Instruct framework. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Taori, R., Gulrajani, I., Zhang, T., Dubois, Y., Li, X., Guestrin, C., Liang, P., & Hashimoto, T. B. (2023). *Stanford Alpaca: An instruction-following llama model*. Retrieved from https://github.com/tatsu-lab/stanford_alpaca.

2. **Alpaca-est**: This is the Estonian version of the Alpaca dataset, created by the authors themselves. Since it is an original contribution, I will cite it as follows:
   > Kuulmets, H.-A., Purason, T., Luhtaru, A., & Fishel, M. (2023). *Alpaca-est: The first general task instruction dataset for Estonian*. Available at: https://github.com/TartuNLP/alpaca-est.

In the **Translation Task Instructions** section (3.2), the authors mention several datasets used for creating translation task instructions:

1. **CCMatrix**: The citation for this dataset is:
   > Schwenk, H., Chaudhary, V., Sun, S., Gong, H., & Guzmán, F. (2021b). *CCMatrix: Mining billions of high-quality parallel sentences on the web*. In Proceedings of the 59th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics and the 11th International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing (Volume 1: Long Papers), pages 6490–6500, Online. Association for Computational Linguistics.

2. **WikiMatrix**: The citation for this dataset is:
   > Schwenk, H., & Tiedemann, J. (2021a). *WikiMatrix: Mining 135M parallel sentences in 1620 language pairs from Wikipedia*. In Proceedings of the 16th Conference of the European Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Main Volume, pages 1351–1361, Online. Association for Computational Linguistics.

3. **OpenSubtitles**: The citation for this dataset is:
   > Lison, P., & Tiedemann, J. (2016). *OpenSubtitles2016: Extracting large parallel corpora from movie and TV subtitles*. In Proceedings of the Tenth International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC’16), pages 923–929, Portorož, Slovenia. European Language Resources Association (ELRA).

4. **Europarl**: The citation for this dataset is:
   > Tiedemann, J. (2012). *Parallel data, tools and interfaces in OPUS*. In Proceedings of the Eighth International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC’12), pages 2214–2218, Istanbul, Turkey. European Language Resources Association (ELRA).

In the **Evaluation Datasets** section (4.3), the authors mention several datasets used for evaluation:

1. **EstQA**: The citation for this dataset is:
   > Käver, A. (2021). *Extractive question answering for Estonian language*. Master’s thesis, Tallinn University of Technology.

2. **EstCOPA**: The citation for this dataset is:
   > Kuulmets, H.-A., Tättar, A., & Fishel, M. (2022). *Estonian language understanding: a case study on the COPA task*. In Proceedings of Baltic HLT 2022, volume 10, page 470–480, Riga, Latvia. Baltic Journal of Modern Computing.

3. **EstGEC-L2**: The citation for this dataset is:
   > Bryant, C., Felice, M., & Briscoe, T. (2019). *The BEA-2019 shared task on grammatical error correction*. In Proceedings of the Fourteenth Workshop on Innovative Use of NLP for Building Educational Applications, pages 52–75, Florence, Italy. Association for Computational Linguistics.

4. **FLORES-200**: The citation for this dataset is:
   > NLLB Team. (2022). *No language left behind: Scaling human-centered machine translation*. In Proceedings of the Seventh Conference on Machine Translation (WMT), pages 46–68, Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates (Hybrid). Association for Computational Linguistics.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
