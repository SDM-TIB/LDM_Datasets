To extract datasets from the research paper titled "No-Regret Learning of Nash Equilibrium for Black-Box Games via Gaussian Processes" by Minbiao Han et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for validation. The introduction typically outlines the context and significance of the research, which might include references to specific datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**. This section usually contains detailed descriptions of the datasets used for testing the proposed methods. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, characteristics, and the context in which they were used.

In this paper, the authors discuss various games and their corresponding utility functions, but they do not explicitly mention any publicly available datasets. Instead, they describe the games used for their experiments, such as the **Saddle game**, **Rock-Paper-Scissors**, **Hotelling's Game**, and the **Marketing Budget Allocation Game**. These are not datasets in the traditional sense but rather game scenarios that serve as experimental setups.

Since the paper does not provide specific datasets with citations, I will note the games as the primary experimental contexts. However, I will also check the **References section** to see if any foundational datasets or related works are cited that could be relevant for future research or replication studies.

For each game mentioned, I will summarize the context in which they were used, but I will not be able to provide full citations for datasets since they are not explicitly stated in the paper.

Finally, I will compile the findings into a structured format, ensuring that I clearly indicate the context of each game used in the experiments, along with any relevant citations from the references that might relate to the methodologies or theoretical underpinnings of the games.

In summary, I will extract the following:

1. **Saddle Game**: A theoretical game used as a running example.
2. **Rock-Paper-Scissors**: A classic game with defined utility functions.
3. **Hotelling's Game**: A market-based game scenario.
4. **Marketing Budget Allocation Game**: A real-world application scenario.

Since no datasets are explicitly cited, I will note that the paper primarily discusses game scenarios rather than traditional datasets. I will ensure to document the context of each game and any relevant references that support the methodologies used in the experiments.
