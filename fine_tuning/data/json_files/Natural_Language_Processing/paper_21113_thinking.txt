To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Complementarity in Human-AI Collaboration: Concept, Sources, and Evidence" by Patrick Hemmer et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to identify any datasets that are explicitly referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will look for any mention of datasets used in the empirical studies.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experimental Studies)**, where the authors describe two experiments. In **experiment 1**, they mention using a dataset from Kaggle for a real estate appraisal task, which includes 15,474 houses with various features. This dataset is crucial for understanding the context of the study.

In **experiment 2**, the authors refer to a dataset provided by Steyvers et al. (2022), which consists of 1,200 images across 16 classes, curated from the ImageNet database. This dataset is also significant for the analysis of capability asymmetry in human-AI collaboration.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the references section of the paper:

1. For the **real estate appraisal dataset** from Kaggle, the citation is:
   > Kaggle. (2019). *House prices and images - SoCal*. Retrieved from https://www.kaggle.com/ted8080/house-prices-and-images-socal (accessed: 2021-08-01).

2. For the **image dataset** used in experiment 2, the citation is:
   > Steyvers, M., Tejeda, H., Kerrigan, G., & Smyth, P. (2022). *Bayesian modeling of human–AI complementarity*. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 119(11):1–7.

After collecting this information, I will summarize the datasets in a clear format, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research, which is essential for reproducibility and further studies in the field of human-AI collaboration.
