To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Predicting Role Relevance with Minimal Domain Expertise in a Financial Domain" by Mayank Kejriwal, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses a word embedding-based architecture and mentions using labeled data provided by the challenge organizers, which suggests that there is a dataset involved.

Next, I will focus on the **Methods and Results** section, particularly where the author discusses the preliminary results and mentions the **FEIII 2017 challenge**. This challenge is crucial as it indicates the use of a specific dataset for predicting role relevance. The author states that they used labeled data provided by the challenge organizers, which implies that this dataset is significant for their experiments.

I will also look for any specific details about the dataset, such as its size, structure, and the nature of the data it contains. The author mentions that the original dataset contained 20 roles, which were combined for better generalization, indicating that the dataset is structured around financial roles.

In the **References section**, I will check for any citations related to the dataset used in the FEIII 2017 challenge. The paper cites a report from the organizing committee of the challenge, which likely contains the necessary details about the dataset.

The relevant citation for the dataset is:
> L. Raschid, D. Burdick, M. Flood, J. Grant, J. Langsam, I. Soboroff, and E. Zotkina. *Financial entity identification and information integration (FEIII) challenge 2017: The report of the organizing committee*. In Proceedings of the Workshop on Data Science for Macro-Modeling (DSMM@SIGMOD), 2017.

Now, I will summarize the dataset information:

1. **FEIII 2017 Challenge Dataset**: This dataset includes labeled data for predicting role relevance in financial contexts, consisting of triples that include financial entities and their associated roles. The dataset is structured around 20 roles, which were simplified to 10 unique roles for the experiments.

With this information, I will prepare to compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing, ensuring that I include the full citation for the dataset as it is critical for proper attribution and reference.
