To extract datasets from the research paper titled "TF-IDF vs Word Embeddings for Morbidity Identification in Clinical Notes: An Initial Study" by Danilo DessÃ¬ et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract, introduction, and dataset description sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on morbidity detection using clinical notes, which suggests that a specific dataset is likely involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Dataset Description)**, where the authors explicitly describe the dataset used for their research. Here, they mention the **n2c2 obesity dataset**, which is crucial for their experiments. I will note the details provided about this dataset, including its contents, structure, and the specific morbidity classes it includes.

The authors describe the dataset as containing clinical records that have been anonymized and include various morbidity classes such as Asthma, CAD, Depression, and others. They also explain how the dataset was prepared for analysis, including the selection of clinical notes based on specific labels.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the n2c2 obesity dataset. The citation for this dataset is typically found in the context of the i2b2 challenge, which is referenced in the paper. I will ensure to include this citation accurately.

The citation for the n2c2 obesity dataset is:
> "n2c2 obesity data." i2b2 Obesity and Co-Morbidity Detection Challenge, 2008. Available at: https://www.i2b2.org/NLP/Obesity/

After gathering this information, I will summarize the dataset details and its citation in a clear format. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the necessary information for downstream processing or review.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring that it includes the dataset name, description, and full citation, ready for any required output format.
