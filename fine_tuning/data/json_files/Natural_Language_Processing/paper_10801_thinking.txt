To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CNN Feature Map Augmentation for Single-Source Domain Generalization" by Aristotelis Ballas and Christos Diou, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors validate their method on several benchmark datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **A. Datasets section** where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention four datasets:

1. **PACS**: This dataset consists of 9,991 images from four distinct domains: Photo, Art, Cartoon, and Sketch, with labels for 7 classes.

2. **VLCS**: This dataset contains 10,729 images across 5 classes, sourced from the PASCAL VOC, LabelMe, Caltech 101, and SUN09 datasets.

3. **Office-Home**: Comprising 15,588 images from four domains (Art, Clipart, Product, and Real-World), this dataset includes 65 classes.

4. **TerraIncognita**: A real-world dataset with 24,788 images of 10 different animals in the wild, taken from four different locations.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **PACS**, the citation is:
  > Li, D., Yang, Y.-Z., Song, Y., & Hospedales, T. M. (2017). *Deeper, broader and artier domain generalization*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV).

- For **VLCS**, the citation is:
  > Torralba, A., & Efros, A. A. (2011). *Unbiased look at dataset bias*. In CVPR 2011.

- For **Office-Home**, the citation is:
  > Venkateswara, H., Eusebio, J., Chakraborty, S., & Panchanathan, S. (2017). *Deep hashing network for unsupervised domain adaptation*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition.

- For **TerraIncognita**, the citation is:
  > Beery, S., Van Horn, G., & Perona, P. (2018). *Recognition in terra incognita*. In Proceedings of the European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV).

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that all relevant details are captured accurately and can be referenced appropriately in future work.
