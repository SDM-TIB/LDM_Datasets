To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Rotation and Permutation for Advanced Outlier Management and Efficient Quantization of LLMs" by Haokun Lin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets used for evaluation or experimentation.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section, where the authors often discuss the context of their research and may mention specific datasets that are relevant to their work. I will look for phrases that indicate the use of datasets, such as "we evaluated on," "we used," or "the following datasets were employed."

I will then focus on the **methodology** and **experiments sections**, as these sections typically contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the experiments. I will look for any subsections specifically titled "Datasets" or similar, where the authors might provide comprehensive details about the datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

For this paper, I will specifically look for datasets mentioned in the context of evaluating the proposed DuQuant method. I will note down the names of the datasets, their descriptions, and the corresponding citations.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I capture all relevant datasets accurately and comprehensively.
