To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Rule Learning as Machine Translation using the Atomic Knowledge Bank" by Kristoffer Æsøy and Ana Ozaki, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors created a dataset for translating natural language rules into logical rules based on the Atomic knowledge bank, which suggests that there are at least two datasets involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (The Atomic Dataset and DKET)**, where the authors describe the datasets in detail. Here, they mention two specific datasets:

1. **Atomic Dataset**: This dataset is created from the Atomic knowledge bank, which contains pairs of natural language statements and their corresponding translations into first-order logic rules. The authors emphasize that this is the first dataset of its kind for this specific translation task.

2. **DKET Dataset**: The authors reference the DKET dataset, which was previously developed for translating natural language definitions into the ALCQ description logic language. They describe how this dataset was created using a handcrafted context-free grammar.

In the **experiments section**, the authors confirm that they used both the Atomic dataset and the DKET dataset for their experiments, providing further validation of their relevance.

Now, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Atomic knowledge bank**, the citation is:
  > Sap, M., Le Bras, R., Allaway, E., Bhagavatula, C., Lourie, N., Rashkin, H., Roof, B., Smith, N.A., Choi, Y. (2019). *Atomic: An atlas of machine commonsense reasoning*. AAAI’19/IAAI’19/EAAI’19, AAAI Press. https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v33i01.33013027

- For the **DKET dataset**, the citation is:
  > Petrucci, G., Rospocher, M., Ghidini, C. (2018). *Expressive ontology learning as neural machine translation*. Journal of Web Semantics, 52-53, 66-82. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.websem.2018.10.002

With this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
