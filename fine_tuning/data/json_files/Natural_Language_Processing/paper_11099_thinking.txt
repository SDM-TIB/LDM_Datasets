To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Heteroskedastic Geospatial Tracking with Distributed Camera Networks" by Colin Samplawski et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** to identify any mention of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors present a novel single-object geospatial tracking dataset, which suggests that a dataset is indeed included.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for further details about the dataset. The introduction mentions the dataset's purpose and its significance in the context of geospatial object tracking, but I need to find specific details about the dataset itself.

I will then focus on **section 3 (Geospatial Tracking Dataset)**, which is likely to contain the most comprehensive information about the dataset. Here, the authors describe the data collection process, the type of data included, and the scenarios under which the data was collected. They mention that the dataset includes high-quality ground truth object locations and video data from a network of four cameras, specifically tracking a remote-controlled vehicle in various lighting conditions.

The dataset is characterized by:
- High-accuracy ground truth object locations collected at 100 samples per second.
- Video data from four camera nodes with partially overlapping views.
- Different scenarios, including normal and low lighting conditions, and environments with occlusions.

The authors also state that this dataset will be released along with the paper, which is important for citation purposes.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. However, since the dataset is novel and created by the authors themselves, it may not have a separate citation in the references. Instead, I will note that the dataset is introduced in the paper itself.

The final dataset entry will include:
- **Dataset Name**: Heteroskedastic Geospatial Tracking Dataset
- **Description**: A dataset for single-object geospatial tracking that includes high-accuracy ground truth object locations and video data from a network of four cameras, collected under various lighting conditions.
- **Citation**: Colin Samplawski, Shiwei Fang, Ziqi Wang, Deepak Ganesan, Mani Srivastava, Benjamin M. Marlin. *Heteroskedastic Geospatial Tracking with Distributed Camera Networks*. In Proceedings of the [Conference Name], [Year].

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format for further processing or review.
