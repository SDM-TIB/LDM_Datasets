To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MEMLA: Enhancing Multilingual Knowledge Editing with Neuron-Masked Low-Rank Adaptation" by Jiakuan Xie et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions the introduction of the **Multilingual Knowledge Editing Benchmark (MKEB)**, which is a clear indication that a dataset is being presented. I will note this down as it is likely the primary dataset discussed in the paper.

Next, I will look into **section 3 (Dataset)**, where the authors provide a detailed explanation of the dataset construction. Here, they describe the MKEB dataset, which encompasses 12 languages and includes various types of prompts for evaluation. I will extract the key details about this dataset, including its purpose, structure, and the languages it covers.

In **section 3.2 (Data Statistics)**, the authors provide quantitative details about the dataset, such as the number of samples and the types of prompts included. This information is crucial for understanding the dataset's scope and utility.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the MKEB dataset. Since the dataset is newly introduced in this paper, it may not have a separate citation but will be referenced as part of the paper itself. Therefore, I will cite the paper as the source of the dataset.

The citation for the dataset will be:
> Jiakuan Xie, Pengfei Cao, Yuheng Chen, Yubo Chen, Kang Liu, and Jun Zhao. *MEMLA: Enhancing Multilingual Knowledge Editing with Neuron-Masked Low-Rank Adaptation*. In Proceedings of the [Conference Name], [Year]. [Additional details if available].

Now, I will compile the extracted information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and citation.

In summary, the steps I will take are:
1. Read the abstract and introduction to identify the dataset.
2. Examine section 3 for detailed information about the MKEB dataset.
3. Gather statistics and descriptions from section 3.2.
4. Locate the citation for the dataset in the References section.
5. Compile the dataset details and citation for final output.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the dataset information from the paper.
