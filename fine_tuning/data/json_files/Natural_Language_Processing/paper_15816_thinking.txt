To extract datasets from the research paper titled "General Framework to Evaluate Unlinkability in Biometric Template Protection Systems" by Marta Gomez-Barrero et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of unlinkability in biometric systems, which suggests that datasets may be involved, especially in the context of experiments.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. This section typically provides details about the datasets used for testing the proposed methods. I will pay attention to any tables or figures that might summarize the datasets or their characteristics.

In the **experimental setup section**, the authors mention using various biometric systems and datasets. I will note the specific datasets referenced, such as:

1. **BioSecure Database**: This dataset is used for the iris, signature, and face systems. It comprises data from 210 different subjects, with multiple samples per subject.

2. **UTFVP Database**: This dataset is used for the fingervein system, containing data from 60 different subjects, with multiple samples collected.

I will then check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For the **BioSecure Database**, the citation is:
> J. Ortega-Garcia, J. Fierrez et al., "The multi-scenario multi-environment BioSecure multimodal database (BMDB)," IEEE Trans. on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, vol. 32, pp. 1097â€“1111, 2010.

For the **UTFVP Database**, the citation is:
> B. Ton and R. Veldhuis, "A high quality finger vascular pattern dataset collected using a custom designed capturing device," in Proc. Int. Conf. on Biometrics, ICB, 2013.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation.

This structured approach will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets used in the research paper, maintaining the integrity of the information and providing proper credit to the original sources.
