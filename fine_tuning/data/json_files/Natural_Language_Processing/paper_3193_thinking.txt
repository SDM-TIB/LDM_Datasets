To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Zero-Shot Audio Classification via Semantic Embeddings" by Huang Xie and Tuomas Virtanen, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions evaluating the proposed method on two datasets: **ESC-50** and **AudioSet**. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for the research.

Next, I will look for detailed descriptions of these datasets in the **experiments section**. In this section, the authors provide specific information about both datasets:

1. **ESC-50**: This dataset is described as a small balanced dataset containing 2,000 single-label audio clips across 50 environmental sound classes. Each sound class is represented by a textual label.

2. **AudioSet**: This is described as a large-scale unbalanced dataset containing roughly 2 million multi-label audio clips covering over 527 sound classes. The authors mention that they only consider single-label classification for their experiments and provide additional sentence descriptions for each sound class.

Now, I will check the **References section** to obtain the full citations for these datasets:

- For **ESC-50**, the citation is:
  > K. J. Piczak, “ESC: Dataset for Environmental Sound Classification,” in Proc. 23rd ACM Int. Conf. Multimedia (MM), 2015, pp. 1015–1018.

- For **AudioSet**, the citation is:
  > J. F. Gemmeke, D. P. W. Ellis, D. Freedman, A. Jansen, W. Lawrence, R. C. Moore, M. Plakal, and M. Ritter, “Audio Set: An ontology and human-labeled dataset for audio events,” in Proc. IEEE Int. Conf. Acoustic., Speech and Signal Process. (ICASSP), 2017, pp. 776–780.

Having gathered all necessary information, I will now compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will prepare the information for structured output or further processing.
