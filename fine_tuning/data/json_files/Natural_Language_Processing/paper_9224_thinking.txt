To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards a User Privacy-Aware Mobile Gaming App Installation Prediction Model" by Ido Zehori et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study involves predicting mobile gaming app installations and mentions the use of a new dataset called **The Bigabid dataset**. This is a strong indication that I need to gather more details about this dataset.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (The Bigabid Dataset)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the dataset. Here, I will note the key characteristics of the dataset, including:

1. **The Bigabid Dataset**: This dataset was collected from real mobile gaming advertising campaigns run through the Bigabid DSP platform. It includes 44,824 mobile gaming app impressions from 227 different mobile apps, resulting in 10,000 clicks and 7,872 app installations. The data were collected over a two-day period in January 2021 and contain numeric variables only.

In addition to The Bigabid dataset, the authors reference two publicly available RTB datasets in the introduction:

2. **iPinYou Dataset**: This dataset is mentioned as being used in previous studies for evaluating methods related to real-time bidding. 

3. **YOYI Dataset**: Similar to the iPinYou dataset, this dataset is also referenced in the context of prior research.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

- For **The Bigabid Dataset**, since it is a proprietary dataset created by the authors, it may not have a formal citation in the references. However, I will note that it is derived from the Bigabid DSP platform.

- For **iPinYou Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Liao, H., Peng, L., Liu, Z., & Shen, X. (2014). iPinYou global RTB bidding algorithm competition dataset. In Proceedings of the Eighth International Workshop on Data Mining for Online Advertising (pp. 1–6).

- For **YOYI Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Ren, K., Zhang, W., Chang, K., Rong, Y., Yu, Y., & Wang, J. (2017). Bidding machine: Learning to bid for directly optimizing profits in display advertising. IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering, 30(4), 645–659.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for the publicly available datasets and note the proprietary nature of The Bigabid dataset. This will ensure that I have a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the study, ready for any further processing or documentation.
