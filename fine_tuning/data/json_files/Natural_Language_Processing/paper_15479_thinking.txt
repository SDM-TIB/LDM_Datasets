To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Review on the Applications of Machine Learning for Tinnitus Diagnosis Using EEG Signals" by Farzaneh Ramezani and Hamidreza Bolhasani, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of machine learning and EEG signals for tinnitus diagnosis, which suggests that datasets related to EEG signals may be involved.

Next, I will focus on the **Review of Related Studies section** and the **Research Method section**. Here, the authors mention analyzing various articles that utilize EEG signals for tinnitus diagnosis. I will look for specific references to datasets used in these studies.

In the **Table 4 (EEG data information)**, the authors provide a summary of the datasets used in the reviewed studies. This table includes crucial details such as the number of participants, age range, recording duration, and frequency channels. The datasets mentioned are:

1. **Dataset from Mohagheghian et al. (2019)**: 
   - Tinnitus: 20, Normal: 10, Age: 18-65, Duration: 5 min, Frequency: 1000 Hz, Channels: 64.

After identifying these datasets, I will ensure to compile the full citations for each dataset as they are critical for proper referencing.

Finally, I will summarize the datasets in a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly identified with its respective citation for future reference.
