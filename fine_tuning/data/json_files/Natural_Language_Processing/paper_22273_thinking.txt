To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Trojans in Large Language Models of Code: A Critical Review through a Trigger-Based Taxonomy" by Aftab Hussain et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a high-level overview, and while it may not list specific datasets, it sets the context for the research.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments and results sections**. These sections typically contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used for experiments. I will look for any tables or figures that summarize the datasets, as well as any specific mentions of datasets in the text.

In this paper, I will pay particular attention to **Table 1**, which lists the papers examined in the review. Each of these papers may reference datasets that were used in their respective studies. I will extract the titles and references of these papers to identify the datasets they utilized.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide a complete context for the datasets used in the research.

For example, if I find that the paper references the "You Autocomplete Me" study, I will look for its citation in the references to ensure I have the complete bibliographic information.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation as found in the references.

Finally, I will organize this information clearly, ready for any further processing or presentation as required.
