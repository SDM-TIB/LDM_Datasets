To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Query-driven Relevant Paragraph Extraction from Legal Judgments" by Santosh T.Y.S.S, Elvin Quero Hernandez, and Matthias Grabmair, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors constructed a specialized dataset from the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) for the task of extracting relevant paragraphs from legal judgments. This suggests that a dataset is indeed present.

Next, I will examine **section 3 (Task & Dataset)**, which is likely to provide detailed information about the dataset creation process. Here, the authors describe how they collected judgments from the ECtHR and curated a query-paragraph relevance dataset using case-law guides from the ECtHR Knowledge Sharing Platform. This section is crucial as it outlines the methodology for dataset construction.

In **subsection 3.1 (Dataset Creation)**, the authors detail the process of acquiring ECtHR judgments and how they parsed these judgments into paragraphs. They also explain how they generated queries based on the case-law guides and collected relevance signals by identifying citations to relevant paragraphs. This indicates that the dataset is specifically designed for query-driven paragraph extraction.

The authors mention that they ended up with **4109 query-judgment pairs** and **708 unique queries**, which provides quantitative details about the dataset. This information is essential for describing the dataset's scope and scale.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The authors mention that their dataset is made available at a specific GitHub repository: 
> "Our dataset is made available at https://github.com/TUMLegalTech/ParagraphRetrievalECHR/"

This repository link serves as the citation for the dataset, as it directs readers to where they can access the dataset.

In summary, I will compile the following dataset information:

1. **Dataset Name**: ECtHR Query-Driven Relevant Paragraph Extraction Dataset
   - **Description**: A dataset constructed from the European Court of Human Rights judgments, containing 4109 query-judgment pairs and 708 unique queries, designed for the task of extracting relevant paragraphs based on legal queries.
   - **Citation**: Santosh T.Y.S.S, Elvin Quero Hernandez, Matthias Grabmair. *Query-driven Relevant Paragraph Extraction from Legal Judgments*. Available at: https://github.com/TUMLegalTech/ParagraphRetrievalECHR/

After gathering all this information, I will ensure that it is presented clearly and accurately, ready for any further processing or review.
