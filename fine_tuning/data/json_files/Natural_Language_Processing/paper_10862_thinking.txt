To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Pentagon-Match (PMatch): Identification of View-Invariant Planar Feature for Local Feature Matching-Based Homography Estimation" by Yueh-Cheng Huang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the use of the **HPatches dataset** for evaluating the proposed method, which indicates that this dataset is relevant.

Next, I will look for specific details about the dataset in the **experiments section**. In section 4.1, the authors explicitly state that they evaluate their homography estimation results on the **HPatches dataset**, which consists of 57 image sequences, each containing six images of the same scene. This section provides a clear description of the dataset's structure and purpose.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the HPatches dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Assileios Balntas, Karel Lenc, Andrea Vedaldi, and Krystian Mikolajczyk. *HPatches: A benchmark and evaluation of handcrafted and learned local descriptors*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2017.

Since the paper primarily focuses on the HPatches dataset, I will compile this information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the dataset as it is crucial for proper attribution.

After gathering all necessary details, I will prepare the dataset entry for the HPatches dataset, ensuring that it is ready for any downstream processing or review.
