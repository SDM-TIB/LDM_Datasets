To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Discovering linguistic (ir)regularities in word embeddings through max-margin separating hyperplanes" by Noel Kennedy et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the experiments, but I need to look for specific dataset names or descriptions.

In the **introduction**, the authors reference the BATS dataset, which is crucial for their experiments. They describe it as containing several categories of relations with 99,200 pairs of related terms. This indicates that BATS is a significant dataset used in their research.

Next, I will check the **methodology section** where they discuss the experimental setup. Here, they confirm that they used the **Bigger Analogy Test Set (BATS)** for evaluating their models. They provide details about the dataset, including the number of examples per category and the types of relations it covers.

Now, I will look at the **references section** to find the full citation for the BATS dataset. The relevant citation is:

- For **BATS**:
  > Anna Gladkova, Aleksandr Drozd, and Satoshi Matsuoka. *Analogy-based detection of morphological and semantic relations with word embeddings: what works and what doesn’t*. In Proceedings of the NAACL Student Research Workshop, pages 8–15, 2016.

Since BATS is the only dataset explicitly mentioned and utilized in the experiments, I will compile this information into a structured format.

Finally, I will ensure that I have accurately captured the dataset's name, description, and citation, ready for further processing or review.
