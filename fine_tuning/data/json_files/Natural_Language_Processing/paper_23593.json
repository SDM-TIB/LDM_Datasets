Each subject has a total of 8 live videos and a maximum of 20 spoof videos, resulting in a dataset comprising 4,478 videos in total. All videos are captured at a frame rate of 30 frames per second (fps), with an approximate duration of 15 seconds and a resolution of 1080P HD. The live videos were recorded during four sessions, exhibiting variations in distance, pose, illumination, and expression. The spoof videos were gathered using various attack methods such as printed paper and replay.",
