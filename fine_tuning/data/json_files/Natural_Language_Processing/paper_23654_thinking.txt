To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Federated Representation Learning in the Under-Parameterized Regime" by Renpu Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental results sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments using **synthetic datasets** and **real-world datasets**, which indicates that there are datasets to extract.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors describe their empirical evaluations. In this section, they specifically mention the use of **CIFAR-10** and **CIFAR-100** datasets for their experiments. I will note down the details provided about these datasets, including their purpose and any relevant characteristics mentioned in the paper.

1. **CIFAR-10 Dataset**: This dataset is commonly used for image classification tasks and consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes. The authors mention that they used this dataset to evaluate the performance of their proposed method.

2. **CIFAR-100 Dataset**: Similar to CIFAR-10, this dataset contains 60,000 images but is divided into 100 classes. The authors also utilized this dataset for their experiments, highlighting its complexity compared to CIFAR-10.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the CIFAR datasets are as follows:

- For **CIFAR-10 Dataset**:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009.

- For **CIFAR-100 Dataset**:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations as required. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant details about the datasets used in the research paper.
