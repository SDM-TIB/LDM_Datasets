To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Biomedical and Clinical Language Models for Spanish: On the Benefits of Domain-Specific Pretraining in a Mid-Resource Scenario" by Casimiro Pio Carrino et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of models on Named Entity Recognition (NER) tasks, which suggests that specific datasets are likely involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Downstream NER tasks)**, where the authors explicitly mention three datasets used for evaluation:

1. **PharmaCoNER**: This dataset is described as a collection of clinical case report sections derived from open-access Spanish medical publications, containing 1,000 clinical cases and 396,988 words, with 7,624 entity mentions across four different mention types.

2. **CANTEMIST**: This dataset consists of 1,301 oncological case reports written in Spanish, totaling 63,016 sentences and 1,093,501 tokens. It focuses on named entity recognition of tumor morphology.

3. **ICTUSnet**: This dataset includes 1,006 hospital discharge reports from patients admitted for stroke across 18 Spanish hospitals, containing over 79,000 annotations for 51 different kinds of variables.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **PharmaCoNER**, the citation is:
  > Aitor Gonzalez-Agirre, Montserrat Marimon, Ander Intxaurrondo, Obdulia Rabal, Marta Villegas, and Martin Krallinger. *PharmaCoNER: Pharmacological substances, compounds and proteins named entity recognition track*. In Proceedings of The 5th Workshop on BioNLP Open Shared Tasks, pages 1–10, Hong Kong, China, November 2019.

- For **CANTEMIST**, the citation is:
  > A Miranda-Escalada, E Farré, and M Krallinger. *Named entity recognition, concept normalization and clinical coding: Overview of the cantemist track for cancer text mining in Spanish, corpus, guidelines, methods and results*.

- For **ICTUSnet**, the citation is:
  > ICTUSnet project. *ICTUSnet: A project for the development of an information extraction system for stroke patients*. Available at: https://ictusnet-sudoe.eu/es/.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their respective references.
