To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Enhancing Software-Related Information Extraction via Single-Choice Question Answering with Large Language Models" by Wolfgang Otto et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and related work sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned. The abstract mentions participation in the Shared Task on Software Mentions Disambiguation (SOMD) and highlights the use of specific datasets, which indicates that there are datasets relevant to the research.

Next, I will focus on the **related work section** where the authors mention two significant datasets: 

1. **Softcite Dataset**: This dataset is described as a gold-standard dataset for extracting software mentions from biomedical and economic research. It is crucial to note its relevance to the study.

2. **SoMeSci Knowledge Graph**: This dataset includes software mentions in scientific articles with relation labels such as version, developer, and citations. This dataset is also highlighted as significant for the research.

I will then check the **experiments section** to confirm that these datasets were indeed used in the experiments. The authors discuss the SOMD shared task and the datasets used for various subtasks, which reinforces the importance of the Softcite and SoMeSci datasets.

After confirming the datasets, I will look at the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **Softcite Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Du, C.F., Cohoon, J., Lopez, P., Howison, J. (2021). *Softcite dataset: A dataset of software mentions in biomedical and economic research publications*. Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology, 72, 870–884. https://doi.org/10.1002/asi.24454

- For the **SoMeSci Knowledge Graph**, the citation is:
  > Schindler, D., Bensmann, F., Dietze, S., Krüger, F. (2021). *SoMeSci - A 5 star open data gold standard knowledge graph of software mentions in scientific articles*. Proceedings of the 30th ACM International Conference on Information & Knowledge Management, 4574–4583. https://doi.org/10.1145/3459637.3482017

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
