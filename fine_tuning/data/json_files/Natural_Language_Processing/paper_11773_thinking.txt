To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Federated Generative Learning with Foundation Models" by Jie Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors validate their framework through extensive experiments conducted on **12 datasets**, which indicates that multiple datasets are involved. I will look for specific names of these datasets.

Next, I will examine the **experimental results section** (Section 3) closely, as it typically contains detailed information about the datasets used in the experiments. In this section, the authors mention several datasets, including:

1. **ImageNette**: A subset of ImageNet containing 10 classes, used for image classification tasks.
2. **ImageFruit**: Another subset of ImageNet with 10 classes focused on fruit images.
3. **ImageYellow**: A subset of ImageNet with 10 classes, likely focused on yellow-colored objects.
4. **ImageSquawk**: A subset of ImageNet with 10 classes related to birds.
5. **ImageNet100**: A larger subset of ImageNet containing 100 classes.
6. **DomainNet**: A dataset with diverse distributions of natural images from six distinct domains.
7. **EuroSAT**: A dataset derived from Sentinel-2 satellite images for land use classification.
8. **COVID-19 X-rays**: A dataset for classifying COVID-19 related chest X-ray images.
9. **BloodMNIST**: A dataset of images of blood cells for classification tasks.
10. **DermaMNIST**: A dataset of dermatoscopic images for skin lesion classification.

I will also check the **dataset description section** (Section 6.1.2) for detailed descriptions of these datasets, including their characteristics and the number of classes.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. Here are the citations I will include:

Once I have gathered all the necessary information and citations, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for easy reference and further processing.
