To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "FactLLaMA: Optimizing Instruction-Following Language Models with External Knowledge for Automated Fact-Checking" by Tsun-Hin Cheung and Kin-Man Lam, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on two widely used fact-checking datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental setups and results section** (Section IV), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they explicitly mention two datasets:

1. **RAWFC Dataset**: This dataset consists of 2,012 claims related to factual verification tasks, with labels indicating whether the claims are true, false, or half-true. The claims are sourced from Snopes.com.

2. **LIAR Dataset**: This dataset contains 12,836 political statements fact-checked by PolitiFact.com, with each statement labeled as true, mostly true, half-true, barely true, false, or pants-on-fire.

To ensure I have the correct details, I will also check the **References section** for full citations of these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For the **RAWFC Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Z. Yang, J. Ma, H. Chen, H. Lin, Z. Luo, and Y. Chang. *A Coarse-to-fine Cascaded Evidence-Distillation Neural Network for Explainable Fake News Detection*. In Proceedings of the 29th International Conference on Computational Linguistics, Gyeongju, Republic of Korea, 2019.

- For the **LIAR Dataset**, the citation is:
  > W. Y. Wang. *'Liar, liar pants on fire': A new benchmark dataset for fake news detection*. In ACL 2017 - 55th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, Proceedings of the Conference (Long Papers), 2017.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their proper citations.
