To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Touch the Core: Exploring Task Dependence Among Hybrid Targets for Recommendation" by Xing Tang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract states that extensive experiments were conducted on "two offline public datasets and one real-world industrial dataset," which indicates that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 5) where the authors describe their experimental setup. Here, they explicitly mention the datasets used:

1. **KuaiRand Dataset**: This dataset is described as an unbiased sequential recommendation dataset collected from a video-sharing mobile app. It includes various user behaviors such as clicking, sharing, and liking. The authors specify that they use the KuaiRand-pure version and define three hybrid targets: click, long view, and watch time.

2. **Kaggle-Revenue Dataset**: This dataset is from the Kaggle Acquire Valued Shoppers Challenge and contains complete basket-level shopping history for customers. The authors define three hybrid behaviors from this dataset: user repurchase in one year, user repurchase in one month, and the amount of user repurchase in one month.

3. **Product Dataset**: This dataset is collected from the recommendation logs of an online fund recommendation platform over three months. The authors define three hybrid targets: click, purchase, and the amount of purchase.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **KuaiRand Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Chongming Gao, Shijun Li, Yuan Zhang, Jiawei Chen, Biao Li, Wenqiang Lei, Peng Jiang, and Xiangnan He. 2022. *KuaiRand: An Unbiased Sequential Recommendation Dataset with Randomly Exposed Videos*. In Proceedings of the 31st ACM International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management (CIKM ’22). ACM, Atlanta, GA, USA, 3953–3957.

- For the **Kaggle-Revenue Dataset**, the citation is:
  > The Kaggle Acquire Valued Shoppers Challenge dataset is referenced as part of the competition materials and does not have a formal citation in the paper. However, it can be cited as:
  > Kaggle. 2018. *Kaggle Acquire Valued Shoppers Challenge*. Retrieved from https://www.kaggle.com/c/acquire-valued-shoppers-challenge.

- For the **Product Dataset**, the citation is not explicitly provided in the references, but it can be described as:
  > Product dataset collected from the recommendation logs of an online fund recommendation platform (specific citation details may need to be obtained from the authors or the platform).

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations into a structured format for further processing or review.
