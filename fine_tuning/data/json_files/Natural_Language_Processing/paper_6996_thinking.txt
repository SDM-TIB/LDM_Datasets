To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Physically Inspired Constraint for Unsupervised Regularized Ultrasound Elastography" by Ali K. Z. Tehrani and Hassan Rivaz, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any explicit references to datasets used for experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **data collection section (2.4)**, where the authors describe the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention two specific datasets:

1. **Experimental Phantom Dataset**: This dataset consists of data collected from a tissue-mimicking breast phantom (Model 059, CIRS: Tissue Simulation & Phantom Technology, Norfolk, VA). The authors provide details about the elastic modulus of the phantom and the ultrasound machine used for data collection.

2. **In Vivo Dataset**: This dataset was collected using a research Antares Siemens system from patients with liver cancer during open-surgical RF thermal ablation at Johns Hopkins Hospital. The authors mention that the institutional review board approved the study and that they selected 600 RF frame pairs for training.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. However, since the datasets are specific to the study and do not have separate publications, I will summarize the details as follows:

- For the **Experimental Phantom Dataset**, I will note:
  > CIRS: Tissue Simulation & Phantom Technology. *Model 059: Tissue-Mimicking Breast Phantom*. Norfolk, VA.

- For the **In Vivo Dataset**, I will summarize:
  > Data collected from patients with liver cancer during open-surgical RF thermal ablation at Johns Hopkins Hospital, approved by the institutional review board.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include all relevant details and citations in a structured format for further processing or review. This will help in maintaining clarity and ensuring that the datasets are properly attributed.
