To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Conditional Pseudo-Reversible Normalizing Flow for Surrogate Modeling in Quantifying Uncertainty Propagation" by Minglei Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the model utilizes a dataset consisting of input-output pairs without requiring prior knowledge about noise and the function. This indicates that there is a dataset involved, but I need to find specific details about it.

Next, I will look into **section 3 (The pseudo-reversible normalizing flow (PR-NF) for learning conditional PDFs)**, where the authors define the training dataset as \( D_{\text{train}} := \{ x^{(n)}, y^{(n)} \}_{n=1}^{N} \) with \( y^{(n)} = f(x^{(n)}) + \epsilon^{(n)} \). This section provides a clear definition of the dataset used for training the model, which consists of input-output pairs generated from a physical model.

In **section 5 (Numerical examples)**, the authors describe various numerical experiments, including a synthetic example and an application to a geologic carbon storage problem. They mention generating a training dataset based on 20K samples of variable \( x^{(i)} \) uniformly generated in a specific domain, which further confirms the existence of a dataset.

Now, I will compile the details of the datasets mentioned in the paper:

1. **Training Dataset for PR-NF Model**: 
   - Description: The dataset consists of input-output pairs where \( y^{(n)} = f(x^{(n)}) + \epsilon^{(n)} \). The inputs \( x \) are uniformly generated in the domain \( D = [0, 1] \).
   - Size: 20,000 samples.
   - Citation: Not explicitly cited in the paper, but the authors refer to their own generated dataset based on their model.

2. **Geologic Carbon Storage Dataset**:
   - Description: This dataset is derived from a physics-based reservoir simulation model representing a fluvial depositional environment, specifically the Gulf of Mexico High Island 24L. It includes pressure distributions over time based on CO2 injection.
   - Size: 108 simulations collected every two months over 30 years, each consisting of 180 time steps.
   - Citation: The simulation model is based on the work of CMG (Computer Modeling Group), which is referenced in the paper.

Next, I will ensure to document the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

- For the **training dataset** used in the PR-NF model, since it is generated by the authors, I will note it as:
  > Yang, M., Wang, P., Fan, M., Lu, D., Cao, Y., & Zhang, G. (2023). Conditional Pseudo-Reversible Normalizing Flow for Surrogate Modeling in Quantifying Uncertainty Propagation. *arXiv preprint arXiv:2306.05580*.

- For the **geologic carbon storage dataset**, I will cite the CMG user’s guide as follows:
  > CMG. (2022). *CMG GEM User’s Guide*. Calgary, Alberta, Canada: Computer Modeling Group Ltd.

Finally, I will compile these findings into a structured format for easy reference and ensure that the citations are complete and accurate for each dataset identified in the paper.
