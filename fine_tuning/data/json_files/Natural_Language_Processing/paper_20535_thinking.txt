To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SPTNet: An Efficient Alternative Framework for Generalized Category Discovery with Spatial Prompt Tuning" by Hongjun Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors evaluate their method on standard benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4), where the authors typically provide detailed information about the datasets used. In this section, they mention evaluating their method on three generic image recognition datasets: **CIFAR-10**, **CIFAR-100**, and **ImageNet-100**. Additionally, they refer to fine-grained datasets including **CUB**, **Stanford Cars**, **FGVC-Aircraft**, and **Herbarium-19**.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for the datasets used in the research.

The full citations for the datasets mentioned in the paper are as follows:

1. **CIFAR-10**:
   > Krizhevsky, A., Hinton, G. E., et al. (2009). *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. 

2. **CIFAR-100**:
   > Krizhevsky, A., Hinton, G. E., et al. (2009). *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*.

3. **ImageNet-100**:
   > Tian, Y., Krishnan, D., & Isola, P. (2020). *Contrastive multiview coding*. In ECCV.

4. **CUB (Caltech-UCSD Birds 200)**:
   > Welinder, P., Branson, S., Mita, T., Wah, C., Schroff, F., Belongie, S., & Perona, P. (2010). *Caltech-UCSD Birds 200*. 

5. **Stanford Cars**:
   > Krause, J., Stark, M., Deng, J., & Fei-Fei, L. (2013). *3D object representations for fine-grained categorization*. In ICCV workshop.

6. **FGVC-Aircraft**:
   > Maji, S., Rahtu, E., Kannala, J., Blaschko, M., & Vedaldi, A. (2013). *Fine-grained visual classification of aircraft*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1306.5151.

7. **Herbarium-19**:
   > Tan, Y., Liu, Y., Ambrose, B., Tulig, M., & Belongie, S. (2019). *The herbarium challenge 2019 dataset*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1906.05372.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
