To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Video-based Visible-Infrared Person Re-Identification with Auxiliary Samples" by Yunhao Du et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors contribute a new dataset called **BUPTCampus**, which is a significant clue that I should focus on this dataset.

Next, I will look for specific details about the **BUPTCampus dataset** in the **methodology section**. The authors describe it as a large-scale dataset with 3,080 identities, 16,826 tracklets, and 1,869,066 images. They also highlight its unique features, such as the inclusion of pixel-aligned RGB/IR sample pairs and auxiliary samples.

In the **related work section**, the authors mention other datasets relevant to their research, including:

1. **SYSU-MM01**: A dataset previously used for visible-infrared person re-identification.
2. **RegDB**: Another dataset that contains RGB-IR sample pairs.
3. **LLCM**: A low-light VI-ReID dataset.
4. **HITZS-VCM**: A video-based VI-ReID dataset.

I will need to gather full citations for these datasets from the **references section** of the paper. 

The citations I will extract are:

- For **BUPTCampus**, since it is a new dataset introduced in this paper, I will cite it as:
  > Yunhao Du, Cheng Lei, Zhicheng Zhao, Yuan Dong, and Fei Su. *Video-based Visible-Infrared Person Re-Identification with Auxiliary Samples*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2023.

- For **SYSU-MM01**, the citation is:
  > Wu, A., Zheng, W.S., Yu, H.X., Gong, S., Lai, J. *RGB-infrared cross-modality person re-identification*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2017.

- For **RegDB**, the citation is:
  > Nguyen, D.T., Hong, H.G., Kim, K.W., Park, K.R. *Person recognition system based on a combination of body images from visible light and thermal cameras*. Sensors, 2017.

- For **LLCM**, the citation is:
  > Zhang, Y., Wang, H. *Diverse embedding expansion network and low-light cross-modality benchmark for visible-infrared person re-identification*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2303.14481, 2023.

- For **HITZS-VCM**, the citation is:
  > Lin, X., Li, J., Ma, Z., Li, H., Li, S., Xu, K., Lu, G., Zhang, D. *Learning modal-invariant and temporal-memory for video-based visible-infrared person re-identification*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2022.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details or datasets mentioned in the paper.
