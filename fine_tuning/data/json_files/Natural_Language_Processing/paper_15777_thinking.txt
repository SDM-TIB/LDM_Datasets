To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Loss Balancing for Fair Supervised Learning" by Mohammad Mahdi Khalili et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of supervised learning models and fairness issues but does not explicitly mention any datasets. The introduction also focuses on the problem of bias in machine learning but does not provide specific dataset names.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section 6) closely, as this is where datasets are typically detailed. In this section, the authors mention conducting experiments on two real-world datasets:

1. **Law School Admission Dataset**: This dataset includes information about 21,790 law students studying in 163 different law schools across the United States. It contains entrance exam scores (LSAT), GPA prior to law school, and first-year average grades (FYA). The goal is to train a γ-EL fair regularized linear regression model to estimate the FYA of students based on their LSAT and GPA.

2. **Adult Income Dataset**: This dataset contains information about 48,842 individuals, including features such as age, education, and race. The study aims to predict whether an individual's income exceeds $50K using a γ-EL fair logistic regression model.

After identifying these datasets, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. 

For the **Law School Admission Dataset**, the citation is:
> Wightman, L. F. (1998). LSAC National Longitudinal Bar Passage Study. LSAC Research Report Series.

For the **Adult Income Dataset**, the citation is:
> Kohavi, R. (1996). Scaling up the accuracy of naive-bayes classifiers: A decision-tree hybrid. In KDD, volume 96, pages 202–207.

Now that I have the dataset names and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and completeness. 

In summary, I have identified two datasets from the paper and retrieved their full citations, which are crucial for proper documentation and referencing in any subsequent work.
