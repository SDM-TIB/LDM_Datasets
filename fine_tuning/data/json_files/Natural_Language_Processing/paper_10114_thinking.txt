To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Introducing the Perturbative Solution of the Inter-Channel Stimulated Raman Scattering in Single-Mode Optical Fibers" by Andrea Dâ€™Amico et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a high-level overview, but I need to look for specific datasets in the body of the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Simulation Setup)**, where the authors describe the optical line system architecture and the parameters used in their simulations. This section is likely to contain details about any datasets or parameters that were utilized in their experiments.

In **section 4.1**, the authors mention the optical amplifier noise figure values used in the considered wideband scenario. This is important information, but it does not constitute a dataset in the traditional sense.

In **section 4.3 (Analysed Scenarios)**, the authors describe the different transmission scenarios they considered, including the C+L+S-band and U-to-E-band transmission scenarios. They mention the total transmission bandwidths and the fixed power per channel, which are relevant parameters but again do not represent datasets.

I will also check the **References section** to see if any datasets are cited or referenced. However, it appears that the paper primarily discusses theoretical models and simulations rather than empirical datasets.

After reviewing the paper, it seems that there are no explicit datasets provided in the traditional sense (like a collection of data points or a publicly available dataset). Instead, the authors focus on theoretical models and simulations based on existing parameters and values from the literature.

Since no datasets are explicitly mentioned, I will summarize the key parameters and findings from the paper instead of creating dataset entries. If any datasets were referenced, I would ensure to include full citations for each dataset as per the requirements.

In conclusion, I will compile the relevant parameters and findings into a structured format for clarity, but I will note that no traditional datasets were extracted from this paper.
