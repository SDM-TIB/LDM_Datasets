To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Beyond Worst-Case Attacks: Robust RL with Adaptive Defense via Non-Dominated Policies" by Xiangyu Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for empirical validation. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets in relation to the research objectives.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for testing their methods. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, characteristics, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

In this paper, the authors mention conducting empirical validation on **Mujoco environments**. I will note that Mujoco is a physics engine used for simulating robotic environments, and it may refer to specific datasets or benchmarks associated with these environments.

I will also check the **references section** for any citations related to the datasets. If the authors refer to specific datasets, they may provide full citations that I need to include in my documentation.

After identifying the datasets, I will ensure to write down the full citations for each dataset mentioned. For example, if they refer to a specific Mujoco environment, I will look for the original papers or documentation that describe these environments and provide their citations.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will include details such as the dataset name, its purpose, and any relevant characteristics that were highlighted in the paper.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets referenced in the paper, along with their proper citations.
