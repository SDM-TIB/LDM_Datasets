To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Low-Rank Extragradient Methods for Scalable Semidefinite Optimization" by Dan Garber and Atara Kaplan, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted numerical experiments with a dataset of Max-Cut instances, which indicates that a dataset is indeed present.

Next, I will look specifically in the **experiments section** to find detailed descriptions of the datasets used. In this paper, the authors refer to the **Gset dataset** for their experiments, which consists of graphs used for the Max-Cut problem. They mention that they used graphs G1 to G20 from this dataset, which provides a clear indication of the dataset's scope.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Gset dataset. The paper does not provide a direct citation for the dataset itself, but it is common for datasets to be referenced in their original publication or repository. I will look for any mention of the dataset's source or original authors in the text or references.

After reviewing the references, I find that the Gset dataset is associated with the University of Florida Sparse Matrix Collection. The citation for this dataset is as follows:
> The University of Florida Sparse Matrix Collection. *Gset group*. Available at: https://sparse.tamu.edu.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format. The dataset entry will include the name of the dataset, a description, and the full citation.

1. **Gset Dataset**: This dataset consists of graphs used for the Max-Cut problem, specifically graphs G1 to G20, which are part of the University of Florida Sparse Matrix Collection.

The full citation for the dataset is:
> The University of Florida Sparse Matrix Collection. *Gset group*. Available at: https://sparse.tamu.edu.

With this information, I can now prepare the dataset entry for further processing or review.
