To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CPPF: A Contextual and Post-Processing-Free Model for Automatic Speech Recognition" by Lei Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract discusses the integration of various ASR-related processing tasks but does not explicitly mention any datasets. However, the introduction provides context about the advancements in ASR systems and references several models and approaches, which may lead to dataset mentions later in the paper.

Next, I will examine **section 3 (Experiments)**, as this section typically contains details about the datasets used for training and evaluation. Here, the authors mention that they conducted experiments on the **Aishell-2 dataset**, which consists of 1,000 hours of Chinese spoken data sampled at a 16 kHz rate. This is a clear indication of a dataset being utilized in their research.

I will also look for any additional datasets mentioned in the **methodology** or **results** sections. However, the primary focus appears to be on the Aishell-2 dataset, as it is the only dataset explicitly referenced for the experiments conducted.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Aishell-2 dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Jiayu Du, Xingyu Na, Xuechen Liu, and Hui Bu. *Aishell-2: Transforming Mandarin ASR Research into Industrial Scale*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1808.10583, 2018.

Having identified the dataset and its citation, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and completeness.

In summary, the key steps I took include:
1. Reading the abstract and introduction for context.
2. Focusing on the experiments section to identify datasets.
3. Retrieving the full citation from the references.

Now, I will prepare the dataset entry based on the findings.
