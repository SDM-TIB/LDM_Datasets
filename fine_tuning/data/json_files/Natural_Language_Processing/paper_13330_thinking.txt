To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Hypergraph Convolutional Networks for Fine-grained ICU Patient Similarity Analysis and Risk Prediction" by Yuxi Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the use of the **eICU Collaborative Research Database** for evaluating the proposed method, which indicates that this is a key dataset for the study.

Next, I will look into **section 4.1 (Datasets, Tasks, and Evaluation Metrics)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the datasets used. Here, they specifically mention the **eICU Collaborative Research Database** and describe how they extracted 27,390 patients/samples from it for their experiments. This section will likely contain the necessary details about the dataset's structure and purpose.

In the **experiments section**, the authors discuss how they utilized the eICU database for predicting in-hospital mortality risk, confirming its significance in their research. I will also check if there are any additional datasets mentioned in the context of specific patient groups, such as those with Congestive Heart Failure (CHF) or Diabetes, as these may also be relevant.

Now, I will gather the full citation for the **eICU Collaborative Research Database** from the **References section**. The citation is as follows:
> Pollard, T.J., Johnson, A.E., Raffa, J.D., Celi, L.A., Mark, R.G., Badawi, O. "The eICU Collaborative Research Database, a freely available multi-center database for critical care research." *Scientific Data* 5(1), 1â€“13 (2018).

Since the paper primarily focuses on the eICU database, I will ensure to highlight this dataset in my final output. 

After collecting all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including the full citation, into a structured format for clarity and ease of use in future references or analyses.
