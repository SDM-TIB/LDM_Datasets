To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Co-occurrences using Fasttext embeddings for word similarity tasks in Urdu" by Usama Khalid et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, results, and conclusion sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors have built a corpus for Urdu and used it for word similarity tasks, which suggests that there are datasets involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention using a freely available Urdu news text corpus called COUNTER, which contains data from 1200 documents collected from various news agencies. This is a clear indication of a dataset that I need to document.

Next, I will look into the **methodology section**, where the authors describe the Urdu Monolingual corpus, which contains 54 million sentences, 90 million tokens, and 129K unique tokens. This is another dataset that needs to be included.

In the **results section**, the authors mention using two datasets for evaluating the similarity of learned word representations: **SimLex-999** and **WordSim-353**. Both of these datasets are crucial for the analysis presented in the paper.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset from the **References section**:

1. For the **COUNTER corpus**, the citation is:
   > Muhammad Sharjeel, Rao Muhammad Adeel Nawab, and Paul Rayson. *Counter: corpus of urdu news text reuse*. Language resources and evaluation, 51(3):777–803, 2017.

2. For the **SimLex-999 dataset**, the citation is:
   > Felix Hill, Roi Reichart, and Anna Korhonen. *Simlex-999: Evaluating semantic models with (genuine) similarity estimation*. Computational Linguistics, 41(4):665–695, 2015.

3. For the **WordSim-353 dataset**, the citation is:
   > Eneko Agirre, Enrique Alfonseca, Keith Hall, Jana Kravalova, Marius Pasca, and Aitor Soroa. *A study on similarity and relatedness using distributional and wordnet-based approaches*. 2009.

With these citations in hand, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
