To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Improving Execution Concurrency in Partial-Order Plans via Block-Substitution" by Sabah Binte Noor and Fazlul Hasan Siddiqui, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and it may mention specific datasets used for experiments or evaluations.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets or experiments**. In this paper, it appears that the authors discuss their experimental setup and the datasets used in the **Experimental Results and Discussion** section. I will focus on this section to find specific datasets.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention a dataset comprising **3265 plans from 811 problems across 31 distinct domains**. This dataset is crucial for understanding the performance of their proposed algorithm.

Now, I will extract the relevant details about the dataset:

1. **Dataset Name**: IPC Planning Dataset
   - **Description**: A dataset containing 3265 plans from 811 problems across 31 distinct domains, used to evaluate the performance of the CIBS algorithm.
   - **Citation**: The dataset is derived from the International Planning Competitions (IPC), but the paper does not provide a specific citation for the dataset itself. However, I can reference the IPC as follows:
     > International Planning Competition (IPC). Various years. Available at: [IPC website link].

Next, I will check the **References section** to see if there are any specific papers or sources that describe the dataset in detail. If there are, I will include those citations as well.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the IPC as the source of the dataset.

After completing these steps, I will have a clear and concise entry for the dataset used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
