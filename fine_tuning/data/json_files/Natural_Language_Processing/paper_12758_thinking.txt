To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ALE: A Simulation-Based Active Learning Evaluation Framework for the Parameter-Driven Comparison of Query Strategies for NLP" by Philipp Kohl et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the need for large amounts of labeled data in supervised machine learning and mentions a case study, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (ALE Framework)**, where the authors describe the framework's features and implementation. Here, they mention using specific datasets for their case study. I will look for explicit mentions of datasets and their characteristics.

In **section 7 (Case Study)**, the authors detail their experiments and explicitly name the datasets used:

1. **IMDb Reviews Corpus**: This dataset is used for binary sentiment classification and contains 50,000 documents, split into a training set of 25,000 and a test set of 25,000.

2. **TREC Dataset**: This dataset is used for multiclass question classification and contains 5,452 annotated questions for training and 500 for testing.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with sources for further exploration.

For the **IMDb Reviews Corpus**, the citation is:
> Maas, A.L., Daly, R.E., Pham, P.T., Huang, D., Ng, A.Y., Potts, C. (2011). *Learning Word Vectors for Sentiment Analysis*. In Proceedings of the 49th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, pages 142â€“150.

For the **TREC Dataset**, the citation is:
> Li, X., Roth, D. (2002). *Learning Question Classifiers*. In Proceedings of the 19th International Conference on Computational Linguistics (COLING).

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
