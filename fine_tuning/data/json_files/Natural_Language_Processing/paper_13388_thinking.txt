To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Revisiting Scalarization in Multi-Task Learning: A Theoretical Perspective" by Yuzheng Hu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract mentions that the authors performed experiments on a **real-world dataset**, which indicates that there is at least one dataset to look for.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section (Section 5)**, where the authors describe their experimental setup. They specifically mention using the **SARCOS dataset** for their experiments, which is a key dataset for their analysis.

In the experiments section, the authors provide details about the SARCOS dataset, stating that it consists of the configurations (position, velocity, acceleration) of robotic arms and the problem is to predict the torque of the respective arms. This gives me a clear understanding of the dataset's context and usage.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the SARCOS dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:

- For the **SARCOS dataset**, the citation is:
  > Vijayakumar, S., & Schaal, S. (2000). Locally weighted projection regression: An O(n) algorithm for incremental real-time learning in high-dimensional space. In Proceedings of the Seventeenth International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2000), volume 1, pages 288â€“293. Morgan Kaufmann.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the dataset details and the citation in a structured manner, ensuring that I have accurately captured the essence of the dataset as described in the paper.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that is ready for review or further processing.
