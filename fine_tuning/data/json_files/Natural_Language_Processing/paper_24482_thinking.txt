To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Less can be more: representational vs. stereotypical gender bias in facial expression recognition" by Iris Dominguez-Catena et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors use **AffectNet**, a large dataset for facial expression recognition, as a baseline for their experiments. This is a strong indication that this dataset is central to their research.

Next, I will look for specific sections that detail the datasets used. In the **methodology section (Section 3)**, the authors explicitly mention using **AffectNet** as their primary dataset. They describe its characteristics, including the number of images and the demographic diversity it aims to capture. This section will provide essential details about how the dataset is utilized in their experiments.

I will also check the **results section** to see if any additional datasets are mentioned or if there are any derived datasets created from AffectNet for their experiments. The authors discuss generating biased subsets from AffectNet, but they do not introduce any new datasets outside of AffectNet itself.

Now, I will compile the full citation for **AffectNet** from the references section. The citation is as follows:
> Ali Mollahosseini, Behzad Hasani, and Mohammad H. Mahoor. *AffectNet: A Database for Facial Expression, Valence, and Arousal Computing in the Wild*. IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing, 10(1):18â€“31, January 2019.

Since AffectNet is the only dataset explicitly mentioned and used in the paper, I will summarize my findings:

1. **AffectNet**: This dataset is used as the baseline for the experiments, and the authors create biased subsets from it to analyze gender bias in facial expression recognition.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for AffectNet, ensuring that I include the full citation as required. This structured approach ensures that I capture all relevant information accurately and comprehensively.
