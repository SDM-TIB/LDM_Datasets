To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Short-Term Solar Irradiance Forecasting under Data Transmission Constraints" by Joshua E. Hammond et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract mentions the use of "five years of data from the NREL Solar Radiation Research Laboratory," which indicates that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will look for specific sections that detail the datasets used, such as **section 3 (Model)** and **section 6 (Data Availability)**. In section 3, the authors describe the data used for training their model, specifically mentioning the **Baseline Measurement System (BMS)** from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). This is a key dataset that I need to document.

In section 6, the authors provide a reference to the data source, which is crucial for citation purposes. They mention that the data were provided by the NREL Solar Radiation Research Laboratory (SRRL) and include a specific citation for this dataset.

Now, I will compile the information I have gathered about the datasets:

1. **NREL Solar Radiation Research Laboratory (SRRL) Baseline Measurement System (BMS)**: This dataset includes various meteorological measurements and is used for training the machine learning model. It provides 131 parameters, including scalar data extracted from a sky camera.

Next, I will retrieve the full citation for the NREL SRRL BMS dataset from the references section:

- For the **NREL SRRL BMS**, the citation is:
  > T. Stoffel, A. Andreas, NREL Solar Radiation Research Laboratory (SRRL): Baseline Measurement System (BMS); Golden, Colorado (data), Tech. rep., National Renewable Energy Lab. (NREL), Golden, CO (United States) (1981). doi:10.5439/1052221.

After gathering this information, I will ensure that I have accurately documented the dataset and its citation. This will allow me to create a structured output that includes the dataset name, description, and full citation, ready for further processing or review.
