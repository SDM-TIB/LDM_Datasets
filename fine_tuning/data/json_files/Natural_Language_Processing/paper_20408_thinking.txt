To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Pencil: Private and Extensible Collaborative Learning without the Non-Colluding Assumption" by Xuanqi Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and evaluation sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for evaluation. The introduction often discusses the context and relevance of the datasets in relation to the research problem.

Next, I will specifically look for a **dedicated section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments or evaluation sections**. In this paper, the authors describe their experiments and the datasets they used for training and testing their models.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention using the following datasets:

1. **MNIST Dataset**: This dataset consists of 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits (60,000 for training and 10,000 for testing). It is commonly used for training various image processing systems.

2. **CIFAR10 Dataset**: This dataset includes 60,000 RGB images (50,000 for training and 10,000 for testing) across 10 different categories. It is widely used for benchmarking machine learning algorithms.

3. **AGNews Dataset**: This dataset contains 120,000 training and 7,600 testing lines of news text categorized into four different topics. It is often used for text classification tasks.

Now, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

- For the **MNIST Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998. [Online]. Available: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

- For the **CIFAR10 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009. [Online]. Available: https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html

- For the **AGNews Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Zhang, Y., Zhao, J., Saleh, M., & Liu, P. J. (2015). *Character-level Convolutional Networks for Text Classification*. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS). [Online]. Available: https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.01626

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture the datasets used in the research and provide proper references for future use.
