To extract datasets from the research paper titled "From Manifestations to Cognitive Architectures: a Scalable Framework" by Alfredo Ibias et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a high-level overview, but I need to look for specific mentions of datasets in the body of the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors discuss their approach and the context of their research. I will look for any references to datasets that may have been used to validate their framework or any datasets that are foundational to their work.

I will then examine the **methodology section** for any explicit mentions of datasets used in their experiments or analyses. This section often contains detailed descriptions of the data sources, including any datasets that were collected or utilized in their computational framework.

After identifying potential datasets, I will check the **results and discussion sections** to see if the authors refer to specific datasets when discussing their findings. This will help confirm the datasets' relevance and usage in their research.

Finally, I will consult the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets themselves.

In this paper, I anticipate that the authors might reference well-known datasets related to cognitive architectures or machine learning, such as the MNIST dataset, which is commonly used in computational neuroscience and AI research.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as they appear in the references section of the paper. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research and their significance in the context of the study.
