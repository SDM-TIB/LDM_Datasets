To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Spectral Perspective towards Understanding and Improving Adversarial Robustness" by Binxiao Huang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that experiments were conducted across multiple datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section VI (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they state that they selected three common image datasets: 

1. **CIFAR-10**: This dataset is widely used for image classification tasks and consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class.

2. **CIFAR-100**: Similar to CIFAR-10, this dataset contains 60,000 images but is divided into 100 classes, with 600 images per class.

3. **Tiny ImageNet**: This dataset is a smaller version of the ImageNet dataset, containing 100,000 images of 64x64 pixels across 200 classes.

In the same section, the authors provide details about the experimental setup, including data augmentation methods and the resolution of images, which further confirms the datasets being used.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **CIFAR-10** and **CIFAR-100**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009.

- For **Tiny ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Y. Le, X. Yang. *Tiny ImageNet Visual Recognition Challenge*. CS231N, 2015.

Having gathered this information, I will now compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This structured approach ensures that I accurately capture the datasets used in the research and their respective citations.
