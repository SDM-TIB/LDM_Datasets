To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On the Impact of Sampling on Deep Sequential State Estimation" by Helena Calatrava et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study and may mention any datasets used. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets in relation to the research objectives.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this paper, the authors mention two experiments: one involving polyphonic music data and another involving the 3-space Lorenz attractor model. I will look for specific details about these datasets, such as their characteristics, sizes, and any relevant splits (e.g., training, validation, testing).

In the **first experiment**, the authors describe using a polyphonic music dataset consisting of sequences with a maximum length of 129, 144, and 160 polyphonic samples for training, validation, and testing, respectively. However, they do not provide a specific citation for this dataset, which is crucial for proper attribution.

In the **second experiment**, they utilize the 3-space Lorenz attractor model, which is a well-known chaotic system. The authors reference the original work on the Lorenz attractor, which is essential for citation purposes.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. For the **polyphonic music dataset**, while the paper does not provide a specific citation, I will note that it is important to find the original source or dataset repository for proper attribution. If the dataset is commonly known or publicly available, I will include that information.

2. For the **3-space Lorenz attractor**, the citation is:
   > E. N. Lorenz, “Deterministic nonperiodic flow,” Journal of the Atmospheric Sciences, vol. 20, no. 2, pp. 130–141, 1963.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited. This will involve summarizing the key characteristics of each dataset and ensuring that the citations are formatted correctly for inclusion in any subsequent structured output or documentation.
