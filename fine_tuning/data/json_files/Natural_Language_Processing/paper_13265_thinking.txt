To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Critical Learning Periods Emerge Even in Deep Linear Networks" by Michael Kleinman et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study and may mention specific datasets used for experiments. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the research, which might include references to datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **experiments**. In this paper, it appears that the authors discuss their experimental setup in detail, which is likely to include the datasets they utilized. I will pay close attention to any specific names or descriptions of datasets mentioned in these sections.

As I read through the relevant sections, I will note down any datasets mentioned. For instance, if the authors refer to a dataset used for training or testing their models, I will record its name, purpose, and any relevant details provided.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial, as proper attribution is necessary for academic integrity. I will look for the original papers or sources from which the datasets were derived.

For example, if the authors mention using a dataset like the "Penn Action Dataset," I will locate its citation in the references. I will ensure to note the authors, title, conference or journal name, and publication year.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, including their names and full citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference.

In summary, my step-by-step approach will be:
1. Read the **abstract** and **introduction** for initial mentions of datasets.
2. Identify and analyze the **datasets section** or **experiments section** for detailed descriptions.
3. Record the names and details of each dataset mentioned.
4. Consult the **References section** for full citations of each dataset.
5. Compile the dataset information for clarity and accuracy.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I extract all relevant datasets from the paper along with their proper citations.
