To extract datasets from the research paper titled "YOSM: A New Yor`ub´a Sentiment Corpus for Movie Reviews" by Iyanuoluwa Shode et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The introduction highlights the lack of sentiment analysis resources for African languages, specifically mentioning the creation of a new dataset for Yor`ub´a movie reviews, which indicates that a dataset is indeed present.

Next, I will focus on the **Data section**, where the authors describe their dataset in detail. They mention that they collected **1,500 reviews** from various sources, including IMDB, Rotten Tomatoes, Letterboxd, Cinemapointer, and Nollyrated. This section provides crucial information about the dataset's composition and the sources from which the data was gathered.

In the **Results section**, the authors discuss the performance of their models on the YOSM dataset, confirming its use in their experiments. This reinforces the importance of the dataset in their research.

Now, I will compile the necessary details about the dataset:

1. **YOSM Dataset**: This dataset consists of 1,500 Yor`ub´a movie reviews, which were manually translated from English reviews. The reviews are balanced between positive and negative sentiments, with a clear classification based on ratings. The dataset is publicly available on GitHub.

Next, I will look for the full citation of the YOSM dataset in the **References section**. The authors do not provide a separate citation for the dataset itself, but they do mention that it is publicly available on GitHub. Therefore, I will use the GitHub link as the citation for the dataset.

The citation for the YOSM dataset is:
> Iyanuoluwa Shode, David Ifeoluwa Adelani, and Anna Feldman. *YOSM: A New Yor`ub´a Sentiment Corpus for Movie Reviews*. Available at: https://github.com/IyanuSh/YOSM.

Finally, I will summarize the dataset information and prepare it for structured output, ensuring that I include the full citation as required. This will allow for easy reference and further use in related research or applications.
