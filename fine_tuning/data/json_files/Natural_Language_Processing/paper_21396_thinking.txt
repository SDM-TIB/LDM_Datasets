To extract datasets from the research paper titled "V-MAD: Video-based Morphing Attack Detection in Operational Scenarios" by Guido Borghi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their full citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental evaluation sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the paper discusses a new database collected for the V-MAD task, which suggests that there are specific datasets involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental evaluation section (Section 4)**, particularly **subsection 4.1 (Database and evaluation protocol)**, where the authors describe the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention the following datasets:

1. **Bona fide document images**: This dataset consists of 205 images acquired under controlled conditions, suitable for passport applications.

2. **Gate images**: A total of 612 images were collected from real Automated Border Control (ABC) gates, representing live captures of subjects.

3. **Morphed document images**: This dataset includes 1142 morphed images created using 12 different morphing algorithms, which were generated from the bona fide document images.

The authors also provide details on how these datasets were used in their experiments, confirming their relevance to the study.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. However, since the datasets are newly collected and not previously published, they may not have formal citations like established datasets. Instead, I will note the details provided in the paper itself.

The relevant information for the datasets is as follows:

- **Bona fide document images**: 205 images collected for the study.
- **Gate images**: 612 images collected from real ABC gates.
- **Morphed document images**: 1142 images created using various morphing algorithms.

Since these datasets are described in the paper but do not have formal citations, I will summarize their details as they are presented in the text.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that captures the essential information, ensuring that I include the context and details provided by the authors. This will allow for a comprehensive understanding of the datasets used in the study.
