To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Optimal Sample Lens Positioning in Digital Camera Systems" by Ali Karaoglu, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly referenced. The abstract discusses the optimization of lens positions but does not mention specific datasets. The introduction elaborates on autofocus systems but again does not provide any dataset names.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (section 3.3) where the author describes a simple experiment using the proposed method. Here, the author mentions initial parameters for the experiment, including focal length, aperture, and Circle of Confusion, but does not refer to any external datasets. Instead, the results are presented in a table (Table 1) that lists calculated sample lens positions based on the parameters provided.

Since the paper does not reference any external datasets or publicly available datasets, I will check the **references section** to see if any cited works include datasets. However, the references primarily consist of papers discussing autofocus algorithms and techniques, rather than datasets themselves.

After reviewing the entire paper, it appears that there are no datasets explicitly mentioned or utilized from external sources. The calculations and results presented are based on theoretical models and parameters defined by the author rather than empirical data from a dataset.

In conclusion, since no datasets are identified in the paper, I will not be able to provide any citations for datasets. Instead, I will note that the paper focuses on theoretical calculations and methods for lens positioning in digital camera systems without referencing any external datasets.
