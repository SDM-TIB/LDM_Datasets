To extract datasets from the research paper titled "UNITER: UNiversal Image-TExt Representation Learning" by Yen-Chun Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. In the abstract, the authors refer to "four image-text datasets (COCO, Visual Genome, Conceptual Captions, and SBU Captions)" used for pre-training. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for the research.

Next, I will examine **section 3.3 (Pre-training Datasets)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the datasets used for pre-training. Here, they explicitly list:

1. **COCO**: A well-known dataset for image captioning and object detection.
2. **Visual Genome (VG)**: A dataset that provides dense annotations of images.
3. **Conceptual Captions (CC)**: A dataset for automatic image captioning.
4. **SBU Captions**: Another dataset for image captioning.

The authors also mention that these datasets are used to create a large-scale V+L dataset for training their model.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **COCO**, the citation is:
  > Lin, T.Y., Maire, M., Belongie, S., Hays, J., Perona, P., Ramanan, D., DollÃ¡r, P., & Zitnick, C.L. (2014). *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. In Proceedings of the European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), 2014.

- For **Visual Genome**, the citation is:
  > Krishna, R., Zhu, Y., Groth, O., Johnson, J., Hata, K., Kravitz, J., Chen, S., Kalantidis, Y., Li, L.J., & Shamma, D.A. (2017). *Visual Genome: Connecting Language and Vision Using Crowdsourced Dense Image Annotations*. International Journal of Computer Vision (IJCV), 2017.

- For **Conceptual Captions**, the citation is:
  > Sharma, P., Ding, N., Goodman, S., & Soricut, R. (2018). *Conceptual Captions: A Cleaned, Hypernymed, Image Alt-Text Dataset for Automatic Image Captioning*. In Proceedings of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL), 2018.

- For **SBU Captions**, the citation is:
  > Ordonez, V., Kulkarni, G., & Berg, T. (2011). *Im2Text: Describing Images Using 1 Million Captioned Photographs*. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS), 2011.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or processing. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets relevant to the research and their proper citations.
