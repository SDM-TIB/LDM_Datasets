To extract datasets from the research paper titled "I-AI: A Controllable & Interpretable AI System for Decoding Radiologistsâ€™ Intense Focus for Accurate CXR Diagnoses" by Trong Thang Pham et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors utilize an eye gaze dataset to extract anatomical gaze information, which suggests that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any specific mentions of datasets. The authors reference the REFLACX dataset, which contains eye gaze data for chest X-rays (CXR). This is a crucial dataset for their proposed method.

In the **methodology section**, particularly in section 4.1, the authors provide more details about the REFLACX dataset, stating that it includes eye gaze data for over 2,500 CXRs from the MIMIC-CXR database. This section confirms the dataset's relevance and usage in their experiments.

I will also check the **experiments section** to see if the authors mention any additional datasets or provide further context on how the REFLACX dataset is utilized. They discuss the process of creating ground truth heatmaps from the gaze data, reinforcing the importance of the REFLACX dataset in their methodology.

Finally, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citation for the REFLACX dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:
> Ricardo Bigolin Lanfredi, Mingyuan Zhang, et al. *REFLACX: Reports and eye-tracking data for localization of abnormalities in chest x-rays*. 2021.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use.

In summary, the key dataset extracted from the paper is:
1. **REFLACX Dataset**: Contains eye gaze data for over 2,500 CXRs, which is crucial for the proposed I-AI model.

The full citation for the dataset is:
> Ricardo Bigolin Lanfredi, Mingyuan Zhang, et al. *REFLACX: Reports and eye-tracking data for localization of abnormalities in chest x-rays*. 2021.

This structured approach ensures that I have accurately captured the relevant datasets and their citations from the research paper.
