To extract datasets from the research paper titled "VQ-HPS: Human Pose and Shape Estimation in a Vector-Quantized Latent Space" by Guénolé Fiche et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and method sections** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of human pose and shape estimation and mention the need for datasets with RGB images paired with 3D meshes. This indicates that datasets are crucial for their research, but I need to find specific names.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Results)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for training and evaluation:

1. **AMASS Dataset**: The authors state that the Mesh-VQ-VAE is trained on the AMASS dataset, which contains over 11,000 motions and 300 subjects in the SMPL format. This dataset is significant for its variety of body poses and shapes.

2. **3DPW Dataset**: The paper mentions that the 3DPW dataset consists of 60 in-the-wild RGB videos with 3D ground truth for human bodies. This dataset is used for training, validation, and testing.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **AMASS dataset**, the citation is:
  > N. Mahmood, N. Ghorbani, N. F. Troje, G. Pons-Moll, and M. J. Black. *AMASS: Archive of Motion Capture as Surface Shapes*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 5442–5451, 2019.

- For the **3DPW dataset**, the citation is:
  > T. von Marcard, R. Henschel, M. Black, B. Rosenhahn, and G. Pons-Moll. *Recovering Accurate 3D Human Pose in the Wild Using IMUs and a Moving Camera*. In Proceedings of the European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), pages 601–617, 2018.

Having gathered the dataset names and their citations, I will now prepare to compile this information into a structured format for further use or analysis. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their significance in the context of the research presented in the paper.
