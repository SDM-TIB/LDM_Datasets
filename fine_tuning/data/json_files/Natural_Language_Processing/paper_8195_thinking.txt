To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Transcending Scaling Laws with 0.1% Extra Compute" by Yi Tay et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the introduction of a new set of models called U-PaLM, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. The introduction discusses scaling laws and the performance of U-PaLM but again does not provide specific dataset names.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (section 4) closely, as this is where datasets are typically detailed. In this section, the authors describe various experiments conducted with U-PaLM, including evaluations on several benchmarks. I will look for any references to datasets used for these evaluations.

Upon reviewing section 4, I find that the authors mention several benchmarks and tasks, but they do not provide explicit dataset names in the main text. However, they do refer to specific tasks and benchmarks that can be traced back to datasets. For example, they mention "BIG-Bench tasks," "MMLU," "TydiQA," and "GSM8K." I will need to look up these benchmarks to identify the datasets they correspond to.

Next, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets associated with the mentioned benchmarks. I will look for the original papers or sources that introduced these datasets.

1. **BIG-Bench**: This benchmark is a collection of tasks designed to evaluate the capabilities of large language models. The reference for this benchmark is:
   > Wei, J., et al. (2022). *Emergent abilities of large language models*. Transactions on Machine Learning Research.

2. **MMLU (Massively Multi-Task Language Understanding)**: This benchmark is detailed in the following citation:
   > Hendrycks, D., et al. (2020). *Measuring massive multitask language understanding*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2009.03300.

3. **TydiQA**: This dataset is referenced as follows:
   > Clark, J. H., et al. (2020). *Tydi QA: A benchmark for information-seeking question answering in typologically diverse languages*. Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics, 8, 454-470.

4. **GSM8K**: This dataset is cited in the following paper:
   > Cobbe, K., et al. (2021). *Training verifiers to solve math word problems*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2110.14168.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their corresponding citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity.

In summary, I will document the following datasets along with their full citations:

- **BIG-Bench**: 
  > Wei, J., et al. (2022). *Emergent abilities of large language models*. Transactions on Machine Learning Research.

- **MMLU**: 
  > Hendrycks, D., et al. (2020). *Measuring massive multitask language understanding*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2009.03300.

- **TydiQA**: 
  > Clark, J. H., et al. (2020). *Tydi QA: A benchmark for information-seeking question answering in typologically diverse languages*. Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics, 8, 454-470.

- **GSM8K**: 
  > Cobbe, K., et al. (2021). *Training verifiers to solve math word problems*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2110.14168.

With this information, I will be ready to present the dataset entries in the required format for further processing or review.
