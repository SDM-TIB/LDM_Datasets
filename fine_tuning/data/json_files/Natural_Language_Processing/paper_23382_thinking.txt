To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Multi-Scale Direction-Aware Network for Infrared Small Target Detection" by Jinmiao Zhao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. In the abstract, the authors mention achieving state-of-the-art results on three public datasets: **NUDT-SIRST, SIRST, and IRSTD-1k**. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for the research and should be examined further.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used. In this section, they explicitly list the three datasets:

1. **NUDT-SIRST**: This is described as a synthetic dataset with five main background scenes: city, field, highlight, ocean, and cloud. The authors mention that approximately 37% of the images contain at least two objects, and they adopt two division rules for training and testing.

2. **SIRST**: This dataset is characterized as a real dataset containing 427 infrared images from various scenes. The authors note that about 10% of the images contain multiple objects, and they also specify two division rules for this dataset.

3. **IRSTD-1k**: This dataset consists of 1000 infrared images, each resized to 512Ã—512 pixels. It includes small targets of different types and locations, such as drones and vehicles, across various scenes.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to guide readers to the original sources.

The citations I will extract are:

- For **NUDT-SIRST**:
  > Zhao, J., Shi, Z., Yu, C., Liu, Y., & Zhang, Y. (2023). Multi-Scale Direction-Aware Network for Infrared Small Target Detection. *IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing*.

- For **SIRST**:
  > Zhao, J., Shi, Z., Yu, C., Liu, Y., & Zhang, Y. (2023). Multi-Scale Direction-Aware Network for Infrared Small Target Detection. *IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing*.

- For **IRSTD-1k**:
  > Zhao, J., Shi, Z., Yu, C., Liu, Y., & Zhang, Y. (2023). Multi-Scale Direction-Aware Network for Infrared Small Target Detection. *IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing*.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will allow for a clear and organized presentation of the datasets used in the research.
