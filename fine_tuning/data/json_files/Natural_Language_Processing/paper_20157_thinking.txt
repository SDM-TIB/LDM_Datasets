To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Post-Training Attribute Unlearning in Recommender Systems" by Chaochao Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction typically outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of attribute unlearning in recommender systems, but I need to look for specific datasets. The **experiments section** is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets used for evaluation.

Upon reaching **section 5.1.1 (Datasets)**, the authors explicitly list four datasets used in their experiments:

1. **MovieLens 100K (ML-100K)**: This dataset contains 100,000 ratings from users towards movies, along with attributes such as gender and age.
   
2. **MovieLens 1M (ML-1M)**: A larger version of the MovieLens dataset with 1 million ratings, also including user attributes like gender and age.

3. **LFM-2B**: This dataset includes over 2 billion listening events for music retrieval and recommendation tasks, containing user attributes such as gender and country.

4. **KuaiSAR-small**: A unified search and recommendation dataset with genuine user behavior logs from a short-video mobile app, including user attributes Feat1 and Feat2.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For the **MovieLens datasets**, the citations are typically as follows:
- For **MovieLens 100K**:
  > F. Maxwell Harper and Joseph A. Konstan. *The MovieLens Datasets: History and Context*. ACM Transactions on Interactive Intelligent Systems (TIIS), 5(4), 2015.

- For **MovieLens 1M**:
  > F. Maxwell Harper and Joseph A. Konstan. *The MovieLens Datasets: History and Context*. ACM Transactions on Interactive Intelligent Systems (TIIS), 5(4), 2015.

For **LFM-2B**, the citation is:
- > A. B. Melchiorre et al. *Investigating Gender Fairness of Recommendation Algorithms in the Music Domain*. Information Processing & Management, 58(5), 2021.

For **KuaiSAR-small**, the citation is:
- > KuaiSAR. *A Unified Search and Recommendation Dataset*. Available at: https://kuaisar.github.io/.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and future reference. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their respective citations.
