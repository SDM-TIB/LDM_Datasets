To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Effective Abnormal Activity Detection on Multivariate Time Series Healthcare Data" by Yuchen Zhao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and evaluation sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the evaluation of the proposed method on a real-world gait dataset, which indicates that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors discuss the importance of identifying abnormal activities in healthcare and the challenges associated with multivariate time series data. However, I need to find specific dataset names.

In the **evaluation section**, the authors explicitly mention the **Daphnet dataset** as the dataset used for their experiments. They describe it as being collected from ten patients with Parkinsonâ€™s disease who wore 3D-acceleration sensors while performing daily activities, which is crucial information for understanding the dataset's context.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the Daphnet dataset. The citation provided in the references is:

- **Daphnet dataset**: 
  > D Roggen, M Plotnik, and J Hausdorff. 2013. UCI Machine Learning Repository: Daphnet Freezing of Gait Data Set. School of Information and Computer Science, University of California: Irvine, CA, USA (2013).

Since this is the only dataset mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information about the Daphnet dataset, including its description and citation.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry, ensuring that I include the full citation as required. This will allow for proper referencing and acknowledgment of the dataset used in the research.
