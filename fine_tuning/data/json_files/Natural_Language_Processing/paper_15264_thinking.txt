To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MeaeQ: Mount Model Extraction Attacks with Efficient Queries" by Chengwei Dai et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that extensive experiments were conducted on four benchmark datasets, which indicates that specific datasets are used.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. They mention four datasets:

1. **Hate Speech Dataset**: This dataset is referenced as being from de Gibert et al. (2018), which focuses on detecting hate speech.
2. **SST-2 Dataset**: This dataset is from Socher et al. (2013) and is used for sentiment analysis.
3. **IMDB Dataset**: This dataset is from Maas et al. (2011) and is also used for sentiment classification.
4. **AG News Dataset**: This dataset is from Zhang et al. (2015) and is used for topic classification.

In the **appendix**, the authors provide additional details about the datasets, including their sizes and splits, which I will also note for completeness.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset from the references section:

- For the **Hate Speech Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Ona de Gibert, Naiara Perez, Aitor García-Pablos, and Montse Cuadros. *Hate speech dataset from a white supremacy forum*. In Proceedings of the 2nd Workshop on Abusive Language Online (ALW2), pages 11–20, Brussels, Belgium, 2018. Association for Computational Linguistics.

- For the **SST-2 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Andrew L. Maas, Raymond E. Daly, Peter T. Pham, Dan Huang, Andrew Y. Ng, and Christopher Potts. *Learning word vectors for sentiment analysis*. In Proceedings of the 49th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, pages 142–150, Portland, Oregon, USA, 2011. Association for Computational Linguistics.

- For the **IMDB Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Andrew L. Maas, Raymond E. Daly, Peter T. Pham, Dan Huang, Andrew Y. Ng, and Christopher Potts. *Learning word vectors for sentiment analysis*. In Proceedings of the 49th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, pages 142–150, Portland, Oregon, USA, 2011. Association for Computational Linguistics.

- For the **AG News Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Xiang Zhang, Junbo Jake Zhao, and Yann LeCun. *Character-level convolutional networks for text classification*. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 28: Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems 2015, pages 649–657, Montreal, Quebec, Canada, 2015.

After compiling this information, I will ensure that each dataset is clearly documented with its respective citation, ready for further processing or review.
