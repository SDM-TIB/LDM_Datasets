To extract datasets from the research paper titled "No Bidding, No Regret: Pairwise-Feedback Mechanisms for Digital Goods and Data Auctions" by Zachary Robertson and Oluwasanmi Koyejo, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions "experimental results on multi-label toxicity annotation data," which suggests that there is a dataset involved.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this section, the authors describe their experiments using "multi-label data from the Toxic Comment Classification Challenge on Kaggle." This indicates that the dataset used for their experiments is the Toxic Comment Classification Challenge dataset.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citation for this dataset. The authors reference the dataset as follows:

- For the **Toxic Comment Classification Challenge dataset**, the citation is:
  > Jigsaw. *Toxic Comment Classification Challenge*. 2018. URL https://tinyurl.com/jigsaw-toxic-comment-challenge.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the findings:

1. **Toxic Comment Classification Challenge Dataset**: This dataset contains a large number of Wikipedia comments labeled by human raters for toxic behavior, including categories such as toxic, severe-toxic, obscene, threat, insult, and identity-hate.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use, ensuring that the full citation is included for each dataset extracted from the paper.
