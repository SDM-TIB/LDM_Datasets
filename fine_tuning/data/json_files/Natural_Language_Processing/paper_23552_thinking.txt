To extract datasets from the research paper titled "LaLonde (1986) after Nearly Four Decades: Lessons Learned" by Guido Imbens and Yiqing Xu, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract references the **LaLonde data** and the **Imbens-Rubin-Sacerdote (IRS) lottery data**, indicating that these are key datasets for the analysis.

Next, I will look for specific sections that detail the datasets used, such as **Section 1 (Introduction)** and **Section 2 (LaLonde’s Findings)**. In these sections, the authors discuss the **LaLonde-Dehejia-Wahba (LDW) data** and the **Lalonde-Calónico-Smith (LCS) data**. 

In **Section 2.3**, the authors describe the **LDW data** as a subset of the original LaLonde data, which includes male participants with available earnings and unemployment status from 1974. They also mention that the **LCS data** is a reconstruction of female samples used in the original LaLonde study.

I will also check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets:

1. **LaLonde Data**:
   - Citation: 
     > LaLonde, R. (1986). Evaluating the econometric evaluations of training programs with experimental data. *The American Economic Review*, 76(4), 604-620.

2. **LaLonde-Dehejia-Wahba (LDW) Data**:
   - Citation:
     > Dehejia, R. H., & Wahba, S. (1999). Causal effects in nonexperimental studies: Reevaluating the evaluation of training programs. *Journal of the American Statistical Association*, 94(448), 1053-1062.

3. **Lalonde-Calónico-Smith (LCS) Data**:
   - Citation:
     > Calónico, S., & Smith, J. (2017). The women of the national supported work demonstration. *Journal of Labor Economics*, 35(S1), S65-S97.

4. **Imbens-Rubin-Sacerdote (IRS) Lottery Data**:
   - Citation:
     > Imbens, G. W., Rubin, D. B., & Sacerdote, B. I. (2001). Estimating the effect of unearned income on labor earnings, savings, and consumption: Evidence from a survey of lottery players. *American Economic Review*, 91(4), 778-794.

After identifying these datasets and their citations, I will summarize the key characteristics of each dataset, such as the number of observations, the variables included, and the context in which they were used in the analysis.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly presents each dataset along with its citation, ensuring that the extraction is thorough and accurate for future reference or analysis.
