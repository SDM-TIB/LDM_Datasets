To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Super resolution of histopathological frozen sections via deep learning preserving tissue structure" by Elad Yoshai et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on super-resolution techniques for histopathological images, which suggests that datasets related to histopathology are likely involved.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, specifically the subsection titled **Data collection and preprocessing**. Here, the authors describe the data used for training their models. They mention that the data consists of frozen-section pathology slides of kidney cancers obtained from **The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)**. This indicates that TCGA is a primary dataset used in their research.

The authors specify that they downloaded whole-slide images in SVS format and pre-processed them into overlapping patches of 256x256 pixels. They report obtaining a total of **45,050 training patches** and **2,651 testing patches**. This detailed description confirms the dataset's nature and its application in their experiments.

Additionally, they mention preparing two datasets with different downsampling factors: one with a downsample of **x4** and another with **x8**. This information is crucial as it indicates variations of the dataset used for different experimental setups.

Now, I will look for the **full citation** for the TCGA dataset in the **references section**. The TCGA is a well-known resource, and while it may not have a specific citation in the same format as other papers, I can reference it as follows:

- **The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)**: The Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network. *Comprehensive genomic characterization defines human glioblastoma genes and core pathways*. Nature 455, 1061â€“1068 (2008). [Link: https://www.cancer.gov/tcga]

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets identified:

1. **TCGA Kidney Cancer Dataset**: Contains frozen-section pathology slides of kidney cancers, pre-processed into 45,050 training patches and 2,651 testing patches, with downsampling factors of x4 and x8.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and ensure that the full citation for the TCGA dataset is included. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
