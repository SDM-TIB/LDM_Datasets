To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On Learning Spatial Sequences with the Movement of Attention" by V.M. Osaulenko, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections for any references to datasets. The abstract discusses the representation of spatial sequences and mentions a thought experiment involving the recognition of movements over skin, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets.

Next, I will look through the **main body of the paper**, particularly focusing on sections that might discuss experiments or methodologies that could involve datasets. I will pay special attention to any figures, tables, or references that might indicate the use of specific datasets.

In the **thought experiment section**, the author describes a scenario involving a black dot moving in patterns and how humans recognize these movements. However, there are no datasets mentioned here either.

Continuing through the paper, I will check the **background** and **spatial sequence representations** sections for any references to datasets used in previous studies or experiments. The author discusses various concepts related to sequence learning but does not provide specific datasets.

Finally, I will review the **conclusion** and **references** sections. The references may contain citations to studies that utilized datasets, but the paper itself does not seem to present any original datasets.

After thoroughly reviewing the paper, it appears that there are no specific datasets mentioned or utilized in the research. Therefore, I will note that no datasets were extracted from this paper.

In summary, I will document my findings as follows:

- No datasets were explicitly mentioned or utilized in the paper "On Learning Spatial Sequences with the Movement of Attention" by V.M. Osaulenko.

This process highlights the importance of carefully reading through each section of a research paper to identify any datasets, even if they are not immediately obvious in the abstract or introduction.
