To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Attacks against Ranking Algorithms with Text Embeddings: a Case Study on Recruitment Algorithms" by Anahita Samadi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on recruitment algorithms and mentions the use of real public applicant resumes and job descriptions, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will examine **section 4 (Data Collection)**, where the authors detail their data sources. Here, they mention collecting **100 real public applicant resumes** from LinkedIn, GitHub, and personal websites, specifically targeting resumes related to computer science. This indicates a dataset of resumes.

Additionally, they describe the collection of **over 10,000 job descriptions** from the Indeed website, which is another dataset relevant to their experiments. They also mention augmenting their data by creating **5,000 records** by concatenating resumes with job descriptions, and another dataset of **10,000 resumes** created through a specific combination method.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper does not provide formal citations for the datasets themselves, as they are derived from publicly available sources. However, I can summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **Applicant Resumes Dataset**: This dataset consists of 100 real public applicant resumes collected from LinkedIn, GitHub, and personal websites, focusing on candidates in computer science.

2. **Job Descriptions Dataset**: This dataset includes over 10,000 job descriptions extracted from the Indeed website, with 50 job descriptions randomly selected for experiments.

3. **Augmented Dataset**: This dataset is created by concatenating the 100 resumes with the 50 job descriptions, resulting in 5,000 records for training purposes.

4. **Combined Resumes Dataset**: This dataset consists of 10,000 resumes generated by splitting and recombining existing resumes to maintain structure while varying content.

Since the datasets are derived from publicly available sources, I will note that specific citations for these datasets may not be applicable, but I will reference the sources from which they were derived.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that clearly identifies each dataset, its description, and the source of the data. This will ensure that the datasets are well-documented and ready for further processing or review.
