To extract datasets from the research paper titled "AGENTBOARD: An Analytical Evaluation of Multi-Turn LLM Agents" by Chang Ma et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract introduces AGENTBOARD as a benchmark and evaluation framework, which suggests that it may reference specific datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (AGENTBOARD – Overview)**, where the authors describe the framework and its components. Here, they mention that AGENTBOARD encompasses a diverse set of tasks and environments, which may include datasets. I will look for any specific names or descriptions of datasets used in the evaluation of LLM agents.

In **section 4 (AGENTBOARD – Task Composition)**, the authors detail the various environments and tasks included in AGENTBOARD. I will carefully examine this section for any datasets that are explicitly named or referenced. For instance, they mention environments like **AlfWorld**, **ScienceWorld**, **BabyAI**, **Jericho**, **PDDL**, **WebShop**, **WebArena**, and **Tool-Query**, which may correspond to specific datasets.

I will also check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. For example, if the paper references the original sources of these environments, I will note those citations as they are crucial for proper attribution.

Here are the datasets I will extract based on the information provided in the paper:

1. **AlfWorld**: 
   - Citation: Shridhar, M., Yuan, X., Côté, M.-A., Bisk, Y., Trischler, A., & Hausknecht, M. (2021). *AlfWorld: Aligning Text and Embodied Environments for Interactive Learning*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR).

After identifying these datasets and their citations, I will compile them into a structured format for easy reference and further processing. This systematic approach ensures that I capture all relevant datasets and provide proper citations for each.
