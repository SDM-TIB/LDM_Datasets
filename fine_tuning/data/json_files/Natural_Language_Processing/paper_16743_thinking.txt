To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Drag-A-Video: Non-rigid Video Editing with Point-based Interaction" by Yao Teng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. In the abstract, the authors mention that they demonstrate their method on various videos, which suggests that datasets are involved. I will look for specific names of datasets in these sections.

Next, I will check the **experiments section** (Section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In **Section 4.2 (Qualitative Results)**, the authors explicitly list the datasets they used:

1. **LOVEU-TGVE**: This dataset is referenced as one of the sources for the videos used in their experiments.
2. **DAVIS**: Another dataset mentioned, known for video object segmentation tasks.
3. **WebVid-10M**: This dataset is also included, which is a large-scale dataset for video understanding.

Now, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for each of these datasets. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access these datasets.

- For **LOVEU-TGVE**, the citation is:
  > Max Bain, Arsha Nagrani, Gül Varol, and Andrew Zisserman. *Frozen in time: A joint video and image encoder for end-to-end retrieval*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision, pages 1728–1738, 2021.

- For **DAVIS**, the citation is:
  > Simon Baker, Daniel Scharstein, JP Lewis, Stefan Roth, Michael J Black, and Richard Szeliski. *A database and evaluation methodology for optical flow*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 92:1–31, 2011.

- For **WebVid-10M**, the citation is:
  > Jiahui Huang, Leonid Sigal, Kwang Moo Yi, Oliver Wang, and Joon-Young Lee. *Inve: Interactive neural video editing*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2307.07663, 2023.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research and their respective sources, which is essential for academic integrity and reproducibility in research.
