To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Understanding and Addressing Gender Bias in Expert Finding Task" by Maddalena Amendola et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study utilizes a comprehensive dataset from StackOverflow, which is a significant clue that I need to explore further.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors discuss the importance of the Expert Finding (EF) task and mention the use of a large-scale dataset from StackOverflow. This reinforces the idea that StackOverflow is a primary dataset for their analysis.

In the **methodology section**, particularly in **section 4 (Analyzing and Measuring the Bias in the SO Dataset)**, the authors provide detailed statistics about the dataset used, including the number of questions, answerers, and the percentage of female participants across different time frames. They present a table (Table 1) that summarizes key statistics for various data segments, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's characteristics.

The paper mentions the following datasets:

1. **StackOverflow Dataset (2017-2022)**: This dataset includes over 3 million questions and provides insights into gender representation among answerers. The authors analyze data from different time frames, specifically from 2017 to 2022, and present statistics on the number of questions, answerers, and gender distribution.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the StackOverflow dataset. The authors refer to the publicly available StackOverflow data dump, which can be cited as follows:

- **StackOverflow Dataset**: 
  > Stack Exchange. *Stack Overflow Data Dump*. Available at: https://archive.org/details/stackexchange.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, ensuring that I include the full citation for the StackOverflow dataset as it is crucial for proper attribution.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for review or further processing, ensuring that all details are accurate and complete.
