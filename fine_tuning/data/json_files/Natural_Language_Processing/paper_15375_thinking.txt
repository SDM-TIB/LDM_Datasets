To extract datasets from the research paper titled "UNIX-ENCODER: A Universal X-Channel Speech Encoder for Ad-Hoc Microphone Array Speech Processing" by Zili Huang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors tested their model on a synthetic multi-channel dataset derived from the LibriSpeech corpus, which suggests that this dataset is significant for their research.

Next, I will examine **section 4.1 (Experimental settings)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for pretraining and fine-tuning the UniX-Encoder model. They mention that the model was pretrained on a synthetic multi-channel multi-talker dataset generated from LibriSpeech, and they also reference the use of the WHAM! noise dataset for noise sources.

In detail, I will note the following datasets:

1. **LibriSpeech**: This is a well-known dataset for automatic speech recognition (ASR) tasks. The authors specify that they used the clean utterances from the LibriSpeech corpus, particularly the train-clean-100, dev-clean, and test-clean subsets.

2. **WHAM! Dataset**: This dataset is used for noise sources in their experiments. The authors mention that the noise sources are derived from the train, dev, and test partitions of the WHAM! noise dataset.

Now, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **LibriSpeech**, the citation is:
  > Vassil Panayotov et al., "Librispeech: an asr corpus based on public domain audio books," in ICASSP. IEEE, 2015, pp. 5206–5210.

- For **WHAM!**, the citation is:
  > Gordon Wichern et al., "Wham!: Extending speech separation to noisy environments," Proc. Interspeech 2019, pp. 1368–1372, 2019.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes the full citation as required. This will prepare the information for structured output or further analysis.
