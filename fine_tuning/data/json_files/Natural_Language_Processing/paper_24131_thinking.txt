To extract datasets from the research paper titled "INTERINTENT: Investigating Social Intelligence of LLMs via Intention Understanding in an Interactive Game Context" by Ziyi Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will look for any mention of datasets used for evaluation or experimentation.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments and results sections**. These sections typically contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used, including their characteristics, sizes, and any relevant metrics. I will pay close attention to any specific datasets mentioned in the context of evaluating the LLMs' social intelligence.

In the **discussion section**, the authors may also reference datasets used in previous studies or compare their findings with existing datasets. This could provide additional context or citations that are important for documenting the datasets.

Once I identify the datasets, I will consult the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for ensuring that I have accurate and complete citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper.

For example, if the authors mention a dataset like "Avalon," I will look for the original source or paper that describes this dataset in detail. I will ensure to capture the authors, title, publication venue, and year for each dataset.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation formatted correctly.

Finally, I will organize this information in a clear and structured manner, ready for further processing or review. This systematic approach will help ensure that I accurately capture all relevant datasets from the research paper.
