To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Efficient Time Stepping for Numerical Shape Correspondence" by Alexander Köhler and Michael Breuß, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions an "experimental evaluation of the methods at hand of classical TOSCA data sets," indicating that the TOSCA dataset is likely used in their experiments.

Next, I will examine **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly state that they used a selection of shapes from the **TOSCA dataset** for their experiments. They describe the dataset as containing a total of 80 shapes of animals and humans in different poses, with varying resolutions.

To ensure I have the correct citation for the TOSCA dataset, I will check the **References section** of the paper. The authors cite the TOSCA dataset as follows:

- For the **TOSCA dataset**, the citation is:
  > Bronstein, A.M., Bronstein, M.M., Kimmel, R. *Numerical Geometry of Non-Rigid Shapes*. Springer-Verlag GmbH, 2008.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the findings:

1. **TOSCA Dataset**: This dataset consists of 80 shapes of animals and humans in various poses, with shape resolutions ranging from 4,344 points for the wolf shape to 52,565 points for the David and Michael shapes.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing, ensuring that the full citation for the dataset is included as it is crucial for proper attribution and reference.
