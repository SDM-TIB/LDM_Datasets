To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SONIC: Synergizing VisiON Foundation Models for Stress RecogNItion from ECG signals" by Orchid Chetia Phukan et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that the authors report state-of-the-art performance on the **WESAD benchmark**, indicating that this is a dataset used in their research.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically **section IV (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly state that they used the **WESAD dataset** for their experiments. They describe it as a widely used benchmark dataset in the field of affective computing and wearable computing, which includes physiological data collected from wearable sensors.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide details about the WESAD dataset, including the types of physiological signals it contains (ECG, EDA, EMG, etc.) and the number of participants involved. This confirms that WESAD is the primary dataset utilized in their study.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the WESAD dataset. The citation provided in the references is:

- For **WESAD**:
  > Philip Schmidt, Attila Reiss, Robert Duerichen, Claus Marberger, and Kristof Van Laerhoven. *Introducing WESAD, a multimodal dataset for wearable stress and affect detection*. In Proceedings of the 20th ACM international conference on multimodal interaction, pages 400â€“408, 2018.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets explicitly, I will conclude that the WESAD dataset is the only dataset relevant to this research.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry for WESAD, ensuring to include the full citation as required. This will be ready for any structured output or further processing.
