To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The Progression of Transformers from Language to Vision to MOT: A Literature Review on Multi-Object Tracking with Transformers" by Abhi Kamboj, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections that discuss datasets** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a general overview, but I will focus on the introduction and subsequent sections for specific dataset references.

In the **introduction**, the author discusses the challenges of multi-object tracking (MOT) and mentions various applications, which may hint at the datasets used in this field. 

Next, I will look into **section 4 (Multi Object Tracking)**, where the author explicitly mentions several datasets relevant to MOT. Here are the key datasets identified:

1. **MOT16**: This dataset is a widely used benchmark for multi-object tracking, primarily consisting of surveillance camera footage for tracking humans. The author notes that it includes labels for cars, bicycles, and motorcycles, but these are used mainly as occlusions in the evaluation of human tracking.

2. **Berkeley Deep Drive (BDD)**: This dataset is focused on autonomous driving scenarios and includes diverse driving conditions and scenarios for tracking vehicles and pedestrians.

3. **KITTI**: Another dataset for autonomous driving, it provides various challenges for tracking objects in real-world driving conditions.

4. **Track Any Object (TAO)**: This dataset features a long-tailed distribution of object classes, making it suitable for tracking a variety of objects, including those that appear infrequently.

5. **TAO-Open World**: An extension of TAO, this dataset includes novel objects, aiming to reflect real-world scenarios where models encounter previously unseen objects.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. Here are the citations I will extract:

- For **MOT16**, the citation is:
  > Anton Milan, Laura Leal-Taixé, Ian Reid, Stefan Roth, and Konrad Schindler. *MOT16: A benchmark for multi-object tracking*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1603.00831, 2016.

- For **Berkeley Deep Drive (BDD)**, the citation is:

- For **KITTI**, the citation is:
  > Andreas Geiger, Philip Lenz, and Raquel Urtasun. *Are we ready for autonomous driving? The KITTI vision benchmark suite*. In Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2012.

- For **Track Any Object (TAO)**, the citation is:
  > Achal Dave, Tarasha Khurana, Pavel Tokmakov, Cordelia Schmid, and Deva Ramanan. *TAO: A large-scale benchmark for tracking any object*. In European conference on computer vision, pages 436–454, Springer, 2020.

- For **TAO-Open World**, the citation is:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
