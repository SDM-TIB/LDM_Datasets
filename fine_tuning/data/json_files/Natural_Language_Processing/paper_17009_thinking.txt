To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ScribblePrompt: Fast and Flexible Interactive Segmentation for Any Medical Image" by Hallee E. Wong et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors trained their model on a "diverse collection of 65 open-access biomedical datasets," which suggests that multiple datasets are involved.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **Methods** section, particularly where the authors describe their training and evaluation processes. In the **Data** subsection, the authors explicitly list the datasets used for training and evaluation, which is crucial for my extraction.

I will note the following datasets mentioned in the paper:

1. **MegaMedical**: This is the primary collection from which the authors derived 77 open-access medical imaging datasets for training and evaluation.

2. **ACDC Dataset**: This dataset is used for cardiac segmentation tasks.

3. **BUID Dataset**: This dataset is focused on breast ultrasound images.

4. **BTCV Cervix Dataset**: This dataset is used for cervix segmentation in CT images.

5. **DRIVE Dataset**: This dataset is used for blood vessel segmentation in retinal images.

6. **HipXRay Dataset**: This dataset is used for hip X-ray segmentation.

7. **PanDental Dataset**: This dataset is used for dental segmentation tasks.

8. **SCD Dataset**: This dataset is used for cardiac segmentation.

9. **SCR Dataset**: This dataset is used for segmentation tasks in various medical images.

10. **SpineWeb Dataset**: This dataset is used for vertebrae segmentation.

11. **TotalSegmentator Dataset**: This dataset is used for multi-organ segmentation.

12. **WBC Dataset**: This dataset is used for white blood cell segmentation.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations typically include the authors, title, publication venue, and year. 

For example, I will look for:

- **ACDC Dataset** citation:
  > Bernard, O., Lalande, A., Zotti, C., Cervenansky, F., Heng, P.-A., et al. "Deep learning techniques for automatic MRI cardiac multi-structures segmentation and diagnosis: is the problem solved?" *IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging*, 37(11):2514–2525, 2018.

- **BUID Dataset** citation:
  > Al-Dhabyani, W., Gomaa, M., Khaled, H., and Fahmy, A. "Dataset of breast ultrasound images." *Data in Brief*, 28:104863, 2020.

- **BTCV Cervix Dataset** citation:
  > Bernard, O., et al. "Deep learning techniques for automatic MRI cardiac multi-structures segmentation and diagnosis: is the problem solved?" *IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging*, 37(11):2514–2525, 2018.

I will continue this process for each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring that I accurately capture the full citation details.

Finally, I will compile all the extracted datasets and their citations into a structured format for easy reference and further processing.
