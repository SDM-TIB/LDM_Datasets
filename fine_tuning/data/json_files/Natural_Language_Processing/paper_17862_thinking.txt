To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Tuning LLMs with Contrastive Alignment Instructions for Machine Translation in Unseen, Low-resource Languages" by Zhuoyuan Mao and Yen Yu, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract highlights the challenges of machine translation (MT) for low-resource languages, which suggests that datasets are likely involved in the experiments.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of existing multilingual models and the need for datasets that support low-resource languages. This indicates that they may reference specific datasets later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, where the authors describe their approach to fine-tuning the BLOOMZ models. They mention using the **OPUS-100** and **Flores-200** datasets for evaluation. This is a clear indication that these datasets are crucial for their experiments.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide details about how they fine-tuned the models using these datasets. They mention that OPUS-100 is an English-centric parallel corpus with around 4.5 million parallel sentences for 24 selected languages, while Flores-200 is used for evaluating translation quality across various languages.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. **OPUS-100**:
   > Zhang, B., Williams, P., Titov, I., & Sennrich, R. (2020). Improving massively multilingual neural machine translation and zero-shot translation. In Proceedings of the 58th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL), pages 1628–1639.

2. **Flores-200**:
   > Costa-jussà, M. R., Cross, J., Çelebi, O., Elbayad, M., Heafield, K., Heffernan, K., Kalbassi, E., Lam, J., Licht, D., Maillard, J., Sun, A., Wang, G., Wenzek, G., & Youngblood, A. (2022). No language left behind: Scaling human-centered machine translation. CoRR, abs/2207.04672.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations.
