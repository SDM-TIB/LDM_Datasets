To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Large Language Models are Zero-Shot Reasoners" by Takeshi Kojima et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their method on various benchmark reasoning tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved. I will look for specific names of datasets in these sections.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly the part where the authors describe the tasks and datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they explicitly list several datasets used for different types of reasoning tasks. I will note down each dataset mentioned along with any relevant details provided by the authors.

The paper lists the following datasets:

1. **MultiArith**: A dataset for arithmetic reasoning tasks. The authors mention that it includes various arithmetic problems that require multi-step reasoning.

2. **GSM8K**: Another dataset for arithmetic reasoning, which consists of grade school math problems.

3. **AQUA-RAT**: A dataset designed for question answering that requires reasoning over multiple steps.

4. **SVAMP**: A dataset that focuses on arithmetic word problems requiring multi-step reasoning.

5. **CommonsenseQA**: A dataset for commonsense reasoning tasks that involves multiple-choice questions.

6. **StrategyQA**: Another commonsense reasoning dataset that requires multi-hop reasoning.

7. **Date Understanding**: A logical reasoning task that involves inferring dates from context.

8. **Tracking Shuffled Objects**: A logical reasoning task that tests the ability to track objects through a series of movements.

9. **Last Letter**: A symbolic reasoning task where the model must concatenate the last letters of given words.

10. **Coin Flip**: A symbolic reasoning task that involves determining the state of a coin after a series of flips.

After identifying these datasets, I will then refer to the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets.

The citations I will include are:

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset along with its citation, ensuring that the extraction process is thorough and accurate.
