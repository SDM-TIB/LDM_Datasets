To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Construction Grammar and Language Models" by Harish Tayyar Madabushi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections that discuss experiments or methodologies** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract provides a general overview, but I will focus on sections that explicitly mention datasets or corpora used in the research.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **methodology or experiments sections**. For instance, I will check if the authors describe any datasets they used for training or evaluating their models. In this paper, the authors discuss the use of various language models and their training on large corpora, which may imply the existence of specific datasets.

As I read through the paper, I will take note of any datasets mentioned, including their names, descriptions, and the context in which they were used. For example, if the authors refer to a specific corpus like the **ukWac web-crawled corpus**, I will ensure to capture its details.

Once I identify the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access the datasets themselves.

For instance, if I find that the authors used the **ukWac web-crawled corpus**, I will look for the citation:
> Baroni, M., Bernardini, S., Ferraresi, A., & Zanchetta, E. (2009). The WaCky wide web: A collection of very large linguistically processed web-crawled corpora. Language Resources and Evaluation, 43(3), 209â€“226.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format, ready for further processing or review.
