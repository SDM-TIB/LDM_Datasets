To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Two Counterexamples to Tokenization and the Noiseless Channel" by Marco Cognetta et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract discusses the evaluation of tokenizers but does not explicitly mention any datasets. I will then proceed to the **main body of the paper**, focusing on sections that typically contain dataset information, such as the **experiments** section.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **Datasets** section or any subsection that discusses the datasets used in the experiments. In this paper, the authors describe their experiments in section 5, where they mention using the **iwslt14 German→English corpus** for training their models. This is a clear indication of a dataset being utilized.

Now, I will gather the full citation for the **iwslt14 German→English corpus** from the references section. The citation is as follows:
> Cettolo, M., Girardi, C., & Federico, M. (2012). *WIT3: Web Inventory of Transcribed and Translated Talks*. In Proceedings of the Eighth International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC 2012), Istanbul, Turkey.

Since this is the only dataset mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information regarding this dataset.

Finally, I will summarize the findings, ensuring that I have the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation ready for presentation or further processing. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details regarding the datasets used in the research.
