To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Federated Learning in IoT: a Survey from a Resource-Constrained Perspective" by Ishmeet Kaur and Adwaita Janardhan Jadhav, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections discussing methodologies and experiments** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a general overview of the paper's focus on Federated Learning (FL) in IoT environments, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any references to datasets used in the context of FL or IoT. The introduction discusses the challenges and applications of FL in IoT but does not specify any datasets.

I will then look into the **subsequent sections**, particularly those that discuss evaluation metrics and experiments. In the **Discussion and Conclusion** section, the authors propose evaluation metrics and mention the use of datasets like **CIFAR-10** and **ImageNet** for testing FL techniques. They also suggest that testing on datasets such as **Market-1501** may be more valuable for real-world applications.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets:

1. **CIFAR-10**: The citation is:
   > Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. *CIFAR-10: Canadian Institute for Advanced Research*. 2009.

2. **ImageNet**: The citation is:
   > Olga Russakovsky et al. *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. In: International Journal of Computer Vision 115.3 (2015), pp. 211â€“252.

3. **Market-1501**: The citation is:
   > Zheng Liu et al. *Market-1501: A Dataset and a Method for Person Re-Identification*. In: European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV). 2016.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as they are crucial for proper attribution and further research.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for easy reference and potential downstream processing.
