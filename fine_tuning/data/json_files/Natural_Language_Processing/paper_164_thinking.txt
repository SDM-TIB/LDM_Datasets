To extract datasets from the research paper titled "PoincarÃ© GLOVE: Hyperbolic Word Embeddings" by Alexandru Tifrea et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract discusses the evaluation of their method on various tasks, which may imply the use of specific datasets.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (section 9) closely, as this is typically where datasets are explicitly mentioned. I will look for any references to datasets used for training or evaluation, including their names and descriptions.

In this paper, the authors mention using a corpus derived from an English Wikipedia dump containing 1.4 billion tokens. This indicates that the dataset is substantial and relevant for their experiments. However, I need to ensure I capture the exact name and details of this dataset.

I will also check the **references section** to find any citations related to the datasets mentioned. For example, if the authors refer to any specific datasets or corpora, I will look for the corresponding citations to provide full references.

From my reading, I identify the following datasets:

1. **Wikipedia Corpus**: This dataset is derived from an English Wikipedia dump and contains 1.4 billion tokens. It is used for training the word embeddings in the experiments.

The citation for the Wikipedia dataset is not explicitly provided in the paper, but I can reference the general source as follows:
   > Levy, O., & Goldberg, Y. (2014). Linguistic regularities in sparse and explicit word representations. In Proceedings of the Eighteenth Conference on Computational Natural Language Learning (pp. 171-180). Association for Computational Linguistics.

Now, I will compile the dataset information, ensuring to include the full citation for the Wikipedia dataset.

After gathering all necessary information, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for further processing or review.
