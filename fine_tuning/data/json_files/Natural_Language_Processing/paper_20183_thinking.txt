To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Mapping High-level Semantic Regions in Indoor Environments without Object Recognition" by Roberto Bigazzi et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors collected an offline dataset of RGB-D observations paired with ground-truth region maps, which suggests that a dataset is indeed present.

Next, I will focus on **section IV (Proposed Method)**, specifically the subsection titled **A. Dataset**. Here, the authors describe the dataset extraction procedure in detail. They mention that the dataset consists of RGB-D observations and corresponding top-down ground-truth region maps, extracted from the Matterport3D dataset using the Habitat simulator. This section provides crucial information about the dataset's characteristics, including the number of samples and the training/validation splits.

The authors state that they collected a total of **236,000 samples**, divided into **228,000 for training** and **8,000 for validation**. They also mention the specific environments used for the dataset, which are contained in the Matterport3D dataset.

Now, I will look for the **full citation** of the Matterport3D dataset in the **References section** to ensure I have the correct source for the dataset. The citation for the Matterport3D dataset is:

> A. Chang, A. Dai, T. Funkhouser, et al. *Matterport3D: Learning from RGB-D Data in Indoor Environments*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on 3D Vision, 2017.

Additionally, I will note that the authors mention using a state-of-the-art exploration method and the Habitat simulator, which are relevant to the dataset collection but do not constitute separate datasets.

In summary, the key dataset extracted from the paper is the RGB-D observation dataset paired with ground-truth region maps, derived from the Matterport3D dataset. I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing.
