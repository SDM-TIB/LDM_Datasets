To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Conformal Prediction with Learned Features" by Shayan Kiyani, George Pappas, and Hamed Hassani, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract states that the experimental results are based on "four real-world and synthetic datasets," which indicates that there are multiple datasets to look for.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental results section** (Section 4) where the authors describe their experiments in detail. Here, they mention specific datasets used for their evaluations:

1. **2018 US Census Data**: This dataset is sourced from the Folktables library and is used for income prediction, focusing on demographic details like gender, race, and age.

2. **MNIST Dataset**: This well-known dataset is used for digit recognition tasks and is split into training and calibration/testing sets with varying levels of Gaussian blur applied to create out-of-distribution scenarios.

3. **Synthetic Regression Task Dataset**: This dataset is generated for a specific regression task, described in the context of the experiments comparing PLCP with other methods.

4. **RxRx1 Dataset**: This dataset consists of images of cells used for predicting genetic treatments, sourced from the WILDS repository.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **2018 US Census Data**, the citation is:
  > Ding, F., Hardt, M., Miller, J., & Schmidt, L. (2021). Retiring adult: New datasets for fair machine learning. *Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems*, 34.

- For **MNIST Dataset**, the citation is:
  > LeCun, Y., Cortes, C., & Burges, C. (1998). MNIST handwritten digit database. *AT&T Labs*.

- For the **Synthetic Regression Task**, since it is generated data, it may not have a formal citation but can be referenced as:
  > Synthetic dataset generated for regression tasks as described in the paper.

- For **RxRx1 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Taylor, J., Earnshaw, B., Mabey, B., Victors, M., & Yosinski, J. (2019). Rxrx1: An image set for cellular morphological variation across many experimental batches. In *International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR)*.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
