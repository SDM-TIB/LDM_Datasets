To extract datasets from the research paper titled "IR-BERT: Leveraging BERT for Semantic Search in Background Linking for News Articles" by Anup Anand Deshmukh and Udhav Sethi, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their methods on the **TREC 2018 Washington Post dataset**, which is a strong indication that this dataset is significant for their research.

Next, I will look into **section 4 (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors describe their dataset preprocessing. They mention using the **Washington Post Corpus** released by TREC for the 2018 news track, which contains 608,180 news articles and blog posts. This section provides essential details about the dataset, including its size and the time frame of the articles.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the TREC 2018 Washington Post dataset. The citation is typically found in the references, and it is crucial to include it for proper attribution.

The citation for the dataset is:
> TREC. 2018. Washington Post Corpus. Retrieved from https://trec.nist.gov/data/wapost/

Now, I will compile the information I have gathered about the dataset into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation as required.

After completing these steps, I will have a clear entry for the dataset used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
