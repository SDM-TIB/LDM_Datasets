To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Volta at SemEval-2021 Task 9: Statement Verification and Evidence Finding with Tables using TAPAS and Transfer Learning" by Devansh Gautam et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the paper discusses a task involving statement verification and evidence finding with tables, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section** where the authors mention SemEval 2021 Task 9, which is specifically about verifying statements using tables from scientific articles. This section may provide insights into the datasets used for this task.

In the **experimental setup section**, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets. The authors refer to the dataset provided by the task organizers for both subtasks A and B. They also mention the statistics and official splits of the datasets in Table 2, which is crucial for understanding the datasets' structure and content.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors used the **SEM-TAB-FACTS dataset** for both subtasks. This dataset is specifically designed for the task of statement verification and evidence finding with tables.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the SEM-TAB-FACTS dataset. The relevant citation is:
> Nancy Xin Ru Wang, Diwakar Mahajan, Marina Danilevsky, and Sara Rosenthal. *SemEval-2021 Task 9: A fact verification and evidence finding dataset for tabular data in scientific documents*. In Proceedings of the 15th international workshop on semantic evaluation (SemEval-2021).

I will compile this information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the dataset as it is essential for proper attribution.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for the SEM-TAB-FACTS dataset, ensuring that all relevant details are captured accurately.
