To extract datasets from the research paper titled "RL-MPCA: A Reinforcement Learning Based Multi-Phase Computation Allocation Approach for Recommender Systems" by Jiahong Zhou et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often highlights the datasets used in the study. 

In the **introduction**, I will look for any mentions of datasets or data sources that the authors reference. If they mention specific datasets or provide context about the data used for experiments, I will note those down.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly **subsections 5.1.1 (Dataset)** and **5.1.2 (Offline Simulation System)**. Here, the authors describe the dataset they collected for their experiments. They mention that they sampled **568,842,204 requests from 101,368,290 users**, which includes various user profile features, context features, and time slice features. This indicates a large-scale dataset used for their analysis.

I will also check the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. In this case, the authors do not cite external datasets but rather describe their own dataset collected from the Meituan advertising system.

Since the dataset is derived from their own system, I will create a citation for it based on the information provided in the paper. The citation will include the authors, title, and a brief description of the dataset.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format:

1. **Meituan Advertising System Dataset**: This dataset consists of 568,842,204 requests from 101,368,290 users, including user profile features, context features, and time slice features.

The citation for this dataset will be:
> Jiahong Zhou, Shunhui Mao, Guoliang Yang, Bo Tang, Qianlong Xie, Lebin Lin, Xingxing Wang, and Dong Wang. 2023. Dataset collected from the Meituan advertising system, comprising 568,842,204 requests from 101,368,290 users. In Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023 (WWW â€™23), April 30-May 4, 2023, Austin, TX, USA. ACM, New York, NY, USA.

After gathering all this information, I will ensure that it is presented clearly and accurately, ready for any further processing or review.
