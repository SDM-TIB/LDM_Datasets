To extract datasets from the research paper titled "QuantTune: Optimizing Model Quantization with Adaptive Outlier-Driven Fine Tuning" by Jiun-Man Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of the proposed method on various Transformer-based models, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 5), where the authors detail their evaluation methods. Here, they mention using the **ImageNet-1K dataset** for assessing the performance of their proposed method on vision Transformers. This is a significant dataset in the field of computer vision.

Additionally, I will look for any other datasets mentioned in the context of language models. The authors state that they utilized the **GLUE benchmark** for evaluating the BERT model and the **LAMBADA dataset** for assessing the OPT model. Both of these datasets are well-known in the natural language processing community.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to retrieve the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **ImageNet-1K dataset**, the citation is:
   > Deng, J., Dong, W., Socher, R., Li, L.J., Li, K., Fei-Fei, L. "Imagenet: A large-scale hierarchical image database." In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 248–255, 2009.

2. For the **GLUE benchmark**, the citation is:
   > Wang, A., Singh, A., Michael, J., Hill, F., Levy, O., Bowman, S.R. "GLUE: A multi-task benchmark and analysis platform for natural language understanding." In Proceedings of the 2018 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, Volume 1 (Long Papers), pages 391–401, 2018.

3. For the **LAMBADA dataset**, the citation is:
   > Paperno, D., Kruszewski, G., Lazaridou, A., Pham, Q.N., Bernardi, R., Pezzelle, S., Baroni, M., Boleda, G., Fernández, R. "The lambada dataset: Word prediction requiring a broad discourse context." In Proceedings of the 27th International Conference on Computational Linguistics, pages 1–10, 2016.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all details are accurately represented for future reference or processing.
