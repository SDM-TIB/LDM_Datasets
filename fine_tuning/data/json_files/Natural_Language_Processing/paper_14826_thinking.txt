To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Preliminary Results of a Scientometric Analysis of the German Information Retrieval Community 2020-2023" by Philipp Schaer et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors generated a dataset of **401 recent IR-related publications** extracted from six core IR conferences. This indicates that a dataset is indeed present.

Next, I will focus on the **Data Set Generation section** (Section 3), where the authors describe how they compiled the dataset. They mention that they analyzed the proceedings of six major IR-related conferences (CHIIR, CIKM, CLEF, ECIR, SIGIR, WWW) and gathered metadata such as author names, affiliations, titles, and DOIs. This section provides crucial details about the dataset's content and its purpose.

The authors also mention that the dataset is **publicly available in a GitHub repository**. This is an important detail as it allows me to locate the dataset for further verification and citation.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. However, since the dataset is a compilation of publications from various conferences, it may not have a single citation. Instead, I will note the conferences involved and the GitHub repository link provided in the paper.

The relevant citation for the dataset is:
> Schaer, P., Myshkina, S., & Keller, J. (2023). Preliminary Results of a Scientometric Analysis of the German Information Retrieval Community 2020-2023. In Proceedings of the LWDA 2023 Workshops: BIA, DB, IR, KDML and WM. Marburg, Germany, 09.-11. October 2023. Available at: https://github.com/irgroup/LWDA2023-IR-community

Now, I will summarize the dataset details:

1. **Dataset Name**: German Information Retrieval Publications Dataset
   - **Description**: A dataset containing metadata of 401 recent IR-related publications extracted from six core IR conferences (CHIIR, CIKM, CLEF, ECIR, SIGIR, WWW) from January 2020 to June 2023.
   - **Link**: https://github.com/irgroup/LWDA2023-IR-community
   - **Citation**: Schaer, P., Myshkina, S., & Keller, J. (2023). Preliminary Results of a Scientometric Analysis of the German Information Retrieval Community 2020-2023. In Proceedings of the LWDA 2023 Workshops: BIA, DB, IR, KDML and WM. Marburg, Germany, 09.-11. October 2023.

With this information, I can now compile the dataset entry into the required format for further processing or review.
