To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Improving Vision Anomaly Detection with the Guidance of Language Modality" by Dong Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for evaluation. The introduction typically outlines the context and significance of the study, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly the subsection titled **"Datasets and Settings."** This section is likely to contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the experiments. Here, the authors mention three different multimodal datasets:

1. **Class-COCO**: This dataset is based on the MS COCO dataset and includes 45,205 normal samples and 15,150 samples regarded as anomalies. The citation for this dataset is:
   > D. Chen, Y. Zhuang, Z. Shen, C. Yang, G. Wang, S. Tang, and Y. Yang. "Cross-modal data augmentation for tasks of different modalities." *IEEE Transactions on Multimedia*, 2022.

2. **UCM Caption**: This dataset contains 21 classes of land use images, with 5 different sentences describing each image. The authors selected 6 classes as normal samples and 15 classes as anomalies. The citation for this dataset is:
   > B. Qu, X. Li, D. Tao, and X. Lu. "Deep semantic understanding of high resolution remote sensing image." In *2016 International conference on computer, information and telecommunication systems (Cits)*, IEEE, 2016.

3. **Wikipedia**: This dataset consists of 2,866 image-text pairs belonging to 10 classes, divided into normal samples (4 classes) and abnormal samples (6 classes). The citation for this dataset is:
   > N. Rasiwasia, J. Costa Pereira, E. Coviello, G. Doyle, G. R. Lanckriet, R. Levy, and N. Vasconcelos. "A new approach to cross-modal multimedia retrieval." In *Proceedings of the 18th ACM international conference on Multimedia*, 2010.

After identifying these datasets, I will verify their descriptions and ensure that I have captured the necessary details about each dataset, including their purpose and the context in which they were used in the experiments.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information along with their full citations into a structured format for easy reference and further processing. This will ensure that I have accurately documented the datasets used in the research paper.
