To extract datasets from the research paper titled "AMAGO: Scalable In-Context Reinforcement Learning for Adaptive Agents" by Jake Grigsby et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned or referenced. The abstract discusses the performance of AMAGO in various benchmarks, which may indicate the use of specific datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they mention that AMAGO was evaluated on the **POPGym suite**, which is a benchmark for evaluating long-term memory and generalization in reinforcement learning. This indicates that the POPGym suite is a dataset used in their experiments.

I will also look for any additional datasets mentioned in the **related work** or **conclusion sections**. The authors may reference other datasets that are relevant to their work or that they compared their results against.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. For the **POPGym suite**, the citation is:
> Steven Morad et al. "POPGym: Benchmarking Partially Observable Reinforcement Learning". In: The Eleventh International Conference on Learning Representations. 2023. URL: https://openreview.net/forum?id=chDrutUTs0K.

Next, I will summarize the datasets identified:

1. **POPGym Suite**: A benchmark for evaluating long-term memory and generalization in reinforcement learning. It includes various environments designed to test different aspects of reinforcement learning agents.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and full citation, ensuring that all necessary details are captured for future reference or processing.
