To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Arithmetic Control of LLMs for Diverse User Preferences: Directional Preference Alignment with Multi-Objective Rewards" by Haoxiang Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and the introduction often highlights the datasets used for experiments.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences and mention the use of reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). However, they do not specify any datasets at this point.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where datasets are typically detailed. In this paper, the authors mention two datasets used for their experiments: **HelpSteer** and **UltraFeedback**.

1. **HelpSteer**: This dataset comprises 10,000 prompts and 37,000 annotated responses, with five attributes: helpfulness, correctness, coherence, complexity, and verbosity. The responses were generated by a closed-source LLM and annotated by human labelers on a scale of 0-4 for each attribute.

2. **UltraFeedback**: This dataset includes 64,000 prompts, each associated with four responses rated on five attributes: honesty, truthfulness, instruction-following, helpfulness, and overall score. The responses were labeled using GPT-4.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution.

- For **HelpSteer**, the citation is:
  > Wang, Z., Dong, Y., Zeng, J., Adams, V., Sreedhar, M. N., Egert, D., Delalleau, O., Scowcroft, J. P., Kant, N., & Swope, A. (2023). HelpSteer: Multi-attribute helpfulness dataset for SteerLM. arXiv preprint arXiv:2311.09528.

- For **UltraFeedback**, the citation is:
  > Cui, G., Yuan, L., Ding, N., Yao, G., Zhu, W., Ni, Y., Xie, G., Liu, Z., & Sun, M. (2023). UltraFeedback: Boosting language models with high-quality feedback. arXiv preprint arXiv:2306.12420.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture the necessary details for each dataset mentioned in the paper.
