To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Label-efficient Segmentation via Affinity Propagation" by Wentong Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on three typical label-efficient segmentation tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors describe their methodology and the datasets used. In **section 4.1**, they explicitly mention two datasets for the weakly box-supervised instance segmentation task:

1. **COCO Dataset**: This dataset is widely used in computer vision, containing 80 classes with 115K training images and 5K validation images.

2. **Pascal VOC Dataset**: The authors refer to the Pascal VOC dataset augmented by SBD, which includes 20 classes with 10,582 training images and 1,449 validation images.

In **section 4.2**, they mention using the **Pascal VOC 2012 dataset** for weakly-supervised semantic segmentation, which contains 20 object categories and a background class.

In **section 4.3**, they discuss experiments on **Pascal Context** and **COCO-Stuff** datasets, which are also widely used for semantic segmentation tasks.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **COCO Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, Serge Belongie, James Hays, Pietro Perona, Deva Ramanan, Piotr Dollár, and C Lawrence Zitnick. *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. In European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), pages 740–755, 2014.

- For the **Pascal VOC Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Mark Everingham, Luc Van Gool, Christopher KI Williams, John Winn, and Andrew Zisserman. *The Pascal Visual Object Classes (VOC) Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 88(2):303–338, 2010.

- For the **Pascal Context Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Roozbeh Mottaghi, Xianjie Chen, Xiaobai Liu, Nam-Gyu Cho, Seong-Whan Lee, Sanja Fidler, Raquel Urtasun, and Alan Yuille. *The Role of Context for Object Detection and Semantic Segmentation in the Wild*. In CVPR, pages 891–898, 2014.

- For the **COCO-Stuff Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Holger Caesar, Jasper Uijlings, and Vittorio Ferrari. *COCO-Stuff: Thing and Stuff Classes in Context*. In CVPR, 2018.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
