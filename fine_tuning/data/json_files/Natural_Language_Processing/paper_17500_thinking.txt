To extract datasets from the research paper titled "FALCON: Feature-Label Constrained Graph Net Collapse for Memory Efficient GNNs" by Christopher Adnel and Islem Rekik, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that FALCON can significantly collapse various public datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed used in the research.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors evaluate FALCON on four public datasets. I will look for specific mentions of these datasets and their characteristics. The relevant datasets mentioned are:

1. **PPI Dataset**: This dataset is used for multi-label classification tasks and consists of 56,944 nodes and 1,587,264 edges.

2. **Flickr Dataset**: This dataset is also used for multi-label classification and contains 89,250 nodes and 899,756 edges.

3. **MedMNIST Organ-S Dataset**: This dataset is used for multi-class classification and has 25,221 nodes and 1,276,046 edges.

4. **MedMNIST Organ-C Dataset**: Similar to Organ-S, this dataset is used for multi-class classification with 23,660 nodes and 1,241,622 edges.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For the **PPI Dataset**:

- For the **Flickr Dataset**:
  > Zeng, H., Zhou, H., Srivastava, A., Kannan, R., & Prasanna, V. (2020). GraphSAINT: Graph sampling based inductive learning method. In *International Conference on Learning Representations*.

- For the **MedMNIST Organ-S Dataset**:
  > Yang, J., Shi, R., Wei, D., Liu, Z., Zhao, L., Ke, B., Pfister, H., & Ni, B. (2023). Medmnist v2-a large-scale lightweight benchmark for 2d and 3d biomedical image classification. *Scientific Data*, 10(1), 41.

- For the **MedMNIST Organ-C Dataset**:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations.
