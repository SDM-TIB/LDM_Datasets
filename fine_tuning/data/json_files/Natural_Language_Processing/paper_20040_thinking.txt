To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Testing Business Cycle Theories: Evidence from the Great Recession" by Bo Li, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

1. **Read the Abstract and Introduction**: I will start by examining the abstract and introduction sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a summary of the research focus, and the introduction often outlines the datasets used for analysis.

2. **Identify Sections Related to Data**: Next, I will look for sections explicitly discussing data sources, such as "Data Sources" or "Datasets." In this paper, section 3 titled "Data Sources" is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets used.

3. **Extract Dataset Information**: In section 3, I will carefully read through subsections (3.1 to 3.4) to gather information about each dataset. I will note the names of the datasets, their descriptions, and any relevant statistics or characteristics mentioned.

4. **Check for Citations**: As I extract information about each dataset, I will also look for citations in the references section. This is crucial for providing full citations for each dataset. I will ensure that I capture the authors, title, publication details, and any other relevant information.

5. **Compile Dataset Entries**: After gathering all necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes:
   - The name of the dataset
   - A brief description of the dataset
   - The full citation for the dataset as found in the references section.

6. **Review for Completeness**: Finally, I will review the extracted information to ensure that I have not missed any datasets and that all citations are accurate and complete.

By following these steps, I will be able to extract the datasets from the paper effectively and provide the necessary citations for each dataset.
