To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Rethinking Intermediate Layers Design in Knowledge Distillation for Kidney and Liver Tumor Segmentation" by Vandan Gorade et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the application of knowledge distillation (KD) in medical imaging tasks, specifically kidney and liver tumor segmentation, which suggests that datasets related to these tasks might be discussed later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors explicitly mention the datasets in the **Experiments** section. They state that they evaluated their techniques on two datasets: **KiTS** and **LiTS**.

1. **KiTS Dataset**: The authors describe it as comprising 210 abdominal CT scans, with a training/testing split of 168:42. This dataset is crucial for their kidney tumor segmentation experiments.

2. **LiTS Dataset**: This dataset consists of 201 CT scans, with a training/testing split of 131:70, and is used for liver tumor segmentation tasks.

Now, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **KiTS Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Nicholas Heller, Niranjan Sathianathen, Arveen Kalapara, Edward Walczak, Keenan Moore, Heather Kaluzniak, Joel Rosenberg, Paul Blake, Zachary Rengel, Makinna Oestreich, et al. "The KiTS19 Challenge Data: 300 Kidney Tumor Cases with Clinical Context, CT Semantic Segmentations, and Surgical Outcomes." *arXiv preprint arXiv:1904.00445*, 2019.

- For the **LiTS Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Gabriel Chartrand, et al. "The Liver Tumor Segmentation Benchmark (LiTS)." *Medical Image Analysis*, vol. 84, pp. 102680, 2023.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will allow for a comprehensive understanding of the datasets used in the research and their significance in the context of the study.
