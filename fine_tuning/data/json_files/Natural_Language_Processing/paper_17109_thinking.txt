To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Explainable AI in Grassland Monitoring: Enhancing Model Performance and Domain Adaptability" by Shanghua Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract highlights challenges in automating the identification of indicator plants due to the scarcity of extensive datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed a focus of the research.

Next, I will examine **section 3 (Experiments)**, specifically **subsection 3.1 (Data and Modeling Setup)**, where the authors describe the dataset used in their experiments. Here, they mention a dataset proposed by Basavegowda et al. [Ba22], which includes RGB images from three different sources: greenhouse, experimental grassland, and semi-natural grasslands, featuring four indicator species: Armeria maritima, Campanula patula, Cirsium oleraceum, and Daucus carota. This section provides detailed information about the dataset's composition and its relevance to the study.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset mentioned. The citation for the dataset proposed by Basavegowda et al. is as follows:
- Basavegowda, Deepak Hanike; Mosebach, Paul; Schleip, Inga; Weltzien, Cornelia: Indicator plant species detection in grassland using EfficientDet object detector. In: 42. GIL-Jahrestagung, Künstliche Intelligenz in der Agrar- und Ernährungswirtschaft, pp. 57–62. Gesellschaft für Informatik e.V., Bonn, 2022.

Additionally, I will look for any other datasets referenced in the paper. The authors mention using the **COCO dataset** for pre-training their models. I will retrieve the citation for the COCO dataset as well:
- Deng, Jia; Dong, Wei; Socher, Richard; Li, Li-Jia; Li, Kai; Fei-Fei, Li: ImageNet: A large-scale hierarchical image database. In: 2009 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition. pp. 248–255, 2009.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research, along with their authoritative references.
