To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Data-Driven Ergonomic Risk Assessment of Complex Hand-intensive Manufacturing Processes" by Anand Krishnan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on ergonomic risk assessment, which may hint at the types of data collected.

Next, I will pay close attention to the **methods section**, particularly the **data collection** subsection. This section typically contains detailed information about the datasets used, including the types of data collected, the sensors employed, and the number of participants involved. Here, the authors describe the multi-modal sensor testbed and the specific types of data collected, such as 3D upper body pose, hand pose, and applied forces.

In the **results section**, I will look for any references to the datasets used in the analysis or any results derived from them. This may include performance metrics or comparisons based on the datasets.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets or methodologies referenced in the paper. This is crucial for providing proper attribution and context for the datasets.

From my reading, I can identify the following datasets:

1. **Multi-modal Sensor Data**: This dataset includes 3D upper body pose, hand pose, and applied forces collected from participants performing hand-intensive manufacturing tasks. The data is collected using various sensors, including a Leap Motion controller, goniometers, and force-sensing gloves.

2. **Annotated Ergonomic Scores**: The dataset includes annotations for industry-standard ergonomic scores such as RULA (Rapid Upper Limb Assessment) and HAL (Hand Activity Level), which are derived from the sensor data.

Next, I will ensure to document the full citations for any relevant methodologies or datasets mentioned in the references. For example, if the authors reference specific ergonomic assessment methodologies or previous studies that contributed to their dataset, I will include those citations.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes a clear description of the dataset, its purpose, and the full citation for any referenced works. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture the datasets used in the research paper and provide proper attribution.
