To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CausalChaos! Dataset for Comprehensive Causal Action Question Answering Over Longer Causal Chains Grounded in Dynamic Visual Scenes" by Paritosh Parmar et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract introduces the **CausalChaos! dataset**, which is the primary focus of the paper. This indicates that there is at least one dataset to extract.

Next, I will look for detailed descriptions of the dataset in the **Methods section**. In this section, the authors describe the construction of the **CausalChaos! dataset**, which is based on the "Tom and Jerry" cartoon series. They mention that the dataset includes 4,945 detailed Question-Answer-Explanation (QAE) sets, which is crucial information for understanding the dataset's scope.

I will also check the **Related Work section** to see if the authors reference any other datasets that are relevant to their work. They mention several existing datasets like **CLEVRER**, **NextQA**, **CausalVidQA**, and **IntentQA**, but they focus on how their dataset addresses limitations in these existing datasets.

In the **Experiments section**, the authors benchmark their dataset against various state-of-the-art VideoQA methods, which further confirms the significance of the **CausalChaos! dataset** in the context of their research.

Finally, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citation for the **CausalChaos! dataset**. The authors do not provide a separate citation for the dataset itself, but they do mention that the dataset is available on GitHub, which I will note.

The full citation for the paper is:
> Paritosh Parmar, Eric Peh, Ruirui Chen, Ting En Lam, Yuhan Chen, Elston Tan, Basura Fernando. *CausalChaos! Dataset for Comprehensive Causal Action Question Answering Over Longer Causal Chains Grounded in Dynamic Visual Scenes*. Preprint. Under review. Available at: https://github.com/LUNAProject22/CausalChaos

Now, I will summarize the extracted dataset information:

1. **CausalChaos! Dataset**: A dataset for causal video question answering based on the "Tom and Jerry" cartoon series, containing 4,945 QAE sets.

With this information, I will prepare to format the dataset details according to the required structure, ensuring that the full citation is included for the **CausalChaos! dataset**.
