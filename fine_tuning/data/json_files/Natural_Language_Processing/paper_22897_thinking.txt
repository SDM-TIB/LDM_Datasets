To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Vision Transformer with Sparse Scan Prior" by Qihang Fan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the proposed model, SSViT, is validated across a variety of tasks, which suggests that multiple datasets may be involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they mention conducting experiments on several vision tasks, including image classification on **ImageNet-1k**, object detection and instance segmentation on **COCO**, and semantic segmentation on **ADE20K**. This indicates that these datasets are likely used in their experiments.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The relevant citations are as follows:

1. **ImageNet-1k**: 
   > Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, et al. *Imagenet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In CVPR, 2009.

2. **COCO**: 
   > Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, Serge Belongie, et al. *Microsoft coco: Common objects in context*. In ECCV, 2014.

3. **ADE20K**: 
   > Bolei Zhou, Hang Zhao, Xavier Puig, et al. *Scene parsing through ade20k dataset*. In CVPR, 2017.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will summarize the information for each dataset:

1. **ImageNet-1k**: A large-scale dataset used for image classification tasks, containing a diverse set of images across 1,000 categories.

2. **COCO**: A dataset designed for object detection, segmentation, and captioning, featuring images with complex scenes and multiple objects.

3. **ADE20K**: A dataset for semantic segmentation that includes images annotated with object and stuff categories, providing a comprehensive understanding of scene parsing.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use, ensuring that each dataset is clearly identified along with its full citation. This will facilitate easy reference and verification in future work.
