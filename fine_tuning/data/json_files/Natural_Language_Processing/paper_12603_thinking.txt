To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Improving Realistic Worst-Case Performance of NVCiM DNN Accelerators through Training with Right-Censored Gaussian Noise" by Zheyu Yan et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research but may not specify datasets. The introduction often discusses related works and may reference datasets used in prior studies.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental evaluation section**. This section typically contains detailed information about the datasets used for training and testing the models. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names and descriptions.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention using the **MNIST dataset** and the **CIFAR-10 dataset** for their experiments. I will note down the details provided about these datasets, including their purpose and any specific configurations used in the experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

For the **MNIST dataset**, the citation is:
> Y. LeCun, L. Bottou, Y. Bengio, and P. Haffner. "Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition." *Proceedings of the IEEE*, vol. 86, no. 11, pp. 2278â€“2324, 1998.

For the **CIFAR-10 dataset**, the citation is:
> A. Krizhevsky, G. Hinton, et al. "Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images." 2009.

With these citations in hand, I will compile the dataset information, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for review or further processing, ensuring that all necessary details are included for each dataset extracted from the paper.
