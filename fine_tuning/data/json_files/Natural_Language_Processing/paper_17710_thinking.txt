To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Scaffolding fundamentals and recent advances in sustainable scaffolding techniques for cultured meat development" by AMM Nurul Alam et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their full citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a general overview, but I will focus on sections that typically contain specific dataset references.

Next, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets in the **results and discussion sections**. These sections often detail the experiments conducted and the datasets used for analysis. I will pay attention to any tables or figures that may summarize data or datasets.

In this paper, I will specifically look for references to any datasets related to the scaffolding techniques or cultured meat production. For instance, if the authors mention specific experiments conducted using certain materials or methods, I will note those down as potential datasets.

I will also check the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned in the text. This is crucial as it provides the necessary context and source for the datasets.

For example, if the authors refer to a dataset derived from a specific study on edible scaffolds or a particular bioprinting technique, I will locate the original source in the references and extract the full citation.

Once I have identified the datasets and their corresponding citations, I will compile this information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation.

In summary, my steps will be:
1. Read the abstract, introduction, and methods sections for mentions of datasets.
2. Examine results and discussion sections for specific datasets used in experiments.
3. Identify any tables or figures summarizing data.
4. Check the references section for full citations of any datasets mentioned.
5. Compile the identified datasets and their citations into a structured format for clarity and future reference.
