To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Exploring the Influence of Driving Context on Lateral Driving Style Preferences: A Simulator-Based Study" by Johann Haselberger et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the study includes a dataset that is publicly accessible, which is a good starting point.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **results** sections. In this paper, the authors mention that they conducted a controlled study and made the dataset publicly available, which suggests that there is a specific dataset related to their experiments.

Upon reviewing the text, I find that the authors provide a link to the dataset: "the gathered dataset is openly accessible at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jhaselberger/idcld-subject-study-on-driving-style-preferences." This indicates that the dataset is hosted on Kaggle, which is a well-known platform for sharing datasets.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the dataset. However, since the dataset is hosted on Kaggle and does not have a traditional citation format like a journal article, I will note the dataset's title and the URL as the citation.

The dataset is titled "IDCLD: Subject Study on Driving Style Preferences," and the citation will be formatted as follows:
> Haselberger, J., Böhle, M., Schick, B., & Müller, S. (2024). *IDCLD: Subject Study on Driving Style Preferences*. Retrieved from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jhaselberger/idcld-subject-study-on-driving-style-preferences.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that highlights the dataset's title, description, and citation, ensuring that it is clear and accessible for future reference or analysis.
