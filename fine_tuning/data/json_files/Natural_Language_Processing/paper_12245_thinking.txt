To extract datasets from the research paper titled "National Origin Discrimination in Deep-Learning-Powered Automated Resume Screening" by Sihang Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on AI in hiring and mentions the use of real candidate resumes for experiments, which suggests that there are datasets involved.

Next, I will examine **section 4 (Experimental Study)**, where the authors describe their experiments. In **subsection 4.1 (Dataset and Pre-processing)**, the authors specify that they collected two types of datasets: **resumes** and **job postings**. They mention using a public resume dataset that consists of over 1,000 profiles in PDF or DOCX format, which is crucial for understanding the data used in their experiments.

The authors also detail the demographic distribution of the resumes, indicating that they selected 129 resumes from three demographic groups: 64 from China, 31 from India, and 34 from Malaysia. This information is essential for documenting the dataset's characteristics.

For the job postings, the authors state that they collected postings from popular job sites like Indeed.com, specifically targeting three common types of roles: Management, Analytic, and Accounting. This indicates that the job postings dataset is also relevant to their study.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The authors reference a public resume dataset available on GitHub, which is important for proper citation. The specific link provided is:
> JAIJANYANI. *Automated Resume Screening System*. GitHub repository. Available at: https://github.com/JAIJANYANI/Automated-Resume-Screening-System.

Since the job postings are collected from Indeed.com, I will note that while they do not provide a specific citation for the job postings dataset, it is common practice to reference the source of the data collection.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
