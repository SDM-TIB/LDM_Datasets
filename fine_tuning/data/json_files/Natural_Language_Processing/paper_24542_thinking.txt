To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Is ChatGPT a Better Explainer than My Professor?": Evaluating the Explanation Capabilities of LLMs in Conversation Compared to a Human Baseline by Milad Alshomary et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the **5-Levels dataset**, which is a strong indication that this is a key dataset used in the research.

Next, I will look closely at **section 1 (Introduction)**, where the authors reference the **5-Levels dataset** constructed from the WIRED YouTube series by Wachsmuth et al., and later annotated by Booshehri et al. This section provides context about the dataset's purpose and its relevance to the study.

In **section 2 (Methods)**, the authors provide more details about the **5-Levels dataset**, explaining that it contains conversations between an expert and five different people at varying levels of proficiency. This section confirms the dataset's structure and its application in the study.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The relevant citations are:

- For the **5-Levels dataset**, the citation is:
  > Henning Wachsmuth and Milad Alshomary. 2022. "Mama Always Had a Way of Explaining Things So I Could Understand”: A Dialogue Corpus for Learning to Construct Explanations. arXiv preprint arXiv:2209.02508 (2022).

- For the annotations by Booshehri et al., the citation is:
  > Henning Wachsmuth, Milad Alshomary, and others. 2023. "Explanatory Acts: A Framework for Understanding Explanation Conversations." arXiv preprint arXiv:2309.16804 (2023).

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use.

In summary, the key dataset extracted from the paper is the **5-Levels dataset**, and I have noted its full citation along with the relevant annotations. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the necessary details for any future processing or documentation.
