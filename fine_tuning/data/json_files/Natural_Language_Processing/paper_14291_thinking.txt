To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Learning-based Analysis of Basins of Attraction" by David Valle et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for analyzing basins of attraction in dynamical systems, which suggests that datasets related to these systems may be included.

Next, I will focus on **section II (Complex Dynamical Systems and Their Characterization Metrics)**, where the authors describe the dynamical systems used for analysis. They mention several systems, including the **Dufﬁng oscillator**, **forced damped pendulum**, **Newton fractal**, **Hénon-Heiles system**, and **magnetic pendulum**. Each of these systems is associated with a specific number of basins of attraction, which indicates that datasets are being utilized.

In **section III (Convolutional Neural Networks and Their Training)**, the authors detail how they trained CNNs using images of the basins of attraction. They specify the number of images generated for each system, which provides concrete data about the datasets:

1. **Dufﬁng oscillator**: 84,842 images.
2. **Forced damped pendulum**: 18,926 images.
3. **Hénon-Heiles system**: 1,230 exit basins.
4. **Newton fractal**: 14,276 basins.
5. **Magnetic pendulum**: 14,384 basins.

Next, I will check the **Appendix A** for any additional details about the datasets, including how they were computed and the parameters used. This section confirms the number of basins for each system and provides context for their generation.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets. The paper does not provide specific citations for the datasets themselves, but it references several foundational papers related to the dynamical systems and methods used. I will note these references as they may serve as authoritative sources for the datasets:

- For the **Dufﬁng oscillator** and **forced damped pendulum**, the authors reference:
  > Datseris, G. and Wagemakers, A. "Effortless estimation of basins of attraction," Chaos 32, 023104 (2022).

- For the **Hénon-Heiles system**, the citation is:
  > Hénon, M. and Heiles, C. "The applicability of the third integral of motion: Some numerical experiments," The Astron. J. 69, 73 (1964).

- For the **Newton fractal**, the authors reference:
  > Nusse, H. and Yorke, J. "Basins of attraction," Science 271, 1376–1380 (1996).

- For the **magnetic pendulum**, the citation is:

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its corresponding citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
