To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Good Questions Help Zero-Shot Image Reasoning" by Kaiwen Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the datasets used in the research. The abstract mentions evaluations on various zero-shot vision-language benchmarks, which suggests that specific datasets are involved.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors explicitly list the datasets used for evaluation in section 4 (Experiments). Here, they mention five datasets across three categories of reasoning tasks: 

1. **ScienceQA**: A multimodal benchmark containing multiple-choice questions across a range of scientific subjects, specifically using samples from the test set that are accompanied by images.

2. **Flowers102**: A dataset that includes 120 flower categories with a total of 8,189 images, where each class has between 40 to 258 images.

3. **Oxford-IIIT Pet**: This dataset comprises 37 categories, including 25 dog breeds and 12 cat breeds, with a total of 7,349 images.

4. **FGVC Aircraft**: A dataset containing 10,200 images of aircraft, with 100 images for each of 102 different aircraft model variants.

5. **SNLI-VE**: A visual entailment dataset that extends the text entailment task into the visual domain, asking whether the image is semantically entailed, neutral, or contradicted by a given hypothesis.

After identifying these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- **ScienceQA**:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference and further processing.
