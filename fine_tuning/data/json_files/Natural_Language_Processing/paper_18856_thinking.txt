To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Improving Agent Interactions in Virtual Environments with Language Models" by Jack Zhang, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions using the **Minecraft dataset** for a collaborative building assignment, which indicates that a dataset is involved. This is a good starting point.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section more closely. Here, the author discusses previous attempts to create an automatic building helper in Minecraft, which suggests that the Minecraft dataset is central to the research. However, I need to confirm the specific datasets used in the experiments.

In the **experiments section**, the author explicitly states that they utilized the **collaborative building datasets** from previous works, specifically citing two papers: **Jayannavar et al. (2020)** and **Shi et al. (2022a)**. This indicates that these papers likely describe the datasets used in the experiments.

Now, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **collaborative building dataset** introduced by Jayannavar et al. (2020), the citation is:
   > Prashant Jayannavar, Anjali Narayan-Chen, and Julia Hockenmaier. *Learning to execute instructions in a Minecraft dialogue*. In Proceedings of the 58th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, 2020.

2. For the **LearnToAsk model** dataset referenced by Shi et al. (2022a), the citation is:
   > Zhengxiang Shi, Yue Feng, and Aldo Lipani. *Learning to execute actions or ask clarification questions*. In Findings of the Association for Computational Linguistics: NAACL 2022, pages 2060â€“2070, Seattle, United States. Association for Computational Linguistics.

With these citations in hand, I can now summarize the datasets:

- **Minecraft Dataset**: This dataset is used for collaborative building tasks in the Minecraft environment, focusing on how AI can follow instructions and interact with users effectively.

- **Collaborative Building Dataset**: This dataset is specifically designed for training models to execute instructions in a Minecraft dialogue context.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its full citation, ready for further processing or review.
