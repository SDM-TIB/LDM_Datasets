To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Advancing Data-Driven Weather Forecasting: Time-Sliding Data Augmentation of ERA5" by Minjong Cheon et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the datasets referenced. The abstract mentions the use of the **ECMWF Reanalysis v5 (ERA5)** dataset, which is a significant indicator that this dataset is central to the research.

Next, I will focus on the **Materials and Methods** section, specifically **section 2.1 (Data Description)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset. Here, they describe the **ERA5 dataset**, which includes comprehensive global atmospheric fields and consists of 66 variables at a 2.5-degree horizontal resolution. The authors also specify the temporal snapshots and the training, validation, and testing sets used in their experiments.

In addition to the ERA5 dataset, the authors introduce a novel approach involving **lagged data** for data augmentation, which effectively increases the sample size for training. This method is crucial for understanding how the authors expanded their dataset for better predictive performance.

I will also check the **References section** to ensure I can provide full citations for the datasets mentioned. The relevant citation for the **ERA5 dataset** is:

- **ERA5 Dataset**:
  > Hersbach, H., et al. (2020). The ERA5 global reanalysis. *Quarterly Journal of the Royal Meteorological Society*, 146(730), 1999â€“2049. doi:10.1002/qj.3803.

While the authors discuss the use of lagged data, they do not provide a separate citation for this augmentation method, as it is derived from the original ERA5 dataset.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citation for the ERA5 dataset as required. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
