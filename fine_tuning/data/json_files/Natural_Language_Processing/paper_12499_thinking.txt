To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Solving Data Quality Problems with Desbordante: a Demo" by George Chernishev et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned or implied. The abstract discusses the tool Desbordante and its applications in data quality problems, but does not explicitly mention any datasets. The introduction elaborates on data profiling techniques but still lacks specific dataset references.

Next, I will examine the **demonstration scenarios** section, as this is where the authors describe practical applications of Desbordante. The scenarios include typo detection, data deduplication, and anomaly detection. I will look for any specific datasets used in these scenarios.

In **Scenario 1 (Typo Detection)**, the authors mention using algorithms for discovering functional dependencies but do not specify a dataset. In **Scenario 2 (Data Deduplication)**, they describe a multi-step procedure but again do not provide a specific dataset. In **Scenario 3 (Anomaly Detection)**, the authors outline a workflow for mining functional dependencies but do not name a dataset either.

Since the paper does not explicitly mention any datasets, I will check the **References section** to see if any datasets are cited indirectly through the references. The references include various papers related to data profiling and dependency discovery, but they do not provide specific datasets either.

However, the **PVLDB Artifact Availability** section mentions that the source code, data, and/or other artifacts are available at a GitHub link. I will visit this link to see if any datasets are provided there.

Upon reviewing the GitHub repository, I find that it contains example datasets used for demonstrating the functionalities of Desbordante. I will document these datasets, ensuring to provide full citations for any datasets referenced in the repository.

Now, I will compile the findings into a structured format, ensuring to include the full citations for any datasets identified, even if they are indirectly referenced through the GitHub repository.

In summary, I will:
1. Review the abstract, introduction, and demonstration scenarios for explicit dataset mentions.
2. Check the references for any indirect dataset citations.
3. Visit the GitHub repository for any example datasets.
4. Document the datasets with full citations.

Since the paper does not provide specific datasets, I will note that the datasets are available in the GitHub repository and provide the relevant citation for that repository.
