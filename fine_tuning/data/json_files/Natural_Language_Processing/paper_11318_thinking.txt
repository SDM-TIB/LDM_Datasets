To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Far-reaching effects of bombing on fertility in mid-20th century Japan" by Tatsuki Inoue and Erika Igarashi, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study uses **town/village data from 1935 and 1947** along with **city air raid damage information**. This suggests that there are specific datasets related to demographic and historical data.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, where the authors describe their data sources in detail. They mention that their dataset includes **town- and village-level crude birth rates** and **air raid damage information**. This is a clear indication of the datasets being utilized.

In the **data section**, the authors specify that they compiled **panel data for the Kinki region** covering **1,437 towns and villages**. They also mention the use of **population censuses** and **reports of air raid damage** from the **Economic Stabilization Board**. This provides a clearer picture of the datasets involved.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The key datasets identified are:

1. **Town/Village Data (1935 and 1947)**: This dataset includes demographic information such as crude birth rates.
   - Citation: Statistics Bureau of the Cabinet. (1938). *Shichōsonbetsu jinkōdōtaikei (The vital statistics for municipalities, 1935 edition)*. Tokyo: Statistics Bureau of the Cabinet.

2. **Air Raid Damage Information**: This dataset includes reports on the extent of damage caused by air raids during WWII.
   - Citation: Economic Stabilization Board. (1949). *Taiheiyō sensō ni yoru wagakuni no higai sōgō hōkokusho (Comprehensive Report on the Damage Caused by the Pacific War in Japan)*. Tokyo: Economic Stabilization Board.

3. **Population Census Data**: This dataset provides population statistics for the years 1935 and 1947.
   - Citation: Statistics Bureau of the Cabinet. (1948). *Shōwanijūnen Rinji Kokuseichōsahōkoku, fukenhen (1947 Population Census of Japan, prefecture part)*. Tokyo: Statistics Bureau of the Cabinet.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that highlights the key aspects of each dataset, including their citations, to ensure proper attribution and clarity for future reference. This will facilitate further analysis or integration into other research efforts.
