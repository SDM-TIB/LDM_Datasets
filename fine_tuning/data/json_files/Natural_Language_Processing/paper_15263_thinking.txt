To extract datasets from the research paper titled "PROMPTCBLUE: A Chinese Prompt Tuning Benchmark for the Medical Domain" by Wei Zhu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are mentioned. The abstract highlights the creation of the **PromptCBLUE benchmark**, which suggests that it is a significant dataset for evaluating Chinese LLMs in the medical domain.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **methodology and results sections**. In the paper, the authors describe various tasks and datasets that are part of the PromptCBLUE benchmark. I will pay close attention to sections that detail the tasks, as they often include the names of the datasets used.

In the **section 3.2 (Overview of PromptCBLUE)**, the authors list several tasks and their corresponding datasets, including:

1. **CMeEE-V2**: A medical named entity recognition task.
2. **CMeIE**: A medical triple extraction task.
3. **CHIP-CDEE**: A task for extracting clinical finding events.
4. **CHIP-CDN**: A task for mapping diagnosis descriptions to standardized ICD-10 disease terms.
5. **IMCS-V2-NER**: A task for extracting medical entities from dialogues.

Each of these tasks is associated with specific datasets that are crucial for the evaluation of LLMs in the medical domain.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. The citations are essential for proper attribution and to guide readers to the original sources. For example, the authors reference the original CBLUE benchmark, which is foundational for the PromptCBLUE benchmark.

The citations I will need to extract include:

- For **CMeEE-V2**, I will look for the original paper that introduced this dataset.
- For **CMeIE**, I will find the corresponding citation.
- For **CHIP-CDEE**, **CHIP-CDN**, and others, I will do the same.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the datasets along with their full citations into a structured format. This will ensure that the datasets are clearly identified and properly credited.

Finally, I will summarize the findings in a clear and concise manner, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its citation, ready for further processing or review.
