To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Nonnegative Matrix Factorization with Beta Divergences" by Valentin Leplat et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions applications of deep NMF in facial feature extraction, topic modeling, and hyperspectral imaging, which suggests that datasets related to these applications may be discussed.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, I will look for specific mentions of datasets, including their names, characteristics, and any relevant details about how they were used in the experiments.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find the following datasets mentioned:

1. **CBCL Face Dataset**: This dataset is used for facial feature extraction and contains 2429 faces, each with dimensions of 19x19 pixels. The authors reference the seminal work by Lee and Seung that introduced NMF to the machine learning community.

2. **TDT2-top30 Dataset**: This dataset is utilized for topic modeling and consists of 9394 documents collected from various news sources in 1998. The authors mention that they focus on the largest 30 categories from this corpus.

3. **AVIRIS Moffett Field Dataset**: This hyperspectral imaging dataset was acquired by the JPL spectro-imager AVIRIS and consists of 512x614 pixels and 224 spectral reflectance bands. The authors extract a 50x50 sub-image for their analysis.

4. **Tumor Dataset**: This dataset corresponds to a simulated Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopic Imaging (MRSI) of a glioma patient brain, containing 519 spectral bands with dimensions of 13x11 pixels.

5. **Samson Dataset**: This dataset comprises 156 spectral bands and has a resolution of 95x95 pixels, containing various materials such as soil, trees, and water.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. The citations may not always be explicitly provided for datasets, but I will look for the original papers or sources that describe these datasets.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or processing.
