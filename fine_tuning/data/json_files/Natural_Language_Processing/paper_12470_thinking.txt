To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Pilot Performance modeling via observer-based inverse reinforcement learning" by Jared Town, Zachary Morrison, and Rushikesh Kamalapurkar, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, which may hint at the datasets used for experiments.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. This section typically contains detailed descriptions of the experimental setup, including any datasets used for training or evaluation. I will pay attention to any figures, tables, or references that might indicate the presence of datasets.

In this paper, the authors describe the experimental setup involving a quadcopter and mention that the pilot behavior modeling problem is reformulated as an inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) problem. However, they do not explicitly mention any publicly available datasets. Instead, they describe the data collection process involving a custom-built quadcopter and the use of a motion capture system for state estimation.

Since the paper does not provide specific dataset names or references, I will note that the data used in the experiments is collected from the quadcopter's flight trials, which are not publicly available datasets but rather experimental data generated by the authors.

Next, I will check the **References section** to see if any cited works refer to datasets or methodologies that could be relevant. However, it appears that the references primarily consist of previous research papers and methodologies rather than specific datasets.

In conclusion, while the paper discusses the experimental setup and data collection methods, it does not provide explicit names or citations for any datasets. Therefore, I will summarize the findings as follows:

1. **Experimental Data from Quadcopter Trials**: The data used in the experiments is collected from a custom-built quadcopter using a motion capture system. This data is not publicly available and is specific to the experiments conducted by the authors.

Since no formal datasets are cited in the paper, I will not be able to provide full citations for datasets as they do not exist in this context. Instead, I will document the experimental data collection process as described by the authors.
