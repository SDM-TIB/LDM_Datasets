To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Density of States Prediction of Crystalline Materials via Prompt-guided Multi-Modal Transformer" by Namkyeong Lee et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on two types of density of states (DOS), specifically Phonon DOS and Electron DOS, which suggests that these datasets are central to their research.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 5) where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, they state that they used the **Phonon DOS dataset** and the **Electron DOS dataset** for their experiments. This confirms that these are the two datasets I need to extract.

In **Appendix A**, the authors provide detailed descriptions of both datasets:

1. **Phonon DOS Dataset**: This dataset contains 1,522 crystalline materials whose phonon DOS is calculated from density functional perturbation theory (DFPT). The authors mention that the dataset is available through a GitHub repository associated with a previous work.

2. **Electron DOS Dataset**: This dataset consists of 38,889 crystalline materials and their electron DOS information collected from the Materials Project (MP) website. The authors also describe the preprocessing steps taken, such as excluding materials with magnetism and normalizing the DOS values.

Now, I will look for the full citations for these datasets in the **References section** of the paper. The citations are as follows:

- For the **Phonon DOS dataset**, the citation is:
  > Chen, Z., Andrejevic, N., Smidt, T., Ding, Z., Xu, Q., Chi, Y.-T., Nguyen, Q. T., Alatas, A., Kong, J., and Li, M. *Direct prediction of phonon density of states with Euclidean neural networks*. Advanced Science, 8(12):2004214, 2021.

- For the **Electron DOS dataset**, the citation is:
  > Materials Project. *Materials Project Database*. Available at: https://materialsproject.org/.

With this information, I can now compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details regarding the datasets used in the research.
