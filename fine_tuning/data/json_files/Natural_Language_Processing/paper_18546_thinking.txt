To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Uncertain Positive Learning for Cloud Failure Prediction" by Haozhe Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors used "two real-world datasets of disk failure prediction" and "conducting node prediction experiments in Microsoft Azure." This suggests that there are at least two datasets that I need to find.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In the introduction, the authors mention using "two public disk datasets, Alibaba and Backblaze," which are likely the datasets referenced in the abstract.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide more details about these datasets. They describe the **Alibaba Cloud dataset** as being collected from large-scale data centers and published for a competition, containing millions of disks over a period of more than 16 months. The **Backblaze dataset** is described as a public dataset based on hard drives in the Backblaze data center, containing over 90,000 disks.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and further exploration of the datasets.

1. For the **Alibaba Cloud dataset**, the citation is:
   > Tianchi: Data Sets. 2022. Large-scale Disk Failure Prediction Dataset. https://tianchi.aliyun.com/dataset/dataDetail?dataId=70251.

2. For the **Backblaze dataset**, the citation is:
   > Backblaze. 2022. The Backblaze Hard Drive Data and Stats. https://www.backblaze.com/b2/hard-drive-test-data.html.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for any further processing or review.
