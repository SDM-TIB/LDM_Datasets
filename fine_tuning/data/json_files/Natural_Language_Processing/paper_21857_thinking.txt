To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Mapping Wireless Networks into Digital Reality through Joint Vertical and Horizontal Learning" by Zifan Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their full citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and evaluation sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of "real-world wireless traffic data within a cellular wireless network," which indicates that a dataset is involved. I will look for specific mentions of datasets in these sections.

Next, I will focus on the **evaluation section** where the authors describe their experiments. In this section, they state that they employed a dataset provided by Telecom Italia, specifically from Milan City, which is composed of wireless traffic data divided into 10,000 grid cells. This is a clear identification of a dataset.

I will also note the details provided about the dataset, such as its structure (10,000 grid cells, each with its own base station) and the types of data it includes (SMS, call activities, and internet usage patterns). This information is crucial for a comprehensive description of the dataset.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset mentioned. The paper cites the dataset as follows:

- For the dataset from Telecom Italia, the citation is:
  > Barlacchi, Gianni, M. D. Nadai, R. Larcher, A. Casella, C. Chitic, G. Torrisi, F. Antonelli, A. Vespignani, A. Pentland, and B. Lepri. "A multi-source dataset of urban life in the city of Milan and the province of Trentino." In Sci. Data 2, 2015.

With this information, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring to include the dataset name, description, and full citation.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry in the required format, ensuring that all details are accurately represented for future reference or processing.
