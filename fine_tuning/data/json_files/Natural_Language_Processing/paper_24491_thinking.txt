To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Light-weight End-to-End Graph Interest Network for CTR Prediction in E-commerce Search" by Yunqing Jia et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on both public and industrial datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, as this section typically contains detailed information about the datasets used. In **subsection 4.1 (Datasets)**, the authors explicitly list two datasets:

1. **Taobao Dataset**: This dataset is described as a collection of user behaviors from Taobao’s recommender system, containing four types of user behaviors (click, purchase, adding to cart, and adding to wishlist). The dataset specifically uses click behaviors sorted by time to construct behavior sequences.

2. **Industrial Dataset**: This dataset is collected from the authors' online search system, which is one of the largest e-commerce platforms. It includes user historical click sequences and search query sequences, along with other features, and is structured for predicting whether a user will click on a given item.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The paper does not provide specific citations for the datasets, but it does mention that the Taobao dataset can be found at a URL (https://tianchi.aliyun.com/dataset/649). I will note this as the citation for the Taobao dataset.

For the **Industrial Dataset**, since it is proprietary and collected from the authors' own system, it may not have a formal citation. However, I will mention it as an industrial dataset used in their experiments.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

- **Taobao Dataset**: A collection of user behaviors from Taobao’s recommender system, available at: 
  > Han Zhu, Xiang Li, Pengye Zhang, Guozheng Li, Jie He, Han Li, and Kun Gai. *Learning Tree-based Deep Model for Recommender Systems*. In Proceedings of the 24th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery & Data Mining, 2018. Available at: https://tianchi.aliyun.com/dataset/649

- **Industrial Dataset**: Collected from the authors' online search system, details not formally cited.

Now, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
