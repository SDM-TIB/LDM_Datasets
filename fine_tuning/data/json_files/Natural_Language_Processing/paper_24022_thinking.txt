To extract datasets from the research paper titled "VELOCITI: Can Video-Language Models Bind Semantic Concepts through Time?" by Darshana Saravanan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract introduces VELOCITI as a benchmark based on complex movie clips and dense semantic role label annotations, indicating that there are datasets involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors discuss the need for a benchmark to evaluate video-language models. They mention using **VidSitu**, which is a video situation recognition dataset, as a foundational dataset for their benchmark. This is a strong indication that VidSitu is a key dataset.

In the **methodology section**, particularly where they describe the VELOCITI benchmark, the authors elaborate on how they utilize the VidSitu dataset. They explain that VidSitu consists of dense annotations with semantic role labels (SRLs) sourced from movie clips. This confirms that VidSitu is indeed the primary dataset used in their experiments.

I will then check the **references section** to find the full citation for the VidSitu dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:

- For **VidSitu Dataset**:
  > Arka Sadhu, Tanmay Gupta, Mark Yatskar, Ram Nevatia, and Aniruddha Kembhavi. *Visual Semantic Role Labeling for Video Understanding*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 5589â€“5600, 2021.

Since VidSitu is the only dataset explicitly mentioned in the paper, I will compile this information into a structured format.

Finally, I will ensure that I have accurately captured the dataset name, description, and citation, ready for any further processing or review.
