To extract datasets from the research paper titled "BPE and CharCNNs for Translation of Morphology: A Cross-Lingual Comparison and Analysis" by Pamela Shapiro and Kevin Duh, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors translate from 8 languages into English using a multi-way parallel collection of TED transcripts, which suggests that there is a dataset involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experiments)**, where the authors provide details about the dataset used. They mention that they selected 8 different source languages based on typological diversity from a multi-way parallel collection of TED talk transcripts. The statistics for the training data for each language are presented in Table 1, which includes the number of tokens, types, and sentences for each language.

The languages mentioned in the dataset are:
- Arabic (ar)
- French (fr)
- German (de)
- Hebrew (he)
- Hungarian (hu)
- Portuguese (pt)
- Romanian (ro)
- Russian (ru)

The paper also provides a link to the dataset: http://www.cs.jhu.edu/Ëœkevinduh/a/multitarget-tedtalks/.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the TED Talks dataset. However, the paper does not provide a specific citation for the TED dataset itself, but it does reference the source of the dataset in the text.

Since the dataset is a multi-way parallel collection of TED transcripts, I will note that the citation for the TED Talks dataset is generally attributed to the TED conference and can be referenced as follows:

- TED Talks Dataset:
  > TED Conferences LLC. *TED Talks: Ideas worth spreading*. Available at: http://www.ted.com/talks.

Now, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format, ensuring to include the full citation for the TED Talks dataset as it is crucial for proper attribution.

In summary, I have identified the dataset used in the paper, noted the languages involved, and found the appropriate citation for the TED Talks dataset. I will now prepare the dataset entries for output.
