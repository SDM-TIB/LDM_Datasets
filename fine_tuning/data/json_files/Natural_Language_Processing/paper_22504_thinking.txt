To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CAGES: Cost-Aware Gradient Entropy Search for Efficient Local Multi-Fidelity Bayesian Optimization" by Wei-Ting Tang and Joel A. Paulson, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned or referenced. The abstract discusses the application of the proposed method on various synthetic and benchmark reinforcement learning problems, which suggests that datasets may be involved.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section IV) closely, as this is typically where datasets used for testing and validation are described. In this section, the authors mention three specific problems: the Rosenbrock benchmark, the OTL circuit problem, and the Cartpole-v1 reinforcement learning problem. I will look for any explicit references to datasets or sources of data for these problems.

1. **Rosenbrock Benchmark**: The authors describe a six-dimensional version of the Rosenbrock function, which is a well-known optimization benchmark. However, they do not cite a specific dataset for this function, as it is a mathematical function rather than a dataset.

2. **OTL Circuit Problem**: The authors refer to the OTL circuit function and mention that the exact function is defined in a specific reference. I will need to check the reference list to find the full citation for this function.

3. **Cartpole-v1**: The authors mention using the OpenAI Gym environment for the Cartpole-v1 problem. This is a widely recognized benchmark in reinforcement learning, and I will need to provide the citation for the OpenAI Gym.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to gather the full citations for the relevant datasets or functions:

- For the **OTL circuit problem**, the citation is:
  > E. N. Ben-Ari and D. M. Steinberg, “Modeling data from computer experiments: an empirical comparison of kriging with MARS and projection pursuit regression,” *Quality Engineering*, vol. 19, no. 4, pp. 327–338, 2007.

- For the **OpenAI Gym**, the citation is:
  > G. Brockman, V. Cheung, L. Pettersson, J. Schneider, J. Schulman, J. Tang, and W. Zaremba, “OpenAI Gym,” arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01540, 2016.

Since the Rosenbrock function does not have a specific dataset citation, I will note that it is a mathematical function commonly used in optimization literature.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the full citation as required. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets referenced in the paper.
