To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Resilient Multiple Choice Learning: A learned scoring scheme with application to audio scene analysis" by Victor Letzelter et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors validate their method on the sound source localization task, which suggests that datasets related to audio scene analysis may be involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention two datasets:

1. **ANSYN Dataset**: This dataset is derived from the DCASE 2016 Sound Event Detection challenge and contains spatially localized events in anechoic conditions. It is divided into three sub-datasets based on the maximum number of overlapping events.

2. **RESYN Dataset**: This is a variant of the ANSYN dataset but is designed for reverberant conditions. Similar to ANSYN, it is also divided into three sub-datasets based on the number of overlapping events.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **ANSYN Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Sharath Adavanne, Archontis Politis, Joonas Nikunen, and Tuomas Virtanen. *Sound event localization and detection of overlapping sources using convolutional recurrent neural networks*. IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing, 13(1):34–48, 2018.

- For the **RESYN Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Sharath Adavanne, Archontis Politis, and Tuomas Virtanen. *Direction of arrival estimation for multiple sound sources using convolutional recurrent neural network*. In 2018 26th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO), pages 1462–1466. IEEE, 2018.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
