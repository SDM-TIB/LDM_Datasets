To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Statutory Article Retrieval Dataset in French" by Antoine Louis and Gerasimos Spanakis, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract introduces the **Belgian Statutory Article Retrieval Dataset (BSARD)**, which consists of over 1,100 legal questions labeled by jurists with references to relevant articles from a corpus of 22,600 Belgian law articles. This indicates that the dataset is significant and central to the paper's contributions.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets**. In this paper, the dataset is described in **section 3 (The Belgian Statutory Article Retrieval Dataset)**. Here, the authors provide detailed information about the dataset's creation, including the number of questions, the corpus of law articles, and the process of annotation. 

The key dataset identified is:

1. **Belgian Statutory Article Retrieval Dataset (BSARD)**: This dataset contains 1,108 legal questions posed by Belgian citizens, annotated with references to relevant articles from a corpus of 22,633 Belgian law articles. The dataset is publicly available and can be accessed via the provided GitHub link.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The authors mention that the dataset and source code are publicly available at:
- GitHub: https://github.com/maastrichtlawtech/bsard
- Zenodo: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5217310

The citation for the dataset is:
> Antoine Louis and Gerasimos Spanakis. *A Statutory Article Retrieval Dataset in French*. Law & Tech Lab, Maastricht University. Available at: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5217310.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, ensuring that I include the full citation as required. This process will help ensure that I accurately represent the dataset and its significance in the context of the research paper.
