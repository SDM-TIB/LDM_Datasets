To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Adaptive Prototypical Pseudo-Labeling for Few-shot OOD Detection" by Pei Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract highlights the focus on few-shot OOD detection and mentions using "two commonly used OOD intent detection datasets," which indicates that specific datasets will be discussed later in the paper.

Next, I will look into the **methodology** section, particularly the **experiments** subsection, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this paper, the authors mention evaluating their method on two datasets: **Banking** and **Stackoverflow**. I will note down these names as they are crucial for the dataset extraction.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide details about how they constructed their datasets. They explain that they randomly sampled intents from the original datasets, which is important for understanding the context of the datasets used. I will ensure to capture this information as it may be relevant for future reference.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

1. **Banking Dataset**:
   > Iñigo Casanueva, Tadas Temčina, Daniela Gerz, Matthew Henderson, and Ivan Vulić. *Efficient intent detection with dual sentence encoders*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2003.04807, 2020.

2. **Stackoverflow Dataset**:
   > Jiaming Xu, Peng Wang, Guanhua Tian, Bo Xu, Jun Zhao, Fangyuan Wang, and Hongwei Hao. *Short text clustering via convolutional neural networks*. In Proceedings of the 1st Workshop on Vector Space Modeling for Natural Language Processing, pages 62–69, 2015.

Having gathered the dataset names and their citations, I will now compile this information into a structured format for clarity and future use.

In summary, the datasets extracted from the paper are:
- **Banking Dataset** with citation: 
  > Iñigo Casanueva, Tadas Temčina, Daniela Gerz, Matthew Henderson, and Ivan Vulić. *Efficient intent detection with dual sentence encoders*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2003.04807, 2020.

- **Stackoverflow Dataset** with citation:
  > Jiaming Xu, Peng Wang, Guanhua Tian, Bo Xu, Jun Zhao, Fangyuan Wang, and Hongwei Hao. *Short text clustering via convolutional neural networks*. In Proceedings of the 1st Workshop on Vector Space Modeling for Natural Language Processing, pages 62–69, 2015.

This structured approach ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the research paper.
