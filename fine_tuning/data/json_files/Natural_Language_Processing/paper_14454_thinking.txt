To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Skip-Plan: Procedure Planning in Instructional Videos via Condensed Action Space Learning" by Zhiheng Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors achieved state-of-the-art performance on the **CrossTask** and **COIN** benchmarks, indicating that these are likely datasets used in their experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4), where the authors provide detailed information about the datasets. In **section 4.1 (Evaluation Protocols)**, they explicitly state that they evaluated their model on two real-world instructional video datasets: 

1. **CrossTask**: This dataset contains 2,763 videos with a total duration of 213 hours, consisting of 18 different tasks with an average of 7.4 steps per task.

2. **COIN**: This dataset spans 12 different domains related to daily life, containing 11,827 videos with an average of 3.9 steps per video. It is noted for its diversity in tasks and action labels, featuring 180 tasks and 779 action labels.

To ensure I have the correct citations, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **CrossTask**, the citation is:
  > Dimitri Zhukov, Jean-Baptiste Alayrac, Ramazan Gokberk Cinbis, David Fouhey, Ivan Laptev, and Josef Sivic. *Cross-task weakly supervised learning from instructional videos*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 3537–3545, 2019.

- For **COIN**, the citation is:
  > Yansong Tang, Dajun Ding, Yongming Rao, Yu Zheng, Danyang Zhang, Lili Zhao, Jiwen Lu, and Jie Zhou. *COIN: A large-scale dataset for comprehensive instructional video analysis*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 1207–1216, 2019.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or processing. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets referenced in the paper along with their full citations.
