To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Class-Imbalanced Semi-Supervised Learning for Large-Scale Point Cloud Semantic Segmentation via Decoupling Optimization" by Mengtian Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are referenced. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on several benchmark datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, they explicitly list the datasets they evaluated their method on, which are:

1. **S3DIS**: A dataset containing 271 point cloud indoor scenes across 6 areas with 13 classes.
2. **ScanNet-V2**: This dataset includes 1,613 3D indoor scans.
3. **Semantic3D**: A dataset with over 4 billion points covering diverse outdoor urban scenes.
4. **SemanticKITTI**: An outdoor autonomous driving dataset with 19 classes.

I will then look for the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and will be formatted as follows:

- For **S3DIS**, the citation is:
  > Armeni, I., Sener, O., Zamir, A. R., Jiang, H., Brilakis, I., Fischer, M., & Savarese, S. (2016). *3D semantic parsing of large-scale indoor spaces*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR).

- For **ScanNet-V2**, the citation is:
  > Dai, A., Chang, A. X., Savva, M., Halber, M., Funkhouser, T., & NieÃŸner, M. (2017). *ScanNet: Richly-annotated 3D reconstructions of indoor scenes*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR).

- For **Semantic3D**, the citation is:
  > Hackel, T., Savinov, N., Ladicky, L., Wegner, J., Schindler, K., & Pollefeys, M. (2017). *Semantic3D.net: A new large-scale point cloud classification benchmark*. ISPRS.

- For **SemanticKITTI**, the citation is:
  > Behley, J., Garbade, M., Milioto, A., Quenzel, J., Behnke, S., Stachniss, C., & Gall, J. (2019). *SemanticKITTI: A dataset for semantic scene understanding of lidar sequences*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV).

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This structured approach will help in accurately documenting the datasets used in the research paper.
