To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Emergent Inabilities? Inverse Scaling Over the Course of Pretraining" by James A. Michaelov and Benjamin K. Bergen, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted an exploratory study on the performance of language models across various tasks, which suggests that specific datasets may be involved.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly the subsection titled **2.1 Tasks**. Here, the authors list several tasks that were evaluated, which may correspond to specific datasets. The tasks mentioned include:

1. **TRUTHFULQA-MC1**: A multiple-choice variant of the TruthfulQA benchmark.
2. **TRUTHFULQA-MC2**: Another multiple-choice variant of TruthfulQA.
3. **HINDSIGHT NEGLECT**: A few-shot multiple-choice task.
4. **MEMO TRAP**: A task involving writing famous quotes.
5. **PATTERN MATCH SUPPRESSION**: A task testing pattern recognition.
6. **NEQA**: A zero-shot task with negated questions.
7. **REDEFINE**: A task involving redefinitions of expressions.
8. **RESISTING CORRECTION**: A few-shot task with atypical instructions.
9. **REPETITIVE ALGEBRA**: A few-shot task based on algebra questions.
10. **MODUS TOLLENS**: A task testing deductive reasoning.
11. **SIG FIGS**: A task involving significant figures.

I will note that while these tasks are described, the paper does not explicitly mention datasets in the traditional sense (like image or text datasets). Instead, these tasks are likely derived from existing benchmarks or datasets.

Next, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for the benchmarks or datasets associated with these tasks. The authors reference several papers that may provide the necessary citations for the tasks mentioned. For example:

- **TruthfulQA** is cited as:
  > Lin, S., Hilton, S., & Evans, O. (2022). TruthfulQA: Measuring How Models Mimic Human Falsehoods. In Proceedings of the 60th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers), pages 3214–3252, Dublin, Ireland. Association for Computational Linguistics.

- The **Inverse Scaling Prize** tasks are referenced as:
  > McKenzie, I., Lyzhov, A., Parrish, A., Prabhu, A., Mueller, A., Kim, N., Bowman, S., & Perez, E. (2023b). Inverse Scaling: When Bigger Isn’t Better.

After gathering this information, I will compile the datasets (or tasks) along with their full citations into a structured format for clarity.

In summary, I will extract the tasks mentioned in the paper, identify their corresponding citations from the references, and ensure that each task is accurately represented with its full citation for future reference.
