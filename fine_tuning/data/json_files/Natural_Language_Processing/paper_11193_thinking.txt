To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ICDAR 2023 Competition on Structured Text Extraction from Visually-Rich Document Images" by Wenwen Yu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the paper discusses two tracks of a competition, which suggests that datasets are involved. The introduction further elaborates on the competition's purpose and the types of documents involved, hinting at the datasets used.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any relevant subsections. In this paper, the datasets are described in **section 3 (Competition Tasks and Evaluation Protocols)**, where the authors introduce two main datasets: **HUST-CELL** and **Baidu-FEST**.

1. **HUST-CELL**: This dataset is designed for the first track of the competition, focusing on complex entity linking and labeling. It contains over 4,000 documents across 30 categories, with a mix of Chinese and English documents. The dataset is split into a training set of 2,000 images and a test set of 2,000 images, with annotations provided for the training set.

2. **Baidu-FEST**: This dataset is used for the second track, which emphasizes zero-shot and few-shot structured text extraction. It includes about 11 types of synthetic business documents for training and 10 types of real visually-rich document images for testing, with each type providing around 60 images. Each image is annotated with bounding boxes and text information.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. However, the datasets themselves may not have separate citations in the references, as they are part of the competition's organization. Instead, I will summarize the details provided in the paper.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full details of each dataset, including their purpose, content, and any relevant statistics.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for review or further processing, ensuring that I have accurately captured all necessary information about the datasets mentioned in the paper.
