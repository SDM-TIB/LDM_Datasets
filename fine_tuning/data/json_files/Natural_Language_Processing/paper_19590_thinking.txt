To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Neural Rewriting System to Solve Algorithmic Problems" by Flavio Petruzzellis et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the work, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experiments and results)**, which is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets used in the experiments. In this section, the authors mention three types of algorithmic tasks: ListOps, Arithmetic, and Algebra. Each of these tasks corresponds to a specific dataset or method of data generation.

In **subsection 5.1 (Datasets)**, the authors describe the datasets in detail:

1. **ListOps Dataset**: This dataset was introduced by Nangia and Bowman (2018) to evaluate the capacity of neural networks to build parse trees of nested formulas. The authors modified this dataset to generate expressions that comply with their schema.

2. **Arithmetic Dataset**: The authors generated formulas composed of sum, subtraction, and multiplication operations between two integers sampled from the interval [-99, 99]. They also applied modulo 100 to the intermediate results.

3. **Algebra Dataset**: This dataset consists of algebraic formulas involving sums and subtractions between two monomials, with numerical coefficients sampled from [-99, 99]. The authors ensured that all monomials in a formula share the same literal variables.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

- For the **ListOps Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Nangia, N., & Bowman, S. R. (2018). ListOps: A diagnostic dataset for latent tree learning. In Proceedings of the 2018 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics (NAACL-HLT 2018), pages 92â€“99.

- The **Arithmetic Dataset** and **Algebra Dataset** are generated by the authors for the purpose of this study, so they do not have external citations. However, I will note that they are based on standard arithmetic and algebraic operations.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for the ListOps dataset and clearly indicate that the Arithmetic and Algebra datasets are generated by the authors. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant information regarding the datasets used in the research paper.
