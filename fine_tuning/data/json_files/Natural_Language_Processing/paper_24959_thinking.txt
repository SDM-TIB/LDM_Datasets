To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Active Label Refinement for Robust Training of Imbalanced Medical Image Classification Tasks in the Presence of High Label Noise" by Bidur Khanal et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study and may mention the datasets used, while the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the datasets.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges posed by label noise in medical datasets and mention the need for robust classifiers. However, they do not specify any datasets at this point, so I will need to look further.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically **section 3 (Datasets)**, where the authors detail the datasets used in their study. Here, they mention two datasets:

1. **Long-tailed NCT-CRC-HE-100K**: This dataset consists of 100,000 histopathology images for training and 7,180 for testing, with nine classes. The authors explain how they modified the class distribution to create a long-tailed version of the dataset.

2. **ISIC-2019**: This dataset includes 25,331 RGB images, each belonging to one of eight skin disease conditions. The authors describe how they split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **NCT-CRC-HE-100K**, the citation is:
  > Kather, J.N., Krisam, J., Charoentong, P., Luedde, T., Herpel, E., Weis, C.A., Gaiser, T., Marx, A., Valous, N.A., Ferber, D., et al. *Predicting survival from colorectal cancer histology slides using deep learning: A retrospective multicenter study*. PLoS medicine, 2019.

- For **ISIC-2019**, the citation is:
  > Irvin, J., Rajpurkar, P., Ko, M., Yu, Y., Ciurea-Ilcus, S., Chute, C., Marklund, H., Haghgoo, B., Ball, R., Shpanskaya, K., et al. *Chexpert: A large chest radiograph dataset with uncertainty labels and expert comparison*. In Proceedings of the AAAI conference on artificial intelligence, 2019.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This includes ensuring that I have accurately captured the names, descriptions, and full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper.
