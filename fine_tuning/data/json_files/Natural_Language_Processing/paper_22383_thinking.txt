To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Mask-TS Net: Mask Temperature Scaling Uncertainty Calibration for Polyp Segmentation" by Yudian Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on calibration methods for polyp segmentation, but it does not specify any datasets. The introduction may provide more context or specific dataset names.

Next, I will examine **section 4 (Experiment)**, which is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets used in the experiments. In this section, I find a table (Table 1) that lists several datasets along with their respective image counts and usage in the study. The datasets mentioned are:

1. **CVC-ClinicDB**: Used for training, containing 550 images.
2. **Kvasir**: Used for training, containing 900 images.
3. **CVC-ColonDB**: Used for training, containing 380 images.
4. **CVC-300**: Used for validation, containing 60 images.
5. **ETIS-LaribPolypDB**: Used for testing, containing 196 images.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access these datasets.

The citations I find are as follows:

- For **CVC-ClinicDB**:
  > Bernal, J., Sánchez, F.J., Fernández-Esparrach, G., Gil, D., Rodríguez, C., Vilarinho, F. (2015). Wm-dova maps for accurate polyp highlighting in colonoscopy: Validation vs. saliency maps from physicians. *Computerized Medical Imaging and Graphics*, 43, 99–111.

- For **Kvasir**:

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the study, facilitating further research and validation.
