To extract datasets from the research paper titled "AWEQ: Post-Training Quantization with Activation-Weight Equalization for Large Language Models" by Baisong Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets and Benchmarks)**, as this section is likely to contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the experiments. Here, the authors mention four specific datasets:

1. **PIQA (Everyday Physics Questions)**: This dataset assesses large models' ability to understand everyday physics with over 16,000 training question-answer pairs.

2. **HellaSwag (Commonsense Reasoning Dataset)**: This dataset challenges language models with 70,000 multiple-choice questions that test their ability to extract information and summarize it, with a human accuracy benchmark of 95.6%.

3. **WinoGrande (Large-Scale Question Dataset)**: A sizable dataset with 44,000 questions designed to be more extensive and challenging.

4. **ARC-e (Reasoning Challenge Dataset)**: This dataset covers science questions from grades three to nine, with an easy version (i.e., ARC-e) that includes multiple-choice questions.

In this section, the authors also mention that the evaluation metric used for all four tasks is accuracy, which is important for understanding how the datasets are utilized in the experiments.

Next, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and further exploration of the datasets.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **PIQA**, the citation is:
  > Yonatan Bisk, Rowan Zellers, Jianfeng Gao, Yejin Choi, et al. "PIQA: Reasoning about physical commonsense in natural language." In Proceedings of the AAAI conference on artificial intelligence, 2020, vol. 34, pp. 7432–7439.

- For **HellaSwag**, the citation is:
  > Rowan Zellers, Ari Holtzman, Yonatan Bisk, Ali Farhadi, and Yejin Choi. "HellaSwag: Can a machine really finish your sentence?" arXiv preprint arXiv:1905.07830, 2019.

- For **WinoGrande**, the citation is:
  > Keisuke Sakaguchi, Ronan Le Bras, Chandra Bhagavatula, and Yejin Choi. "WinoGrande: An adversarial winograd schema challenge at scale." Communications of the ACM, vol. 64, no. 9, pp. 99–106, 2021.

- For **ARC-e**, the citation is:
  > Peter Clark, Isaac Cowhey, Oren Etzioni, Tushar Khot, Ashish Sabharwal, Carissa Schoenick, and Oyvind Tafjord. "Think you have solved question answering? try arc, the ai2 reasoning challenge." arXiv preprint arXiv:1803.05457, 2018.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
