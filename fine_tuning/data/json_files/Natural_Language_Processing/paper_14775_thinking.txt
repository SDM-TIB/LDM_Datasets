To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Robust Multivariate Detection and Estimation with Fault Frequency Content Information" by Jingwei Dong et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any references to datasets used for validation or experiments.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** in detail, as this is where authors typically describe the datasets they used for their analyses. I will look for specific names of datasets, their characteristics, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

If the datasets are not clearly listed in the experiments section, I will check the **results section** for any mention of datasets used to validate the findings. Authors often refer to datasets when discussing their results, so this section may provide additional insights.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to ensure that the datasets can be accessed by others.

For this paper, I will look for datasets related to fault detection and estimation, particularly those that involve frequency content information. I will document each dataset's name, a brief description, and the full citation.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile it into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly identified with its citation. This will facilitate easy reference and use in future research or applications.

In summary, my steps will be:
1. Read the abstract, introduction, and methodology sections for mentions of datasets.
2. Examine the experiments and results sections for specific dataset details.
3. Check the references section for full citations of the identified datasets.
4. Document each dataset with its name, description, and citation for clarity and future reference.
