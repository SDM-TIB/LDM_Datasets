To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Inverse Scaling: When Bigger Isnâ€™t Better" by Ian R. McKenzie et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors present empirical evidence from **11 datasets** collected during a public contest, which suggests that these datasets are crucial to the paper's findings.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Inverse Scaling Prize Tasks)**, where the authors describe the winning tasks and their corresponding datasets. Each task is associated with a specific dataset, and the authors provide details about the number of examples and the nature of the tasks. I will list these tasks and their datasets as I go through this section.

The tasks mentioned include:

1. **Resisting Correction**: This task tests the ability of language models to repeat text without modification. The dataset consists of 7,344 examples.
2. **Memo Trap**: This task involves generating a quote that ends with a specific word. The dataset contains 936 examples.
3. **Redefine**: This task requires reasoning with redefinitions of symbols. The dataset has 1,244 examples.
4. **Prompt Injection**: This task tests the ability to follow commands while ignoring conflicting instructions. The dataset includes 1,000 examples.
5. **Modus Tollens**: This task evaluates logical reasoning. The dataset consists of 1,236 examples.
6. **Pattern Match Suppression**: This task assesses the ability to violate a repetitive pattern. The dataset has 1,428 examples.
7. **NeQA**: This task involves handling negation in multiple-choice questions. The dataset contains 300 examples.
8. **Sig Figs**: This task tests rounding numbers to significant figures. The dataset has 20,897 examples.
9. **Into the Unknown**: This task evaluates the ability to gather new information. The dataset consists of 1,824 examples.
10. **Hindsight Neglect**: This task assesses decision-making based on expected value. The dataset contains 315 examples.
11. **Repetitive Algebra**: This task tests arithmetic reasoning. The dataset has 1,000 examples.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The paper does not provide specific citations for the datasets directly, but it mentions that the datasets were collected during the **Inverse Scaling Prize** contest, which is hosted at inversescaling.com/data. Therefore, I will cite the contest as the source of these datasets.

The citation for the contest is:
> McKenzie, I. R., Lyzhov, A., Pieler, M., Parrish, A., Mueller, A., Prabhu, A., McLean, E., et al. (2023). *Inverse Scaling Prize*. Retrieved from https://inversescaling.com/data.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries along with their descriptions and the citation for the contest into a structured format for further processing.
