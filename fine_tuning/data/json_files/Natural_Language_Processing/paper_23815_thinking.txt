To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Collaborative Team Recognition: A Core Plus Extension Structure" by Shuo Yu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention the use of "scholarly big graph data" and refer to the Microsoft Academic Graph (MAG) dataset. This indicates that there is at least one dataset that is crucial to the research.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methods or experiments sections**. In this paper, the authors explicitly state that they utilized the **Microsoft Academic Graph** dataset, specifically the computer science discipline (MAG-CS), which contains over 9 million publications and more than 12 million scholars.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the Microsoft Academic Graph dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:

> Sinha, A., Shen, Z., Song, Y., Ma, H., Eide, D., Hsu, B.J.P., Wang, K. (2015). An overview of Microsoft Academic Service (MAS) and applications. In Proceedings of the 24th International Conference on World Wide Web, Association for Computing Machinery, pp. 243â€“246.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the dataset details:

1. **Microsoft Academic Graph (MAG-CS)**: A large-scale dataset containing research publications in the computer science discipline, comprising 9,987,172 publications and 12,552,004 scholars.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format, ensuring that the dataset name, description, and full citation are clearly presented for future reference or processing.
