To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Grasp Force Optimization as a Bilinear Matrix Inequality Problem: A Deep Learning Approach" by Hirakjyoti Basumatary et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, which may hint at the datasets used. The introduction often outlines the context and significance of the research, potentially mentioning specific datasets.

Next, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets in the **methodology section**. This section typically details the experimental setup and may include specific datasets used for training or validation. I will pay close attention to any numerical experiments or simulations described, as they often rely on specific datasets.

In the **results section**, I will check for any references to datasets used in the experiments. The authors may discuss the performance of their methods on these datasets, which can provide additional context and confirmation of their use.

After identifying potential datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access the datasets.

From my reading, I will look for the following datasets:

1. **PyBullet GraspIt Simulator**: This is mentioned in the context of grasp analysis problems. The citation is:
   > Ceres, P. (2023). *Pybullet grasp planning*. Retrieved from https://github.com/planetceres/pybullet-grasp

2. **Multi-fingered Grasping Force Optimization Dataset**: This dataset is referenced in the context of grasp force optimization. The citation is:
   > Chen, Z., Wu, Q., Hong, C., Zhang, X. (2021). Multi-fingered grasping force optimization based on generalized penalty-function concepts. *Robotics and Autonomous Systems*, 135, 103672.

3. **Sequential Semidefinite Programming Dataset**: This dataset is referenced in the context of synthesizing and optimizing force closure grasps. The citation is:
   > Dai, H., Majumdar, A., Tedrake, R. (2018). Synthesis and optimization of force closure grasps via sequential semidefinite programming. *Robotics Research: Volume 1*, 285–305.

4. **Deep Learning Approach for Linear Programming Problems**: This dataset is referenced in the context of using deep learning for optimization. The citation is:
   > Wu, D., Lisser, A. (2023). A deep learning approach for solving linear programming problems. *Neurocomputing*, 520, 15–24.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
