To extract datasets from the research paper titled "BEAF: Observing BEfore-AFter Changes to Evaluate Hallucination in Vision-language Models" by Moon Ye-Bin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract introduces a new evaluation dataset called the **BEfore-AFter hallucination dataset (BEAF)**, which is a strong indication that this is a primary dataset of interest.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (BEAF Evaluation Benchmark for Hallucination)**, where the authors describe the dataset in detail. Here, they mention that the BEAF dataset consists of **26,118 image-question pairs**, derived from **500 original images** sampled from the validation set of the **MS-COCO dataset**. This section provides crucial details about the dataset's construction and purpose.

In this section, the authors also explain the manipulation process for creating the dataset, which involves removing objects from the original images and generating associated questions. This manipulation is key to the dataset's evaluation of hallucination in vision-language models.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the **MS-COCO dataset**, as it is a foundational dataset used in the creation of the BEAF dataset. The citation for the MS-COCO dataset is:

- **MS-COCO Dataset**:
  > Lin, T.Y., Maire, M., Belongie, S., Hays, J., Perona, P., Ramanan, D., DollÃ¡r, P., Zitnick, C.L. *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. In Proceedings of the European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), 2014.

The BEAF dataset itself is a new dataset introduced in this paper, so I will create a citation for it based on the authors' information:

- **BEAF Dataset**:
  > Moon Ye-Bin, Nam Hyeon-Woo, Wonseok Choi, Tae-Hyun Oh. *BEAF: Observing BEfore-AFter Changes to Evaluate Hallucination in Vision-language Models*. In Proceedings of the [Conference Name], [Year].

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. This includes ensuring that I have captured the purpose, size, and construction details of the BEAF dataset, as well as the foundational role of the MS-COCO dataset in its creation.
