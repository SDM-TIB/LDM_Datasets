To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Breaking Bias, Building Bridges: Evaluation and Mitigation of Social Biases in LLMs via Contact Hypothesis" by Chahat Raj et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions the creation of a dataset of **108,000 prompts** designed to measure biases in three large language models (LLMs) across 13 social bias dimensions. This indicates that a significant dataset is present, and I need to gather more details about it.

Next, I will look into the **Data and Methods** section, particularly focusing on **section 2** where the authors describe the dataset creation process. Here, they detail the components of the dataset, including prompt scales, templates, contact actions, scenarios, and bias dimensions. They explicitly state that the dataset consists of **108,000 prompt sets** organized around six key principles of the Contact Hypothesis and five scenarios.

The authors provide a comprehensive breakdown of how the dataset was structured, including the number of unique bias descriptors (600) and the types of prompts (no contact, positive contact, negative contact). This detailed description confirms the dataset's significance and its intended use for evaluating social biases in LLMs.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The authors do not provide a specific citation for the dataset itself, but they mention that their code and data are available on GitHub. Therefore, I will include the GitHub link as the citation for the dataset.

The citation for the dataset is:
> Raj, C., Mukherjee, A., Caliskan, A., Anastasopoulos, A., & Zhu, Z. (2023). *Breaking Bias, Building Bridges: Evaluation and Mitigation of Social Biases in LLMs via Contact Hypothesis*. Available at: https://github.com/chahatraj/breakingbias

In summary, I have identified the dataset created in this research paper, which consists of **108,000 prompts** designed to evaluate biases in LLMs. The dataset is structured around key principles of the Contact Hypothesis and spans various social scenarios. The citation for the dataset is derived from the paper's GitHub repository.

Now, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
