To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Large-Scale Person Detection and Localization using Overhead Fisheye Cameras" by Lu Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are introduced or referenced. The abstract mentions the LOAF dataset, which is described as the first large-scale overhead fisheye dataset for person detection and localization. This indicates that there is at least one dataset to extract.

Next, I will examine **section 3 (LOAF Dataset)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the LOAF dataset. Here, I will look for specifics such as the number of images, annotations, and any unique features that distinguish this dataset from others. The authors highlight that LOAF consists of over 42,942 images and 457,762 person-detection annotations, which are crucial details to note.

In addition, I will check the **comparison table (Table 1)** in section 3.4, which compares LOAF with other existing datasets. This table lists several datasets, including PIROPO, HABBOF, MW-R, and CEPDOF, along with their respective statistics. I will need to extract the names and relevant details of these datasets as well.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This is essential for proper attribution and to provide a complete picture of the datasets used in the research.

The datasets I will extract are:

1. **LOAF Dataset**: The primary dataset introduced in the paper, which is the first large-scale overhead fisheye dataset for person detection and localization.
   - Citation: Yang, L., Li, L., Xin, X., Sun, Y., Song, Q., & Wang, W. (2023). Large-Scale Person Detection and Localization using Overhead Fisheye Cameras. *Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)*.

2. **PIROPO Dataset**: A dataset referenced in the comparison table.
   - Citation: Del Blanco, C. R., Carballeira, P., Jaureguizar, F., & Garc√≠a, N. (2021). Robust people indoor localization with omnidirectional cameras using a grid of spatial-aware classifiers. *Signal Processing: Image Communication*.

3. **HABBOF Dataset**: Another dataset mentioned in the comparison.
   - Citation: Li, S., Tezcan, O., Ishwar, P., & Konrad, J. (2019). Supervised people counting using an overhead fisheye camera. *IEEE International Conference on Advanced Video and Signal Based Surveillance*.

4. **MW-R Dataset**: Also included in the comparison.
   - Citation: Duan, Z., Tezcan, O., Nakamura, H., Ishwar, P., & Konrad, J. (2020). RAPID: Rotation-aware people detection in overhead fisheye images. *CVPR Workshop*.

5. **CEPDOF Dataset**: The last dataset referenced in the comparison.
   - Citation: Duan, Z., Tezcan, O., Ishwar, P., & Konrad, J. (2020). CEPDOF: A dataset and benchmark algorithms for in-the-wild people detection and tracking from overhead fisheye cameras. *WACV*.

Finally, I will compile the extracted datasets and their citations into a structured format for easy reference and further processing.
