To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Existence Is Chaos: Enhancing 3D Human Motion Prediction with Uncertainty Consideration" by Zhihao Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention the datasets used. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets in relation to the study.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of human motion prediction and the importance of datasets in evaluating their proposed method. They mention that their experiments were conducted on benchmark datasets, which indicates that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors explicitly mention three datasets used for their experiments:

1. **Human3.6M Dataset (H3.6M)**: This dataset consists of 15 actions performed by 7 actors, with the human body represented as 32 joints. The authors note that global information is removed and that they test their model on a specific actor (S5).

2. **CMU Motion Capture Dataset (CMU Mocap)**: This dataset is also widely used for human motion prediction, consisting of 8 actions and 25 joints for each pose. The authors mention that their processing is similar to that of the H3.6M dataset.

3. **3D Pose in the Wild Dataset (3DPW)**: This dataset includes both indoor and outdoor actions captured at 30Hz, with each pose having 26 joints (23 of which are used in their experiments). The authors refer to the official segmented training, validation, and test sets.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations for the datasets mentioned in the paper are as follows:

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
