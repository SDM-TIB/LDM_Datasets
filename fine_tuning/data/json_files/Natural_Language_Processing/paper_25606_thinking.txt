To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Generalization vs. Memorization: Tracing Language Models’ Capabilities Back to Pretraining Data" by Xinyi Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study and may mention key datasets used for evaluation.

In the **introduction**, I will look for any references to datasets that are critical to the experiments or analyses presented in the paper. The authors often introduce the datasets they will be using in this section.

Next, I will focus on the **method section**, where the authors typically describe their experimental setup in detail. This section often includes specific datasets used for training and evaluation, along with any relevant characteristics or statistics about these datasets.

In the **experimental setup section**, the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. Here, I will find the following datasets:

1. **Pile Dataset**: This dataset is mentioned as the pretraining corpus for the Pythia models. It is described as a diverse pretraining corpus consisting of approximately 207 billion tokens.

2. **WMT-09 Dataset**: This dataset is used for the machine translation task. It is a classic annual machine translation shared task with a testing set of 2.5K examples.

3. **TriviaQA Dataset**: This dataset is utilized for the factual question answering task, containing a testing set of 10K examples.

4. **MMLU Benchmark**: This benchmark is used for evaluating world knowledge questions and covers 57 tasks, including various subjects like mathematics and history.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **references section** to retrieve the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **Pile Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Gao, L., Biderman, S., Black, S., Golding, L., Hoppe, T., Foster, C., Phang, J., He, H., Thite, A., Nabeshima, N., et al. (2020). *The Pile: An 800GB Dataset of Diverse Text for Language Modeling*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2101.00027.

- For the **WMT-09 Dataset**, the citation is:

- For the **TriviaQA Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Joshi, M., Choi, E., Weld, D., & Zettlemoyer, L. (2017). *TriviaQA: A Large Scale Distantly Supervised Challenge Dataset for Reading Comprehension*. In Proceedings of the 55th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers), pages 1601–1611. URL: https://aclanthology.org/P17-1147.

- For the **MMLU Benchmark**, the citation is:
  > Hendrycks, D., Burns, C., Basart, S., Zou, A., Mazeika, M., Song, D., & Steinhardt, J. (2020). *Measuring Massive Multitask Language Understanding*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2009.03300. URL: https://github.com/hendrycks/test.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
