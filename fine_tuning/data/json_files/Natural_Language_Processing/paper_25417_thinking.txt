To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Novel Dependency Framework for Enhancing Discourse Data Analysis" by Kun Sun and Rong Wang, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** sections to get an overview of the study's objectives and any datasets that may be referenced. The abstract mentions the conversion of PDTB annotations into dependency structures and the use of discourse parsers across multiple languages, which suggests that there may be specific datasets involved.

Next, I will examine the **methods section**, particularly the subsections that discuss the datasets used for experiments. In this paper, the authors mention several corpora, including:

1. **Penn Discourse Treebank (PDTB)**: This is a well-known dataset used for annotating discourse relations in English. The authors describe how they convert PDTB annotations into dependency structures.

2. **Chinese Discourse Treebank**: This dataset is referenced in the context of validating the dependency data derived from PDTB-style corpora in Chinese.

3. **TED-CDB**: A dataset that contains discourse relations from TED talks in Chinese, which is also used for validation.

4. **TED-MDB**: A multilingual discourse bank that includes translations and discourse annotations across several languages.

In the **experiments section**, the authors detail how they applied discourse parsers to these datasets, confirming their use in the study. This section provides additional context for the datasets, including their sizes and the specific tasks they were used for.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. Here are the citations I will include:

- For **Penn Discourse Treebank (PDTB)**:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant datasets from the paper.
