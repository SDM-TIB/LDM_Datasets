To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Interior Point Constrained Reinforcement Learning with Global Convergence Guarantees" by Tingting Ni and Maryam Kamgarpour, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often highlights the datasets used for experiments.

Next, I will look for specific sections that typically contain dataset information, such as **"Datasets," "Experiments," or "Methodology."** In this paper, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors are likely to describe the datasets used for their experiments.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention using a specific dataset for their experiments. I will note the name of the dataset and any relevant details provided, such as the number of samples, features, or any specific characteristics that are highlighted.

After identifying the dataset, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the dataset.

For example, if the authors mention using the **OpenAI Gym** as a dataset for their experiments, I would look for the citation in the references. The citation might look something like this:
> Brockman, G., et al. (2016). *OpenAI Gym*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01583.

Once I have the dataset name and its citation, I will compile this information into a structured format that includes:
1. The name of the dataset.
2. A brief description of the dataset.
3. The full citation for the dataset.

Finally, I will ensure that all extracted information is accurate and properly formatted before concluding the extraction process. This systematic approach will help ensure that I capture all relevant datasets mentioned in the paper along with their citations.
