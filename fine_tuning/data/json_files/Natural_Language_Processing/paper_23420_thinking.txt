To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DNCs Require More Planning Steps" by Yara Shamshoum et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to find any references to datasets. The abstract mentions evaluating the method on various algorithmic tasks, which suggests that datasets may be involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section (Section 4)**, as it typically contains detailed descriptions of the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, the authors describe four algorithmic tasks: **Graph Shortest Path, Convex Hull, Graph MinCut, and Associative Recall**. I will look for any specific datasets or data generation methods mentioned for these tasks.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors describe the data generation process for each task in **Appendix A**. Here are the key datasets identified:

1. **Graph Shortest Path Task**: The dataset is generated by sampling graphs with a specific number of nodes and edges. The authors mention that they ensure a unique shortest path for training purposes.

2. **MinCut Task**: Similar to the Shortest Path task, this dataset is generated by creating connected graphs with specific parameters, ensuring a unique minimum cut for training.

3. **Associative Recall Task**: The dataset consists of lists of binary vectors, where the number of items and digits per item are parameterized.

4. **Convex Hull Task**: The dataset is generated by sampling 2D points uniformly from a specified range, with the output being the convex hull of these points.

Now, I will look for full citations for any datasets or relevant papers referenced in the text. The paper does not provide explicit citations for the datasets themselves, but it does reference foundational works related to the tasks, such as:

- For the **Differentiable Neural Computer (DNC)**, the citation is:
  > Graves, A., Wayne, G., & Danihelka, I. (2016). Hybrid computing using a neural network with dynamic external memory. *Nature*, 538(7626), 471-476. doi:10.1038/nature20101.

- For the **Associative Recall Task**, the foundational work is:
  > Graves, A., Wayne, G., & Danihelka, I. (2014). Neural Turing Machines. *arXiv preprint arXiv:1410.5401*.

I will compile the dataset entries along with their descriptions and citations into a structured format for clarity and future reference.

In summary, I have identified the datasets related to the tasks described in the paper and noted the relevant citations for foundational works that inform these tasks. This will allow for a comprehensive understanding of the datasets used in the research.
