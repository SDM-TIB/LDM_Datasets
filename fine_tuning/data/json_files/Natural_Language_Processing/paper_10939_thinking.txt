To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Trompt: Towards a Better Deep Neural Network for Tabular Data" by Kuan-Yu Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that Trompt is evaluated on a benchmark called **Grinsztajn45**, which suggests that this benchmark consists of multiple datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In the introduction, the authors refer to the Grinsztajn45 benchmark, which is described as consisting of **45 curated datasets from various domains**. This indicates that the datasets are likely diverse and sourced from different applications.

In the **experiments section**, the authors confirm that Trompt is evaluated on the Grinsztajn45 benchmark. I will look for any specific datasets listed within this benchmark. The paper provides a brief overview of the benchmark's selection criteria, but it does not list the individual datasets directly in the main text. Instead, I will check the **appendices** for detailed information about the datasets included in Grinsztajn45.

Upon reviewing the appendices, I find that the datasets are indeed listed, along with their respective characteristics. The paper provides a notation for the datasets, which I will use to reference them accurately.

Now, I will compile the full citations for the datasets mentioned in the Grinsztajn45 benchmark. The paper cites the following key references for the benchmark:

1. **Grinsztajn45 Benchmark**:
   - Grinsztajn, L., Oyallon, E., & Varoquaux, G. (2022). Why do tree-based models still outperform deep learning on typical tabular data? In *Thirty-sixth Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems Datasets and Benchmarks Track*. URL: https://openreview.net/forum?id=Fp7__phQszn.

2. **OpenML** (source of datasets):
   - Vanschoren, J., van Rijn, J. N., Bischl, B., & Torgo, L. (2013). OpenML: networked science in machine learning. *SIGKDD Explorations*, 15(2), 49-60. doi:10.1145/2641190.2641198. URL: http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/2641190.2641198.

Next, I will summarize the datasets included in the Grinsztajn45 benchmark based on the information provided in the appendices. The datasets cover various domains and tasks, including classification and regression tasks, and are characterized by their heterogeneous features.

Finally, I will ensure that I have documented the datasets with their respective citations accurately, as this is crucial for proper attribution and further research.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for review or downstream processing, ensuring that each dataset is clearly identified and cited according to the references provided in the paper.
