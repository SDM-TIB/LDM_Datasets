To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Mitigating Catastrophic Forgetting in Multi-domain Chinese Spelling Correction by Multi-stage Knowledge Transfer Framework" by Peng Xing et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the focus on multi-domain Chinese Spelling Correction (CSC) and hints at the use of various datasets for experiments.

Next, I will examine **section 3 (Experiment and Result)**, specifically the **subsection 3.1 (Datasets and Metrics)**, where the authors detail the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention four domains: General, Car, Medical, and Legal. They also specify the datasets associated with these domains.

1. **General Domain**: The authors utilize the **SIGHAN13, SIGHAN14, and SIGHAN15** datasets for training, and the **SIGHAN15 test set** for evaluation. 

2. **Car Domain**: They mention using a dataset referred to as **CAR**, which consists of 500 samples for testing.

3. **Medical Domain**: The **MED** dataset is also mentioned, with 500 samples taken for testing.

4. **Legal Domain**: Similarly, the **LAW** dataset is referenced, again with 500 samples for testing.

The paper provides statistics about these datasets in **Appendix B**, which includes the number of sentences, average length, and number of errors, confirming their relevance and use in the experiments.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **SIGHAN datasets**:
  > Yuen-Hsien Tseng, Lung-Hao Lee, Li-Ping Chang, and Hsin-Hsi Chen. *Introduction to SIGHAN 2015 bake-off for Chinese spelling check*. In Proceedings of the Eighth SIGHAN Workshop on Chinese Language Processing, pages 32–37, Beijing, China, 2015. Association for Computational Linguistics.

- For **Wang271K**:
  > Dingmin Wang, Yan Song, Jing Li, Jialong Han, and Haisong Zhang. *A hybrid approach to automatic corpus generation for Chinese spelling check*. In Proceedings of the 2018 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 2517–2527, Brussels, Belgium, 2018. Association for Computational Linguistics.

- For **CAR, MED, and LAW datasets**, the citations are not explicitly provided in the references, but they are mentioned as resources released by LEMON and ECSpell, which are likely to have their own citations.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
