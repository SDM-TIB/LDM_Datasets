To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CALM: A Multi-task Benchmark for Comprehensive Assessment of Language Model Bias" by Vipul Gupta et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that CALM integrates sixteen datasets for various NLP tasks, which suggests that multiple datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (CALM DATA AND SCORE)**, which is likely to provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used for the three NLP tasks: Question Answering (QA), Sentiment Analysis (SA), and Natural Language Inference (NLI). This section is crucial as it outlines the specific datasets that contribute to the CALM benchmark.

In **subsection 3.1 (Question Answering)**, the paper lists eight datasets used for the QA task, including:

1. **bAbI**: Weston et al. (2016) provides a set of 20 toy QA tasks for narrative understanding and reasoning.

After gathering all the relevant datasets and their citations, I will ensure that I format them correctly for any required output or documentation. This structured approach will help maintain clarity and accuracy in the dataset extraction process.
