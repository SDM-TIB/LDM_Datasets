To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MM-BigBench: Evaluating Multimodal Models on Multimodal Content Comprehension Tasks" by Xiaocui Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and the datasets section** of the paper. The abstract mentions the introduction of a comprehensive assessment framework called MM-BigBench, which suggests that multiple datasets are involved in the evaluation of multimodal models.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Multimodal Tasks and Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for evaluation. This section provides a detailed overview of the datasets associated with different tasks, which is crucial for my extraction process.

In this section, I will identify the datasets mentioned for each task:

1. **Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA)**:
   - **MVSA-Single Dataset**: Used for sentiment analysis on text-image pairs.
   - **MVSA-Multiple Dataset**: Another dataset for sentiment analysis on text-image pairs.
   - **TumEmo Dataset**: A dataset for sentiment analysis based on videos.
   - **MOSI-2 and MOSI-7 Datasets**: Video datasets for sentiment analysis.

2. **Multimodal Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (MABSA)**:
   - **Twitter-2015 Dataset**: Used for aspect-based sentiment analysis.
   - **Twitter-2017 Dataset**: Another dataset for aspect-based sentiment analysis.
   - **MASAD Dataset**: A dataset for aspect-based sentiment analysis.

3. **Multimodal Hateful Memes Recognition (MHMR)**:
   - **Hate Dataset**: A dataset for recognizing hateful memes.

4. **Multimodal Sarcasm Recognition (MSR)**:
   - **Sarcasm Dataset**: A dataset for detecting sarcasm in multimodal content.

5. **Multimodal Relation Extraction (MRE)**:
   - **MNRE Dataset**: A dataset for relation extraction between entities in multimodal content.

6. **Visual Question Answering (VQA)**:
   - **ScienceQA Dataset**: A dataset for visual question answering that includes both image and text context.

After identifying these datasets, I will then refer to the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial as the citations provide the necessary context and credit to the original authors of the datasets.

The citations I will look for include:

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries along with their full citations to ensure that they are ready for any further processing or review.
