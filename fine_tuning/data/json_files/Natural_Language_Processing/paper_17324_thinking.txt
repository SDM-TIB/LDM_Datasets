To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MetaSegNet: Metadata-collaborative Vision-Language Representation Learning for Semantic Segmentation of Remote Sensing Images" by Libo Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their method on several datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 3.1 (Experimental settings)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention three datasets:

1. **OpenEarthMap**: This dataset is described as a large-scale high-resolution land cover mapping dataset consisting of 5000 images with 8-class land cover labels. The authors provide details about the spatial resolution and the distribution of images across training, validation, and test sets.

2. **Potsdam**: The Potsdam dataset is characterized as containing 38 very fine resolution aerial images with specific classes of geo-objects. The authors mention the number of multispectral bands and the partitioning of the dataset into training, validation, and test sets.

3. **LoveDA**: This dataset includes 5987 fine-resolution optical remote sensing images collected from three cities in China. The authors specify the number of images used for training, validation, and testing, along with the land cover categories.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The citations I will extract are:

- For **OpenEarthMap**, the citation is:
  > Xia, J., Yokoya, N., Adriano, B., Broni-Bediako, C. (2023). *OpenEarthMap: A Benchmark Dataset for Global High-Resolution Land Cover Mapping*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision, pp. 6254â€“6264.

- For **Potsdam**, the citation is:
  > The International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (ISPRS). *ISPRS Potsdam Dataset*. Available at: [ISPRS website link].

- For **LoveDA**, the citation is:
  > Wang, J., Zheng, Z., Ma, A., Lu, X., Zhong, Y. (2021). *LoveDA: A Remote Sensing Land-Cover Dataset for Domain Adaptive Semantic Segmentation*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2110.08733.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This will ensure that the datasets are accurately represented and properly cited in any subsequent work.
