To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Mixture of In-Context Experts" by Hongzhan Lin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned or referenced. The abstract discusses the introduction of a method called MoICE but does not explicitly mention any datasets. However, the introduction may provide insights into the datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will examine **section 4 (Experiment)**, as this section typically contains details about the datasets used in the experiments. In this case, the authors mention using a training dataset extracted from **OpenHermes**, which is described as a multi-source integrated dataset containing high-quality synthetically generated instruction and chat samples. The specific reference to the dataset is crucial.

I will also look for any additional datasets mentioned in the **experiments** or **results** sections. The paper discusses various tasks and benchmarks but primarily focuses on the OpenHermes dataset for training. 

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the OpenHermes dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:
> Teknium. Openhermes 2.5: An open dataset of synthetic data for generalist LLM assistants, 2023.

Since this is the only dataset explicitly mentioned in the paper, I will document it accordingly.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that the full citation is included for the dataset extracted from the paper. This will ensure that the dataset is properly attributed and can be referenced in future work.
