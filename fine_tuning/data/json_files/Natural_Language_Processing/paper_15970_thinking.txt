To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Learning-Based Object Detection in Maritime Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Imagery: Review and Experimental Comparisons" by Chenjie Zhao et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and datasets sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the proposal of a maritime UAV aerial dataset named **MS2ship** for ship detection, which indicates that there is at least one dataset to extract.

Next, I will look closely at **section 5 (UAV-based Datasets)**, where the authors provide a detailed review of existing UAV aerial datasets. This section is likely to contain valuable information about various datasets used in their research. 

In this section, the authors mention several datasets, including:

1. **Seagull Dataset**: This dataset is the first publicly available video dataset for maritime surveillance, containing various object types such as cargo ships and patrol boats. The citation is:
   > Ribeiro, R., Cruz, G., Matos, J., Bernardino, A. (2017). *A data set for airborne maritime surveillance environments*. IEEE Trans. Circuits Syst. Video Technol., 29, 2720–2732.

2. **AFO Dataset**: Designed for maritime search and rescue applications, it includes 50 videos captured in different environments. The citation is:
   > Gasienica-Jozkowy, J., Knapik, M., Cyganek, B. (2021). *An ensemble deep learning method with optimized weights for drone-based water rescue and surveillance*. Integr. Comput. Aided Eng., 28, 221–235.

3. **MOBDrone Dataset**: This dataset focuses on overboard rescue missions and contains 66 video clips. The citation is:
   > Cafarelli, D., Ciampi, L., Vadicamo, L., et al. (2022). *Mobdrone: A drone video dataset for man overboard rescue*. Image Analysis and Processing–ICIAP 2022: 21st International Conference, Springer, 633–644.

4. **SeaDronesSee Dataset**: This dataset is used for object detection and tracking, providing six categories of labeled objects. The citation is:
   > Varga, L.A., Kiefer, B., Messmer, M., Zell, A. (2022). *Seadronessee: A maritime benchmark for detecting humans in open water*. Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision, 2260–2270.

5. **ShipDataset**: This dataset covers various scenarios with different shooting angles and lighting conditions. The citation is:
   > Zhao, J., Chen, Y., Zhou, Z., et al. (2023). *Multi-ship speed measurement method based on machine vision and drone images*. IEEE Trans. Instrum. Meas.

Additionally, the authors propose their own dataset, **MS2ship**, which consists of 6,470 images with a total of 13,697 boxes for ship detection. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Zhao, C., Liu, R.W., Qu, J., Gao, R. (2023). *MS2ship: A maritime UAV aerial dataset for ship detection*. Available at: https://github.com/zcj234/MS2ship.

After identifying these datasets, I will ensure to compile the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper, as this is crucial for proper referencing.

Finally, I will summarize the extracted datasets and their citations in a structured format for easy reference and further processing.
