To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Self context-aware emotion perception on human-robot interaction" by Zihan Lin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the introduction of a self context-aware model (SCAM) for emotion recognition, which suggests that datasets may be involved in the evaluation of this model.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention the importance of emotion recognition in human-robot interaction and reference existing models and datasets. I will look for specific names of datasets in this section.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly **section 3 (Methods)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for training and validation. Here, they state that they conducted their experiments on the **IEMOCAP dataset**. This dataset is described as comprising 10,039 instances performed by 10 actors, which is crucial information for my extraction.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide results based on the IEMOCAP dataset, confirming its use in their evaluations. This reinforces the importance of this dataset in their research.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to retrieve the full citation for the IEMOCAP dataset:

- For the **IEMOCAP dataset**, the citation is:
  > C. Busso, M. Bulut, C. C. Lee, A. Kazemzadeh, E. Mower, S. Kim, and S. S. Narayanan. *IEMOCAP: Interactive emotional dyadic motion capture database*. Language Resources and Evaluation, 42, 335-359, 2008.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the IEMOCAP dataset.

After completing this process, I will have a clear and concise entry for the dataset used in the research, ready for further processing or review.
