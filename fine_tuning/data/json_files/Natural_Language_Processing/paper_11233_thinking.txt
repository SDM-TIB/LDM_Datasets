To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Defocus to Focus: Photo-realistic Bokeh Rendering by Fusing Defocus and Radiance Priors" by Xianrui Luo et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their model on a "large-scale bokeh dataset," which suggests that a specific dataset is used.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Dataset and Experimental Setup)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset used for their experiments. Here, they mention the dataset called **EBB! (Everything is Better with Bokeh!)**, which consists of 4,694 aligned wide/shallow depth-of-field image pairs captured using a Canon 7D DSLR camera. This section also describes the dataset's purpose and how it was divided into training and validation sets.

To ensure I have the correct citation for the dataset, I will check the **References section** of the paper. The authors reference the dataset as follows:
> Ignatov, A., Patel, J., Timofte, R. (2020). *AIM 2020 Challenge on Rendering Realistic Bokeh*. In European Conference on Computer Vision, Springer, pp. 213–228.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the dataset as required.

In summary, I will extract the following dataset information:
1. **Dataset Name**: EBB!
   - **Description**: A large-scale dataset consisting of 4,694 aligned wide/shallow depth-of-field image pairs captured using a Canon 7D DSLR with 50mm f/1.8 lenses.
   - **Citation**: Ignatov, A., Patel, J., Timofte, R. (2020). *AIM 2020 Challenge on Rendering Realistic Bokeh*. In European Conference on Computer Vision, Springer, pp. 213–228.

After gathering this information, I will prepare it for downstream processing or review.
