To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Exploring Teacher-Student Learning Approach for Multi-lingual Speech-to-Intent Classification" by Bidisha Sharma et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the research context and any datasets that might be referenced. The abstract mentions the use of synthesized speech generated from an English-Mandarin text corpus, which suggests that there are datasets involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 3) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention two specific datasets:

1. **Synthesized English-Mandarin Corpus**: This dataset consists of synthesized speech obtained from a multi-lingual text-to-speech (TTS) system. The authors provide details about the number of utterances, unique utterances, duration, and speakers involved in both English and Mandarin languages.

2. **Recorded English-Mandarin Corpus**: This dataset includes recorded utterances from native Mandarin speakers who are fluent in both languages. The authors also provide quantitative details similar to the synthesized corpus.

I will extract the specific details about these datasets, including their structure and any relevant statistics provided in the tables.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper references the Fluent Speech Commands (FSC) dataset as the base text material for designing the multilingual synthesized and recorded speech corpora. The citation for the FSC dataset is:

In ICASSP 2021-2021 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP). IEEE, 2021, pp. 7498â€“7502.

Next, I will compile the dataset entries with their descriptions and citations. 

Finally, I will ensure that each dataset is clearly documented with its full citation, ready for further processing or review.
