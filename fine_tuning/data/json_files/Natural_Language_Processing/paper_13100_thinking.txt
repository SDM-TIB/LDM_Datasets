To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Auxiliary Tasks Benefit 3D Skeleton-based Human Motion Prediction" by Chenxin Xu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on several datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they list three datasets:

1. **Human3.6M**: This dataset is described as containing 7 subjects performing 15 types of actions with 22 body joints. The sequences are downsampled and converted to 3D coordinates, excluding global rotation and translation.

2. **CMU-MoCap**: This dataset includes 8 human action types with 38 body joints, also converted to 3D coordinates. The authors mention that they keep 25 joints and divide the training and testing datasets.

3. **3DPW**: This dataset is for human pose prediction and contains indoor and outdoor activities represented in 3D space, with each subject having 23 joints.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Human3.6M**, the citation is:
  > Catalin Ionescu, Dragos Papava, Vlad Olaru, and Cristian Sminchisescu. *Human3.6m: Large scale datasets and predictive methods for 3d human sensing in natural environments*. IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 36(7):1325–1339, 2013.

- For **CMU-MoCap**, the citation is:
  > The CMU Motion Capture Database. *CMU-MoCap*. [Online]. Available: http://mocap.cs.cmu.edu/.

- For **3DPW**, the citation is:
  > Timo Von Marcard, Roberto Henschel, Michael J Black, Bodo Rosenhahn, and Gerard Pons-Moll. *Recovering accurate 3D human pose in the wild using IMUs and a moving camera*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 1–10, 2019.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations.
