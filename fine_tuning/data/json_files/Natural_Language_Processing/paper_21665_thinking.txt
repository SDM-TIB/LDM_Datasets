To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Relationship Discovery for Drug Recommendation" by Xiang Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted comprehensive testing on real-world datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors provide details about the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they specifically mention two datasets:

1. **MIMIC-III**: This dataset is described as a freely accessible critical care database containing clinical data from 6,350 patients, including various clinical events, diseases, procedures, and medications.

2. **MIMIC-IV**: This is another freely accessible electronic health record dataset, which includes data from 60,125 patients and is an updated version of MIMIC-III.

In the **experiments setup**, the authors provide statistics for both datasets, confirming their use in the study. This is crucial as it validates that these datasets were indeed utilized for the experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **MIMIC-III**, the citation is:
  > Alistair EW Johnson, Tom J Pollard, Lu Shen, Li-wei H Lehman, Mengling Feng, Mohammad Ghassemi, Benjamin Moody, Peter Szolovits, Leo Anthony Celi, and Roger G Mark. *MIMIC-III, a freely accessible critical care database*. Scientific data, 3(1):1â€“9, 2016.

- For **MIMIC-IV**, the citation is:
  > Alistair EW Johnson, Lucas Bulgarelli, Lu Shen, Alvin Gayles, Ayad Shammout, Steven Horng, Tom J Pollard, Sicheng Hao, Benjamin Moody, Brian Gow, et al. *MIMIC-IV, a freely accessible electronic health record dataset*. Scientific data, 10(1):1, 2023.

With these citations in hand, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
