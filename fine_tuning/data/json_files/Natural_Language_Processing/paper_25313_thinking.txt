To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A mean field analysis of the role of indirect transmission in emergent infection events" by Tomás Ignacio González et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on indirect transmission and its implications for infectious diseases, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any references to datasets used in the study. The introduction discusses the mathematical modeling of infectious diseases and mentions various pathogens and their impacts, but again, it does not specify any datasets.

I will then look into the **results section** to see if the authors present any empirical data or datasets that support their findings. The results section discusses the dynamics of the model and the implications of indirect transmission, but it does not provide specific datasets.

Since the paper appears to focus on theoretical modeling rather than empirical data collection, I will check the **references section** to see if any datasets are cited indirectly through the literature. This may include studies that provided data used in their modeling or analysis.

After reviewing the references, I will compile any relevant citations that may correspond to datasets used in the context of the research. If the authors refer to existing datasets in their modeling, I will ensure to extract the full citations for those datasets.

Finally, I will summarize the findings and ensure that I have the complete citations for any datasets mentioned, even if they are not primary datasets but rather referenced studies that provided data for the modeling.

In this case, it seems that the paper does not explicitly mention any datasets, but I will still document any relevant references that could be associated with datasets used in similar studies or modeling efforts.
