To extract datasets from the research paper titled "More Samples or More Prompts? Exploring Effective Few-Shot In-Context Learning for LLMs with In-Context Sampling" by Bingsheng Yao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on **four NLI datasets (e-SNLI, Multi-NLI, ANLI, and Contract-NLI)** and one QA dataset (**CommonsenseQA**). This suggests that these datasets are crucial for the experiments.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the datasets are discussed in the **evaluation section** where they are listed with their respective citations. The authors provide a summary of the datasets used, including their purpose and the number of instances.

The datasets identified in the paper are:

1. **e-SNLI**: This dataset is referenced as "Camburu et al. (2018)" and is used for natural language inference tasks. It contains 549,367 training instances, 9,842 validation instances, and 9,824 test instances.

2. **Multi-NLI**: Cited as "Williams et al. (2017)", this dataset is also for natural language inference and includes 392,702 training instances, 9,815 validation instances, and 9,832 test instances.

3. **ANLI**: This dataset is referenced as "Nie et al. (2019)" and is used for adversarial natural language inference. It has 75 training instances, 808 validation instances, and 117 test instances.

4. **Contract-NLI**: Cited as "Koreeda and Manning (2021)", this dataset is specifically for document-level natural language inference for contracts, containing 334 instances for training, validation, and testing.

5. **CommonsenseQA**: This dataset is referenced as "Talmor et al. (2018)" and is used for commonsense question answering, with 16,946 training instances, 1,000 validation instances, and 1,000 test instances.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset from the **References section** of the paper:

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This systematic approach ensures that I accurately capture all relevant datasets and their citations from the research paper.
