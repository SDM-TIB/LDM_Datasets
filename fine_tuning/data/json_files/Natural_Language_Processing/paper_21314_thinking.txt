To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CRIC: A robust assessment for invariant representations" by Wenlu Tang and Zicheng Liu, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a high-level overview, and I will look for any references to datasets used for validation or experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors might discuss the context of their work and any datasets they reference. I will look for phrases that indicate the use of specific datasets or benchmarks.

In the **methodology** section, I will pay close attention to any subsections that detail the experimental setup. This is often where authors describe the datasets they used, including any specific characteristics or sizes of the datasets.

I will also examine the **experiments section** for any explicit mentions of datasets used in the numerical studies. This section typically contains detailed information about the datasets, including their sources, sizes, and any relevant characteristics.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to ensure that the datasets can be accessed by others.

For example, if the authors mention using a dataset like the "U.S. stock market data" in their experiments, I will look for the original source or publication that describes this dataset in detail. If they reference a specific dataset from another study, I will ensure to include that citation as well.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented and properly cited.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset information in a structured format for easy reference, making sure to highlight the importance of full citations for each dataset used in the research.
