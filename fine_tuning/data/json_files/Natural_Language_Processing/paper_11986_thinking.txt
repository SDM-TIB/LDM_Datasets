To extract datasets from the research paper titled "GIT: Detecting Uncertainty, Out-Of-Distribution and Adversarial Samples using Gradients and Invariance Transformations" by Julia Lust and Alexandru P. Condurache, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions evaluating GIT on various datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will focus on the **evaluation section** (Section IV) where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they explicitly mention four datasets:

1. **SVHN (Street View House Numbers)**: This dataset is commonly used for digit recognition tasks and consists of images of house numbers collected from Google Street View.

2. **CIFAR-10**: A well-known dataset containing 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes, widely used for training machine learning models.

3. **CIFAR-100**: Similar to CIFAR-10 but with 100 classes containing 600 images each, providing a more challenging classification task.

4. **ImageNet**: A large-scale dataset with millions of labeled images across thousands of categories, often used for training deep learning models in computer vision.

Additionally, the authors mention using the **KITTI dataset** for object detection experiments, which is a popular dataset for autonomous driving research.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **SVHN**, the citation is:
  > Yuval Netzer, Tao Wang, Adam Coates, Alessandro Bissacco, Bo Wu, and Andrew Y. Ng. *Reading digits in natural images with unsupervised feature learning*. In NIPS Workshop on Deep Learning and Unsupervised Feature Learning 2011, 2011.

- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. Technical report, 2009.

- For **CIFAR-100**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. Technical report, 2009.

- For **ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > J. Deng, W. Dong, R. Socher, L. Li, Kai Li, and Li Fei-Fei. *ImageNet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In 2009 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2009.

- For **KITTI**, the citation is:
  > Andreas Geiger, Philip Lenz, Christoph Stiller, and Raquel Urtasun. *Vision meets robotics: The KITTI dataset*. The International Journal of Robotics Research, 32(11):1231â€“1237, 2013.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries with their full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented and properly cited for future reference or processing. This structured approach will help ensure that all relevant datasets are captured comprehensively.
