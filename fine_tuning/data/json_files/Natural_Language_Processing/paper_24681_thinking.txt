To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Weight Clipping for Deep Continual and Reinforcement Learning" by Mohamed Elsayed et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss various challenges in deep learning and reinforcement learning, but they do not mention specific datasets yet. I will continue to the **experiments section**, which is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets used for evaluation.

In **section 4 (Experiments)**, the authors describe their experiments and mention three specific datasets:

1. **Input-Permuted MNIST**: This dataset is a variant of the MNIST dataset where the input images are permuted, making it a standard problem for studying loss of plasticity in neural networks.

2. **Label-Permuted EMNIST**: This dataset is a variant of the EMNIST dataset where the labels are permuted, which introduces challenges related to catastrophic forgetting.

3. **Label-Permuted mini-ImageNet**: Similar to the previous datasets, this dataset involves permuted labels and is used to evaluate the performance of the proposed method.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for future researchers.

- For **Input-Permuted MNIST**, the original MNIST dataset citation is:
  > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Chris Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998.

- For **EMNIST**, the citation is:
  > Cohen, G., Afshar, S., Tapson, J., & van Schaik, A. (2017). *EMNIST: An Extension of MNIST to Handwritten Letters*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1702.05373.

- For **mini-ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Vinyals, O., Blundell, C., Lillicrap, T., & Kavukcuoglu, K. (2016). *Matching Networks for One Shot Learning*. Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 29.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and future reference.

In summary, I have extracted the following datasets from the paper:

1. **Input-Permuted MNIST**
   - Citation: Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Chris Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998.

2. **Label-Permuted EMNIST**
   - Citation: Cohen, G., Afshar, S., Tapson, J., & van Schaik, A. (2017). *EMNIST: An Extension of MNIST to Handwritten Letters*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1702.05373.

3. **Label-Permuted mini-ImageNet**
   - Citation: Vinyals, O., Blundell, C., Lillicrap, T., & Kavukcuoglu, K. (2016). *Matching Networks for One Shot Learning*. Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 29.

With this information, I am ready to present the dataset entries in the required format for further processing or review.
