To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DAOT: Domain-Agnostically Aligned Optimal Transport for Domain-Adaptive Crowd Counting" by Huilin Zhu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on "five standard crowd-counting benchmarks," which suggests that multiple datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets and Implementation Details)**, where the authors typically provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used in their experiments. Here, I will look for specific names, descriptions, and any relevant statistics about each dataset.

In section 4.1, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **Shanghai Tech Dataset**: This dataset contains 1,198 scene images and 330,165 labeled head positions, subdivided into PartA (300 training images, 182 testing images) and PartB (400 training images, 316 testing images).

2. **UCF-QNRF Dataset**: A challenging dataset with 1,535 images of dense crowd scenes, including 1,201 training images and 334 testing images.

3. **NWPU-Crowd Dataset**: This dataset consists of 5,109 high-resolution images with 2,133,238 annotated entities.

4. **JHU-CROWD++ Dataset**: Contains 4,372 images with a total of 1.51 million annotations, including some based on extreme weather and light variations.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations for the datasets mentioned are as follows:

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations. This will ensure that the datasets are accurately represented and properly attributed for future reference.
