To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Classification of Safety Driver Attention During Autonomous Vehicle Operation" by Santiago Gerling Konrad et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that experiments were conducted using data collected in Sydney, Australia, which suggests that there is a dataset involved.

Next, I will focus on the **Methodology section**, specifically the **Dataset Collection subsection**. Here, the authors describe how data was gathered using electric vehicle platforms equipped with various sensors, including an infrared camera and vehicle perception systems. They mention that the data was collected during real driving scenarios with participants acting as safety drivers. This indicates that a dataset was created from this data collection process.

In this subsection, the authors provide details about the data collection process, including the number of laps completed (25) and the number of participants (7). However, they do not provide a specific name for the dataset, which is crucial for citation purposes.

To ensure I have the correct citation for the dataset, I will check the **References section** for any papers that might describe the dataset in detail. The authors reference a paper titled "Developing and testing robust autonomy: The university of sydney campus data set" by W. Zhou et al. This is likely the dataset used in their experiments.

The citation for this dataset is:
> W. Zhou, J. S. Berrio, C. De Alvis, M. Shan, S. Worrall, J. Ward, and E. Nebot. *Developing and testing robust autonomy: The university of sydney campus data set*. IEEE Intelligent Transportation Systems Magazine, vol. 12, no. 4, pp. 23â€“40, 2020.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the dataset details:

1. **University of Sydney Campus Dataset**: This dataset was collected during real driving scenarios involving safety drivers in an autonomous vehicle context. It includes data from various sensors, such as an infrared camera and vehicle perception systems, and consists of 25 laps completed by 7 participants.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that the citation is included for proper attribution.
