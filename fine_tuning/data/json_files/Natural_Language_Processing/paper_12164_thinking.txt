To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Switching Head–Tail Funnel UNITER for Dual Referring Expression Comprehension with Fetch-and-Carry Tasks" by Ryosuke Korekata et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors validated their method on a "newly-built dataset consisting of object manipulation instructions and semi photo-realistic images." This suggests that a dataset is indeed present.

Next, I will focus on **section V (Simulation Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly mention the creation of the **ALFRED-fc dataset** for the DREC-fc task. They describe how this dataset was built based on the original **ALFRED dataset**, which is a standard dataset for Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) tasks. The authors provide details about the dataset, including the number of image pairs and instructions, which is crucial for understanding its structure and purpose.

In this section, they mention that the **ALFRED-fc dataset** consists of 1,099 image pairs and 3,452 instructions, with specific details about how the dataset was constructed, including the balancing of positive and negative samples. This information is essential for accurately describing the dataset.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citation for both the **ALFRED dataset** and the **ALFRED-fc dataset**. The citation for the original ALFRED dataset is:

- For **ALFRED dataset**:
  > M. Shridhar et al., “ALFRED: A Benchmark for Interpreting Grounded Instructions for Everyday Tasks,” in CVPR, 2020, pp. 10 740–10 749.

The authors created the **ALFRED-fc dataset** based on the ALFRED dataset, but since it is a newly built dataset, it may not have a separate citation in the references. However, I will note that it is derived from the ALFRED dataset.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, ensuring to include the full citations for the datasets mentioned, particularly emphasizing the original ALFRED dataset as the authoritative source for the ALFRED-fc dataset.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring clarity and completeness in the descriptions.
