To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Graph Language Models" by Moritz Plenz and Anette Frank, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions empirical evaluations on relation classification tasks, which suggests that datasets are likely involved. I will look for specific mentions of datasets or references to data sources.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe their experimental setup. Here, they mention two datasets used for evaluation:

1. **ConceptNet**: The authors state that they constructed a balanced dataset of English ConceptNet subgraphs consisting of 13,600 train, 1,700 dev, and 1,700 test instances with 17 distinct relations as labels. This dataset is crucial for their relation classification experiments.

2. **Wikidata**: The paper describes a large-scale corpus of aligned Wikipedia abstracts and Wikidata triplets, which includes 2,449,582 train, 135,828 validation, and 135,923 test instances. This dataset is used for KG population tasks and is essential for understanding the model's performance in relation to text and graph data.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **ConceptNet**, the citation is:
  > Robyn Speer, Joshua Chin, and Catherine Havasi. *Conceptnet 5.5: An open multilingual graph of general knowledge*. In Proceedings of the Thirty-First AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, AAAI’17, page 4444–4451, 2017.

- For **Wikidata**, the citation is:
  > Denny Vrandeˇci´c and Markus Krötzsch. *Wikidata: A free collaborative knowledgebase*. Commun. ACM, 57(10):78–85, 2014.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
