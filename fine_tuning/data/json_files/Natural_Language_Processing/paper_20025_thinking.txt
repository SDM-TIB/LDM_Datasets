To extract datasets from the research paper titled "YYDS: Visible-Infrared Person Re-Identification with Coarse Descriptions" by Yunhao Du et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that experiments were conducted on **SYSU-MM01, RegDB, and LLCM datasets**, which suggests these are the datasets I need to focus on.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors describe the datasets in **section 4.1 (Datasets and Evaluation Protocol)**. Here, they provide details about each dataset:

1. **SYSU-MM01**: This dataset is the first large-scale benchmark for visible-infrared person re-identification, containing 22,258 visible images and 11,909 infrared images across 395 identities for training, and 96 identities for testing.

2. **RegDB**: A harsh lighting dataset with 206 identities for training and testing, where each person has 10 visible and 10 infrared images.

3. **LLCM**: A low-light dataset collected with 9 cameras, containing 30,921 images of 713 identities for training and 13,909 images of 351 identities for testing.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **SYSU-MM01**, the citation is:
  > Wu, A., Zheng, W.S., Yu, H.X., Gong, S., Lai, J. "RGB-infrared cross-modality person re-identification." In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision, pp. 5380–5389, 2017.

- For **RegDB**, the citation is:
  > Zhang, Y., Wang, H. "Diverse embedding expansion network and low-light cross-modality benchmark for visible-infrared person re-identification." In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 2153–2162, 2023.

- For **LLCM**, the citation is:
  > Zhang, Y., Yan, Y., Lu, Y., Wang, H. "Towards a unified middle modality learning for visible-infrared person re-identification." In Proceedings of the 29th ACM International Conference on Multimedia, pp. 788–796, 2021.

With this information, I will summarize the datasets and their citations clearly. 

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for easy reference and further processing.
