To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Extending Word-Level Quality Estimation for Post-Editing Assistance" by Yizhen Wei, Takehito Utsuro, and Masaaki Nagata, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions experiments on two language pairs, which suggests that datasets are involved, but I need to find their specific names and details.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the need for post-editing assistance and reference existing methods, but they do not explicitly mention datasets. I will continue to the methodology section for more details.

In **section 5 (Experiments)**, the authors state that they conducted experiments on the **En-De (English to German)** and **En-Zh (English to Chinese)** datasets from the shared task of original word-level quality estimation in WMT20. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for their experiments.

Next, I will look at the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. The paper mentions that they utilized the datasets from the WMT20 shared task, which is a well-known conference in the field of machine translation and quality estimation.

The citation for the WMT20 shared task is:
> Specia, L., Blain, F., Fomicheva, M., Fonseca, E., Chaudhary, V., Guzmán, F., & Martins, A. (2020). Findings of the WMT 2020 shared task on quality estimation. In Proceedings of the 5th WMT, pages 741–762.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citation for each dataset mentioned in the paper.

1. **En-De Dataset**: This dataset consists of 7,000 sentence pairs with annotations for training, development, and test sets used in the WMT20 quality estimation shared task.
   - Citation: Specia, L., Blain, F., Fomicheva, M., Fonseca, E., Chaudhary, V., Guzmán, F., & Martins, A. (2020). Findings of the WMT 2020 shared task on quality estimation. In Proceedings of the 5th WMT, pages 741–762.

2. **En-Zh Dataset**: Similar to the En-De dataset, this dataset also consists of 7,000 sentence pairs with annotations for the same shared task.
   - Citation: Specia, L., Blain, F., Fomicheva, M., Fonseca, E., Chaudhary, V., Guzmán, F., & Martins, A. (2020). Findings of the WMT 2020 shared task on quality estimation. In Proceedings of the 5th WMT, pages 741–762.

After gathering this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its citation.
