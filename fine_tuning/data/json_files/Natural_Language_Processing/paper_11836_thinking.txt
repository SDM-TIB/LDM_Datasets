To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Mixed Integer Programming for Time-Optimal Multi-Robot Coverage Path Planning with Efficient Heuristics" by Jingtao Tang and Hang Ma, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and it may mention datasets used for validation or comparison.

Next, I will check the **introduction** for any specific mentions of datasets. The authors often discuss related work or prior datasets that their research builds upon, which can provide valuable context.

I will then look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **experiments** where the authors might describe the datasets used in their experiments. This section typically includes details about the datasets, such as their size, characteristics, and how they were utilized in the study.

In this paper, I will specifically look for any datasets mentioned in the **experiments section**. The authors may provide details about the instances used for performance evaluation, including any specific datasets or benchmarks that were employed.

Once I identify the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, if the authors mention using a dataset like "terrain-large-1" or "terrain-large-2," I will ensure to find the original source or paper that describes these datasets and provide the full citation.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I capture all relevant datasets accurately and comprehensively.
