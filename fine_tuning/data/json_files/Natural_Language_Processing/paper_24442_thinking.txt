To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DABL: Detecting Semantic Anomalies in Business Processes Using Large Language Models" by Wei Guan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, method, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors collected **143,137 real-world process models from various domains**, which indicates a significant dataset is involved.

Next, I will focus on the **Method section**, particularly the **Dataset Preparation** subsection. Here, the authors describe how they generated normal traces from real-world process models sourced from three datasets:

1. **BPM Academic Initiative (BPMAI)**: This dataset is referenced as a source for generating normal traces. I will need to find the full citation for this dataset in the references section.

2. **Fundamentals of Business Process Management (FBPM)**: This is another dataset mentioned for generating normal traces. I will also look for its citation.

3. **SAP Signavio Academic Models (SAP-SAM)**: This dataset is the third source for generating normal traces. I will ensure to find its citation as well.

In the **Experiments section**, the authors mention that they created two test datasets (D1 and D2) from the process models, but these are derived from the original datasets mentioned above. Therefore, I will focus on the original datasets rather than the test datasets.

Now, I will check the **References section** to retrieve the full citations for each of the datasets:

- For **BPM Academic Initiative (BPMAI)**, the citation is:
  > Weske, M., Decker, G., Dumas, M., Rosa, M. L., Mendling, J., & Reijers, H. A. (2020). Model Collection of the Business Process Management Academic Initiative.

- For **Fundamentals of Business Process Management (FBPM)**, the citation is:
  > Dumas, M., Rosa, L. M., Mendling, J., & Reijers, A. H. (2018). Fundamentals of business process management. Springer.

- For **SAP Signavio Academic Models (SAP-SAM)**, the citation is:
  > Sola, D., Warmuth, C., Schäfer, B., Badakhshan, P., Rehse, J.-R., & Kampik, T. (2022). SAP Signavio Academic Models: a large process model dataset. In International Conference on Process Mining, 453–465. Springer.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
