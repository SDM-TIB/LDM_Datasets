To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Cross-Lingual Knowledge Editing in Large Language Models" by Jiaan Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and related work sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors collected a large-scale cross-lingual synthetic dataset by translating ZsRE from English to Chinese, which suggests that ZsRE is a key dataset.

Next, I will examine the **related work section** where the authors discuss various datasets used in knowledge editing. They mention several datasets, including ZsRE, COUNTERFACT, MQUAKE, and others. I will note down the names and any relevant details provided about these datasets.

In the **Bi-ZsRE section**, the authors provide specific details about the dataset they created. They describe Bi-ZsRE as a combination of the original ZsRE dataset and its translated version. They mention that ZsRE is a question answering dataset with 163,196 training samples and 19,086 validation samples. This section confirms the significance of ZsRE in their research.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to gather full citations for the datasets mentioned. The citation for ZsRE is as follows:
- ZsRE: Levy, O., Seo, M., Choi, E., & Zettlemoyer, L. (2017). *Zero-shot relation extraction via reading comprehension*. In Proceedings of the 21st Conference on Computational Natural Language Learning (CoNLL 2017), pages 333â€“342, Vancouver, Canada. Association for Computational Linguistics.

The authors also reference other datasets like COUNTERFACT and MQUAKE, but I will focus on ZsRE and Bi-ZsRE since they are central to the paper's contributions. 

For Bi-ZsRE, since it is a new dataset created by the authors, I will cite it as follows:
- Bi-ZsRE: Wang, J., Liang, Y., Sun, Z., Cao, Y., Xu, J., & Meng, F. (2023). *Cross-Lingual Knowledge Editing in Large Language Models*. [Dataset description and details provided in the paper].

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research.
