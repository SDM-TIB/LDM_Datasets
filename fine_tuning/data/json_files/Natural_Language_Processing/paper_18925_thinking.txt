To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ODIN: Disentangled Reward Mitigates Hacking in RLHF" by Lichang Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract mentions a "Human Preference Dataset," which indicates that there is at least one dataset used in the research. I will note this down for further investigation.

Next, I will look into **section 4.1 (Settings)**, where the authors describe the dataset used for their experiments. Here, they specify that they utilized the **OpenAssistant dataset**, which is a human-generated and human-annotated conversation corpus. The authors mention that it contains over 10,000 complete and fully annotated conversation trees. This is a significant dataset for their research.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the OpenAssistant dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Köpf, A., Kilcher, Y., von Rütte, D., Anagnostidis, S., Tam, Z.-R., Stevens, K., Barhoum, A. N. M. D., Stanley, O., Nagyfi, R., ES, S., Suri, S., Glushkov, D., Dantuluri, A., Maguire, A., Schuhmann, C., Nguyen, H., & Mattick, A. (2023). OpenAssistant Conversations – Democratizing Large Language Model Alignment. 

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity.

In summary, I have extracted the following dataset from the paper:

1. **OpenAssistant Dataset**: A human-generated, human-annotated conversation corpus with over 10,000 complete and fully annotated conversation trees.

The full citation for the dataset is:
> Köpf, A., Kilcher, Y., von Rütte, D., Anagnostidis, S., Tam, Z.-R., Stevens, K., Barhoum, A. N. M. D., Stanley, O., Nagyfi, R., ES, S., Suri, S., Glushkov, D., Dantuluri, A., Maguire, A., Schuhmann, C., Nguyen, H., & Mattick, A. (2023). OpenAssistant Conversations – Democratizing Large Language Model Alignment.

With this information, I am ready to present the dataset entry in the required format.
