To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Decentralized Energy Market Integrating Carbon Allowance Trade and Uncertainty Balance in Energy Communities" by Yuanxi Wu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses a joint trading framework for energy and carbon allowances, which may imply the use of specific datasets for numerical results or simulations.

Next, I will focus on the **case studies section** (Section 4) where the authors typically present the datasets used for their experiments. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, descriptions, and any relevant parameters.

In the **case parameters subsection (4.1)**, the authors provide parameters for the energy community participants, including micro-turbines and users. However, I need to check if they mention any specific datasets used for these parameters or if they reference any existing datasets.

I will also examine the **references section** to find any citations related to datasets. If the authors refer to existing datasets, I will ensure to extract the full citation for each dataset mentioned.

If the paper includes numerical results or simulations, I will look for any supplementary materials or appendices that might contain additional details about the datasets used.

Once I have identified the datasets, I will compile the full citations for each dataset. For example, if the authors reference a dataset like the "National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) Solar Radiation Database," I will ensure to include the complete citation for that dataset.

Finally, I will summarize the findings, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation, ready for further processing or review.
