To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CAPE: Camera View Position Embedding for Multi-View 3D Object Detection" by Kaixin Xiong et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that CAPE achieves state-of-the-art performance on the **nuScenes dataset**, indicating that this dataset is crucial for the research.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for any additional context or mentions of datasets. The introduction discusses the importance of 3D perception from multi-view cameras and references the nuScenes dataset again, reinforcing its significance in the experiments.

Moving on to the **experiments section**, specifically **section 4.1**, I will look for detailed descriptions of the datasets used. Here, the authors explicitly mention the **nuScenes dataset** and provide a brief overview of its composition, including the number of scenes and the type of annotations available.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the nuScenes dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:
> Holger Caesar, Varun Bankiti, Alex H Lang, Sourabh Vora, Venice Erin Liong, Qiang Xu, Anush Krishnan, Yu Pan, Giancarlo Baldan, and Oscar Beijbom. *nuScenes: A multi-modal dataset for autonomous driving*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pages 11621â€“11631, 2020.

Since the paper primarily focuses on the nuScenes dataset, I will ensure that I accurately document this dataset's details and citation.

Finally, I will compile the extracted information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation for the nuScenes dataset. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the dataset used in the research.
