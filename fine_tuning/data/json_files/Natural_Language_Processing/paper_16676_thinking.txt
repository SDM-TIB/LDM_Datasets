To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi Time Scale World Models" by Vaisakh Shaj et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the experiments focus on action conditional long-horizon future predictions and that the authors evaluate their method on several system identification benchmarks. This suggests that datasets are involved, so I need to identify them.

Next, I will look specifically at the **experiments section** (section 6), where the authors describe the datasets used. They mention three broad categories of datasets:

1. **D4RL Datasets**: This includes environments such as HalfCheetah, Medium Maze, and Franka Kitchen. The authors provide a brief description of each environment, indicating that they used a set of 3 different environments/agents from the D4RL dataset.

2. **Manipulation Datasets**: The authors describe datasets collected from a real excavator arm and a Panda robot, emphasizing the challenges posed by non-linear dynamics and the importance of accurate modeling.

3. **Mobile Robotics Dataset**: This dataset involves a simulated four-wheeled mobile robot traversing uneven terrain, which is also described in detail.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide specific details about each dataset, including the number of trajectories, the context length, and the prediction horizon. This information is crucial for understanding the datasets' characteristics.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to retrieve full citations for these datasets. The D4RL dataset is cited as follows:
- Justin Fu, Aviral Kumar, Ofir Nachum, George Tucker, and Sergey Levine. *D4RL: Datasets for Deep Data-Driven Reinforcement Learning*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2004.07219, 2020.

For the **Hydraulic Excavator** dataset, the authors do not provide a specific citation, but they describe the data collection process in detail. I will note that this dataset is based on a JCB Hydradig 110W excavator.

For the **Panda Robot** dataset, similar to the excavator dataset, there is no specific citation provided, but the authors describe the data collection process involving varying payloads.

For the **Mobile Robotics Dataset**, again, there is no specific citation, but the authors describe the dataset's characteristics and the data collection process.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for the D4RL dataset and note the descriptions for the other datasets without specific citations.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for further processing or review.
