To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Pipeline and Dataset Generation for Automated Fact-checking in Almost Any Language" by Jan Drchal et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors provide open access to data and models for multiple languages, which suggests that datasets are a key component of their work.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (QACG Models and Data)**, as it is likely to contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used in their experiments. In this section, the authors mention several datasets:

1. **SQuAD-cs**: A machine-translated Czech version of the SQuAD question answering dataset.
2. **QA2D**: A dataset aimed at training models to transform questions into declarative sentences, with machine-translated versions for Czech, Polish, and Slovak.
3. **QACG datasets**: Complete fact-checking datasets generated for all four languages (Czech, English, Polish, and Slovak).
4. **CsFEVER**: A Czech version of the FEVER dataset, which is used for fact verification tasks.
5. **EnFEVER**: The original English version of the FEVER dataset.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The citations I will extract are:

- For **SQuAD**:
  > Rajpurkar, P., Zhang, J., Lopyrev, K., Liang, P. (2016). *SQuAD: 100,000+ questions for machine comprehension of text*. In Proceedings of the 2016 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pp. 2383â€“2392. Association for Computational Linguistics.

- For **QA2D**:
  > Demszky, D., Guu, K., Liang, P. (2018). *Transforming question answering datasets into natural language inference datasets*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1809.02922.

- For **FEVER**:
  > Thorne, J., Vlachos, A., Christodoulopoulos, C., Mittal, A. (2018). *FEVER: a large-scale dataset for fact extraction and VERification*. In NAACL-HLT.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, facilitating further exploration and use by other researchers.
