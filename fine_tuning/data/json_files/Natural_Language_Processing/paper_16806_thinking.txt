To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Sig-Networks Toolkit: Signature Networks for Longitudinal Language Modelling" by Talia Tseriotou et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors showcase their toolkit on three longitudinal tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will examine **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe the tasks and datasets used. This section is likely to provide detailed information about the datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics. 

In **subsection 5.1 (Tasks and Datasets)**, the authors mention three specific datasets:

1. **TalkLife MoC**: This dataset consists of 18,702 posts from 500 user timelines, annotated for mood changes. The authors provide details about the annotation process, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's context.

2. **Anno-MI**: This dataset includes 133 motivational interviews with a total of 9,699 utterances, specifically focusing on client utterances. The authors mention that the data was sourced from effective and ineffective motivational interviewing videos, which adds to the dataset's credibility.

3. **Longitudinal Rumour Stance (LRS)**: This is a new dataset introduced in the paper, derived from the RumourEval-2017 dataset. It consists of 325 Twitter conversations with 5,568 posts, annotated for stance towards a rumourous claim. The authors explain how they adapted the original dataset for their longitudinal task.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations are essential for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

- For **TalkLife MoC**, the citation is:

- For **Anno-MI**, the citation is:

In Proceedings of the 13th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation: NAACL HLT 2019, pages 845–854. Association for Computational Linguistics.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this into a structured format for further processing or review.
