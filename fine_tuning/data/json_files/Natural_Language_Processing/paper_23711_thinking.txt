To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Boosting Robustness in Preference-Based Reinforcement Learning with Dynamic Sparsity" by Calarina Muslimani et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of preference-based reinforcement learning (PbRL) in noisy environments, which may imply the use of specific datasets for experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 5) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

In this paper, the authors mention evaluating their method in the **DeepMind Control Suite (DMC)**, which is a well-known benchmark for reinforcement learning. I will note this as a dataset used in their experiments.

I will also check the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The DMC Suite is often cited in reinforcement learning literature, so I will look for its original citation.

The citation for the DeepMind Control Suite is:
> Yuval Tassa, Yotam Doron, Alistair Muldal, Tom Erez, Yazhe Li, Diego de Las Casas, David Budden, Abbas Abdolmaleki, Josh Merel, Andrew Lefrancq, et al. *DeepMind Control Suite*. 2018. URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.00690.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in the required format for further processing or review.
