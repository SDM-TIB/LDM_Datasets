To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "Evaluation of Croatian Word Embeddings" by Luka Svoboda and Slobodan Beliga, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors created a new word analogy corpus and two word similarity corpora, which suggests that datasets are present.

Next, I will focus on the **Proposed Corpora section** (Section 2) where the authors describe the datasets in detail. Here, they mention three new datasets created for their experiments:

1. **Croatian Word2Vec Analogy Corpus**: This corpus consists of 115,085 questions divided into semantic and syntactic categories. It is based on the original Word2Vec analogy corpus and adapted for the Croatian language.

2. **Croatian WordSim353**: This dataset is a translation of the original WordSim353 dataset, containing 353 word pairs, each annotated with similarity scores on a scale from 0 to 10.

3. **Croatian RG65**: This dataset is a translation of the RG65 dataset, containing 65 word pairs, each annotated with similarity scores on a scale from 0 to 5.

In the **Conclusion section**, the authors mention that these datasets are publicly available, which confirms their significance and accessibility for further research.

Now, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for the original datasets that were translated or adapted:

- For **WordSim353**, the citation is:
  > Finkelstein, L., Gabrilovich, E., Matias, Y., Rivlin, E., Solan, Z., Wolfman, G., and Ruppin, E. (2002). Placing search in context: The concept revisited. ACM Transactions on Information Systems, 20(1):116–131.

- For **RG65**, the citation is:
  > Rubenstein, H. and Goodenough, J. B. (1965). Contextual correlates of synonymy. Communications of the ACM, 8(10):627–633, October.

Next, I will compile the extracted datasets along with their citations into a structured format for clarity and future reference.

In summary, I have identified three datasets from the paper, confirmed their details, and retrieved the necessary citations to ensure proper attribution. This process will help in documenting the datasets effectively for any further analysis or research.
