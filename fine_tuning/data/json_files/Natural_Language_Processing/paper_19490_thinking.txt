To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Novelty Detection on Radio Astronomy Data using Signatures" by Paola Arrubarrena et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract introduces the SigNova framework and mentions validating it on data from the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) telescope and simulated data. This indicates that there are datasets involved, but I need to find specific names and details.

Next, I will look into the **introduction section** where the authors discuss the challenges of radio-frequency interference (RFI) in radio astronomy. They mention using data from the MWA and the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA), which suggests these are key datasets for their experiments.

In the **results section**, the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used for validation. They mention:

1. **Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) Data**: This dataset is used for testing the SigNova framework. The authors specify that they downloaded MWA data via the All-Sky Virtual Observatory (ASVO) webpage, which includes a continuum spectrum at 167 MHz with 384 frequency channels.

2. **Simulated Data**: The authors generated synthetic data using CASA software with specific configurations, including 64 frequency channels and 50 integration times. They also mention using the ngVLA configuration file for simulating data with 214 antennas.

3. **HERA Data**: The authors refer to real data from the HERA observatory, which is used to validate the performance of SigNova against potential RFI interference.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) Data**, the citation is:
  > Tingay, S. J., Goeke, R., Bowman, J. D., Emrich, D., Ord, S. M., Mitchell, D. A., et al. (2013). *The Murchison Widefield Array: The Square Kilometre Array Precursor at Low Radio Frequencies*. Publications of the Astronomical Society of Australia, 30, e007.

- For **HERA Data**, the citation is:
  > The HERA Team. (2017). *Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA)*. Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific, 129(974), 045001.

- For the **simulated data**, the citation is:
  > CASA Team. (2022). *CASA, the Common Astronomy Software Applications for Radio Astronomy*. Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific, 134(1041), 114501.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all relevant details are captured for future reference or analysis.
