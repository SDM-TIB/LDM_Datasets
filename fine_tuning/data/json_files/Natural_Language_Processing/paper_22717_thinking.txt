To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Lag Selection for Univariate Time Series Forecasting using Deep Learning: An Empirical Study" by JosÃ© Leites et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and materials and methods sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the experiments were conducted using **three benchmark databases** containing a total of **2411 univariate time series**, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Materials and Methods)**, specifically **subsection 3.1 (Data)**, where the authors provide details about the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention three specific datasets:

1. **M1 Dataset**: This dataset is part of a forecasting competition and contains monthly time series data. It has an average length of 72.7, with a total of 617 time series and 44,892 observations.

2. **M3 Dataset**: Another dataset from a forecasting competition, it has an average length of 117.3, comprising 1428 time series and 167,562 observations.

3. **Tourism Dataset**: This dataset also comes from a forecasting competition, with an average length of 298.5, consisting of 366 time series and 109,280 observations.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for their experiments, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. However, the paper does not provide specific citations for the datasets themselves, as they are well-known benchmark datasets in the forecasting community. Therefore, I will provide general references for these datasets based on common knowledge:

- **M1 Dataset**: 
  > Makridakis, S., Andersen, A., Carbone, R., Fildes, R., Hibon, M., Lewandowski, R., Newton, J., Parzen, E., & Winkler, R. (1982). The accuracy of extrapolation (time series) methods: Results of a forecasting competition. *Journal of Forecasting*, 1(2), 111-153.

- **M3 Dataset**: 
  > Makridakis, S., & Hibon, M. (2000). The M3-Competition: Results, conclusions and implications. *International Journal of Forecasting*, 16(4), 451-476.

- **Tourism Dataset**: 
  > Athanasopoulos, G., Hyndman, R.J., Song, H., & Wu, D.C. (2011). The tourism forecasting competition. *International Journal of Forecasting*, 27(3), 822-844.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented and properly cited.
