To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "Multimodal Learning and Cognitive Processes in Radiology: MedGaze for Chest X-ray Scanpath Prediction" by Akash Awasthi et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study utilizes publicly available datasets, which is a good starting point.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of modeling gaze behavior in medical imaging and hint at the datasets used for training their model. However, I need to look for specific dataset names.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used. They refer to two datasets: **REFLACX** and **EGD-CXR**. The paper describes these datasets as containing CXR images with synchronized eye-tracking and transcription pairs, annotated by different radiologists. This section provides crucial details about the datasets' purpose and structure.

I will also check the **results section** to confirm that these datasets were indeed used for evaluation and to see if any performance metrics are reported for each dataset. The authors mention that MedGaze outperformed the state-of-the-art methods on both datasets, which reinforces their significance in the study.

Now, I will consult the **references section** to gather the full citations for each dataset:

1. For **REFLACX**, the citation is:
   > Bigolin Lanfredi, R., Zhang, M., Auffermann, W.F., Chan, J., Duong, P.A.T., Srikumar, V., Drew, T., Schroeder, J.D. and Tasdizen, T. (2022). REFLACX, a dataset of reports and eye-tracking data for localization of abnormalities in chest x-rays. *Scientific Data*, 9(1), p.350.

2. For **EGD-CXR**, the citation is:
   > Karargyris, A., Kashyap, S., Lourentzou, I., Wu, J.T., Sharma, A., Tong, M., Abedin, S., Beymer, D., Mukherjee, V. and Krupinski, E.A. (2021). Creation and validation of a chest X-ray dataset with eye-tracking and report dictation for AI development. *Scientific Data*, 8(1), p. 92.

With the dataset names and their citations identified, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the study along with their proper citations.
