To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Meek Separators and Their Applications in Targeted Causal Discovery" by Kirankumar Shiragur, Jiaqi Zhang, and Caroline Uhler, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the introduction of the Meek separator and its applications, but does not specify any datasets. I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** to identify any datasets used for empirical validation. This section typically contains detailed descriptions of the datasets employed in the experiments. If the authors mention specific datasets, I will note their names and any relevant details provided.

In the **results section**, I will look for any references to datasets used for evaluation. The authors may discuss the performance of their methods on specific datasets, which would be crucial for my extraction.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is essential for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets.

If the paper mentions datasets such as "Erdös-Rényi graphs" or "Barabási–Albert graphs," I will ensure to document them correctly. For example, if the authors refer to a specific dataset from a previous study, I will include the citation for that study as well.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.

Finally, I will format the extracted information clearly and concisely, ready for any further processing or review.
