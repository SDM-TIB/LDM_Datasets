To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Grip force as a functional window to somatosensory cognition" by Birgitta Dresp-Langley, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any references to datasets or data collection methods. The abstract discusses the analysis of grip force signals and mentions the use of wireless monitoring technology, which suggests that there may be datasets related to grip force measurements.

Next, I will examine the **methods** or **experiments** sections of the paper, as these typically provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the research. I will look for any specific datasets mentioned, including their names, sizes, and the context in which they were used.

In this paper, the author discusses the use of a **wireless sensor glove hardware-software system** for collecting grip force data. I will note this as a potential dataset, but I need to find more specific details about it.

I will also check the **results** and **discussion** sections for any additional mentions of datasets or data analysis techniques. The author may refer to specific datasets when discussing findings or comparing results with previous studies.

Finally, I will consult the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned in the paper. If the datasets are derived from other studies, I will ensure to include those original sources.

Based on my reading, I will compile the following datasets:

1. **Grip Force Dataset**: This dataset is derived from the wireless sensor glove system used to monitor grip force during various tasks. The paper does not provide a specific citation for this dataset, but it references the work of de Mathelin et al. (2019) for the sensor technology.

   Citation:
   > de Mathelin M, Nageotte F, Zanne P, Dresp-Langley B. Sensors for expert grip force profiling: Towards benchmarking manual control of a robotic device for surgical tool movements. Sensors 2019; 19:4575.

2. **Multi-Finger Grip Force Data**: The paper discusses the collection of grip force data from multiple fingers during various tasks, which may not be a standalone dataset but is part of the overall grip force dataset mentioned above.

3. **Comparative Grip Force Data**: The author compares grip force profiles between novices and experts, which may involve datasets from previous studies referenced throughout the paper.

I will ensure to document each dataset with its full citation, as it is crucial for proper attribution and further research.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for review or further processing.
