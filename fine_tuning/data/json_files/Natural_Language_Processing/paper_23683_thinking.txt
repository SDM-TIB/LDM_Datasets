To extract datasets from the research paper titled "I-SIRCH: AI-Powered Concept Annotation Tool for Equitable Extraction and Analysis of Safety Insights from Maternity Investigations" by Mohit Kumar Singh et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study and may mention key datasets used for training or testing the I-SIRch framework.

Next, I will focus on the **Methods section**, particularly the part that discusses the data preparation stage. Here, the authors describe the datasets used for training and testing the I-SIRch model. They mention that the model was trained on **76 real maternity investigation reports** provided by the Healthcare Safety Investigation Branch (HSIB) and tested on additional datasets.

In the **Results section**, the authors provide detailed statistics about the datasets, including the number of reports and the concepts annotated. They mention that the reports were written between 2019 and 2022, and I will note the specific batches of data used for training and testing.

The paper outlines the following datasets:

1. **Batch 1**: 76 real maternity investigation reports used for training the model.
2. **Batch 2**: 15 real maternity investigation reports used for further training.
3. **Batch 3**: 97 real maternity investigation reports used for testing.
4. **Batch 4**: 818 synthetic sentences generated for testing the model.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The authors reference the HSIB as the source of the real maternity investigation reports, but I will also look for any additional references that may provide context or details about the datasets.

The citation for the HSIB reports is:
> Healthcare Safety Investigation Branch (HSIB). *Investigations and Reports*. Available at: https://www.hsib.org.uk/investigations-and-reports/

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for further processing or review.
