To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Measuring and Controlling Divisiveness in Rank Aggregation" by Rachael Colley et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on divisiveness measures, but it does not mention specific datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine the **related work and experiments sections**. These sections often contain references to datasets used in the study. I will look for any mentions of datasets, including their names, descriptions, and how they were utilized in the research.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors reference a dataset called **PrefLib**, which is used for generating preference profiles in their experiments. This dataset is crucial for understanding the context of their research.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the PrefLib dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Nicholas Mattei and Toby Walsh. *Preflib: A library of preference data*. In Proceedings of the 3rd International Conference on Algorithmic Decision Theory (ADT), 2013. Available at: http://preflib.org.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the PrefLib dataset.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for PrefLib, ensuring that it is clear and concise, ready for any further processing or review.
