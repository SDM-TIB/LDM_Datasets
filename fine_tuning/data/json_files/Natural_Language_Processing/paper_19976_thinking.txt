To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Adversarial MDPs with Stochastic Hard Constraints" by Francesco Emanuele Stradi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, but it may not detail specific datasets. The introduction often discusses related work and may reference datasets used in prior studies.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **experiments**. In many research papers, authors will describe the datasets they used for their experiments in a specific section, often labeled as "Datasets" or "Experimental Setup." This section typically includes details about the datasets, such as their names, sizes, and characteristics.

If the paper includes a **results or experiments section**, I will check there as well, as authors often mention the datasets again when discussing their findings or results.

Once I identify any datasets, I will ensure to note down their names and any relevant details provided in the paper. I will also check the **References section** for full citations of the datasets. This is crucial, as proper citation is necessary for academic integrity and allows others to locate the datasets.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like "XYZ Dataset," I will look for its citation in the references. If the dataset is not directly cited, I will note the original source if it is mentioned in the text.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described, including its name, a brief description, and the full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.

In summary, my steps will be:
1. Read the abstract, introduction, and methodology sections for mentions of datasets.
2. Look for a dedicated section on datasets or experiments.
3. Note down the names and details of any identified datasets.
4. Check the references for full citations of the datasets.
5. Compile the information into a structured format with clear descriptions and citations for each dataset.
