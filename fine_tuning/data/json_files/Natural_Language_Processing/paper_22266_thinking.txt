To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fast TILs estimation in lung cancer WSIs based on semi-stochastic patch sampling" by Nikita Shvetsov et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's purpose and methods, which may hint at the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the significance of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and the challenges of manual quantification. This section may not directly mention datasets but sets the context for their use.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Methods)**, particularly **subsection 2.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets utilized in their study. Here, they mention two primary datasets:

1. **WSI dataset**: This dataset consists of whole slide images (WSIs) from 553 NSCLC patients treated at specific hospitals. It includes clinical information and details about the tissue samples, with 497 WSIs available for analysis.

2. **Patch dataset**: This secondary dataset is composed of randomly selected patches from a subset of 194 WSIs, combined with patches from the LC25000 dataset. The authors detail the composition of this dataset, including the number of patches per class (necrosis, stroma, normal lung, and tumor tissue).

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The relevant citations are:

- For the **LC25000 dataset**:
  > A. A. Borkowski, M. M. Bui, L. B. Thomas, C. P. Wilson, L. A. DeLand, and S. M. Mastorides. *Lung and Colon Cancer Histopathological Image Dataset (LC25000)*. 2019.

- For the **WSI dataset**, since it is derived from clinical data and does not have a specific citation, I will note that it is based on previously documented cohorts, specifically referencing the work by Kilvaer et al. (2020):
  > T. K. Kilvaer et al. *Digitally quantified CD8+ cells: the best candidate marker for an immune cell score in non-small cell lung cancer?* Carcinogenesis, vol. 41, no. 12, pp. 1671â€“1681, 2020.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant information regarding the datasets used in the study.
