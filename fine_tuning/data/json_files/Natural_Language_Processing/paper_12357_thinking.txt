To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Topics, Authors, and Institutions in Large Language Model Research: Trends from 17K arXiv Papers" by Rajiv Movva et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions analyzing a dataset of **16,979 LLM-related arXiv papers**, which indicates that a dataset is indeed present.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **methods section**, where the authors describe their data collection process. They state that they collected **arXiv metadata** for all papers posted to the CS and Stat arXivs from January 1, 2018, to September 7, 2023, resulting in a total of **418K papers**. However, they filtered this down to **16,979 LLM-related papers** based on specific keywords.

In the **appendix**, particularly in section A.1, the authors detail their methodology for identifying LLM-related papers, which includes a list of keywords used for filtering. This section confirms that the dataset is derived from a larger corpus of arXiv papers.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The authors do not provide a specific citation for the dataset itself, as it is based on publicly available arXiv data. However, I can cite the arXiv dataset as follows:

- For the arXiv dataset, the citation is:
  > Team Kaggle. *Leveraging ML to Fuel New Discoveries with the arXiv Dataset*. 2020. Available at: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arxiv.

Since the dataset is based on arXiv papers, I will also note that the authors made their data and code publicly available, which is important for reproducibility.

Finally, I will summarize the findings regarding the datasets in a structured manner, ensuring that I include the full citation for the arXiv dataset as it is the primary dataset referenced in the paper.

After compiling this information, I will be ready to present the dataset entries in the required format for further processing or review.
