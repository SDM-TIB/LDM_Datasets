To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Black-box Approach for Non-stationary Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning" by Haozhe Jiang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, and the introduction often outlines the context and previous work, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments or results sections**. This is typically where authors describe the datasets used for their experiments, including their characteristics and relevance to the study.

In this paper, I will specifically check for any references to datasets used in the context of multi-agent reinforcement learning or any benchmarks that the authors might have utilized. If the authors mention specific datasets, I will take note of their names, descriptions, and any relevant details such as the number of samples, types of tasks, or specific characteristics that define the datasets.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

For example, if the authors mention a dataset like "OpenAI Gym" or "StarCraft II," I will look for the corresponding citation in the references. If the dataset is not directly cited, I will search for the original papers or sources that introduced the dataset to ensure accurate citation.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation in the appropriate format.

Finally, I will ensure that all extracted information is organized and ready for presentation or further analysis, maintaining clarity and accuracy throughout the process.
