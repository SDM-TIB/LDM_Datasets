To extract datasets from the research paper titled "centroIDA: Cross-Domain Class Discrepancy Minimization Based on Accumulative Class-Centroids for Imbalanced Domain Adaptation," I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **experiments section**, the authors explicitly mention two datasets used for evaluation: **Office-Home** and **Domain-Net**. I will take note of the details provided about these datasets, including their characteristics and how they were utilized in the experiments.

Next, I will look for any specific details about the datasets in the **methodology section**. Here, the authors describe the sampling protocol and the imbalanced ratios applied to the Office-Home dataset, which is crucial for understanding how the datasets were manipulated for the experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. This is essential for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets.

For the **Office-Home dataset**, the citation is:
> Venkateswara, H., Eusebio, J., Chakraborty, S., & Panchanathan, S. (2017). *Deep hashing network for unsupervised domain adaptation*. In Proceedings of the IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition (CVPR), 5018–5027.

For the **Domain-Net dataset**, the citation is:
> Peng, X., Bai, Q., Xia, X., Huang, Z., Saenko, K., & Wang, B. (2019). *Moment matching for multi-source domain adaptation*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF international conference on computer vision (ICCV), 1406–1415.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
