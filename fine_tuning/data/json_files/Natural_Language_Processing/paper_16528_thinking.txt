To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Evolutionary accessibility of random and structured fitness landscapes" by Joachim Krug and Daniel Oros, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. These sections often provide a summary of the research and may mention specific datasets used in the study. I will look for any explicit references to datasets or experiments that involve data collection.

Next, I will examine the **methods** and **results** sections, as these typically contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the experiments. I will pay close attention to any subsections that might be dedicated to datasets, such as "Data Collection" or "Experimental Datasets." Here, I will look for specific names of datasets, their sizes, and any relevant characteristics that describe their content.

In the **discussion** section, the authors may also refer to datasets when discussing the implications of their findings or comparing their results to previous studies. I will note any additional datasets mentioned here.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** of the paper to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily. I will look for papers or sources that describe the datasets in detail.

For example, if the authors mention using the "Penn Action Dataset," I will find the corresponding citation in the references. I will do the same for any other datasets mentioned, ensuring I capture the complete citation format as required.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, into a structured format for easy reference.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets used in the research paper, along with their proper citations.
