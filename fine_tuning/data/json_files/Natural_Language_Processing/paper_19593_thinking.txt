To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Probing Multimodal Large Language Models for Global and Local Semantic Representations" by Mingxu Tao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to look for any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the use of image-caption datasets for training MLLMs, which indicates that datasets are likely discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Global Multimodal Representation)**, where the authors describe building a dataset based on **MS COCO**. They mention that this dataset contains over 200,000 labeled images, each with five captions. This is a clear identification of a dataset used in their experiments.

In **section 4 (Local Multimodal Representation)**, the authors again refer to the **MS COCO dataset** for conducting an object recognition task. They specify that this dataset includes annotations for 80 distinct object categories, further confirming its relevance.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the **MS COCO dataset**. The citation is as follows:
- **MS COCO**: 
  > Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, Serge J. Belongie, Lubomir D. Bourdev, Ross B. Girshick, James Hays, Pietro Perona, Deva Ramanan, Piotr Doll√°r, and C. Lawrence Zitnick. *Microsoft COCO: common objects in context*. CoRR, abs/1405.0312, 2014.

Since the paper primarily discusses the **MS COCO dataset**, I will document this dataset with its full citation.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format for clarity and future reference, ensuring that the citation is included accurately.
