To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Neural Garment Dynamics via Manifold-Aware Transformers" by Peizhuo Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the work, and the introduction often highlights the datasets used for evaluation or training.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss their approach and mention the use of a dataset for training their model. Specifically, they state that they train their model with the **CLOTH3D dataset**, which contains various garment categories and is crucial for their experiments.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** to gather more details about the datasets. The authors specify that they randomly selected 200 simulated sequences from the CLOTH3D dataset, which includes 7 categories of garments. This confirms the dataset's relevance and its application in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the CLOTH3D dataset. The citation provided in the references is:

- For **CLOTH3D dataset**:
  > Bertiche, Hugo, Madadi, Meysam, and Escalera, Sergio. "CLOTH3D: clothed 3D humans." Computer Vision–ECCV 2020: 16th European Conference, Glasgow, UK, August 23–28, 2020, Proceedings, Part XX 16. Springer, 2020, 344–359.

Additionally, the authors mention using the **CMU human motion dataset** for animating the body in their experiments. I will also extract this dataset's citation from the references:

- For **CMU human motion dataset**:
  > CMU. CMU Graphics Lab Motion Capture Database. May 2019. URL: http://mocap.cs.cmu.edu/.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets extracted from the paper:

1. **CLOTH3D dataset**: Used for training the model, containing various garment categories and simulated sequences.
2. **CMU human motion dataset**: Used for animating the body in the experiments.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations as required.
