To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Using Large Language Model to Solve and Explain Physics Word Problems" by Jingzhe Ding et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information accurately, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the creation of a dataset called **PhysQA**, which contains over 1000 junior high school physics word problems. This indicates that there is a specific dataset that I need to focus on.

Next, I will look into **section 3 (Dataset)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the PhysQA dataset. They describe how they collected and annotated 1008 distinct junior high school physics word problems, which encompass a total of 1770 sub-questions. This section will provide me with the necessary details about the dataset's composition, including its structure and the types of problems it contains.

In **section 3.1**, the authors explain the process of gathering problems from various educational websites and standardizing their format. They emphasize that this dataset is the first of its kind, specifically designed for physics word problems, which is crucial for my extraction.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the PhysQA dataset. Since the dataset is newly created by the authors, it may not have a separate citation in the traditional sense. However, I will cite the paper itself as the source of the dataset:

- For **PhysQA Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Jingzhe Ding, Yan Cen, and Xinyuan Wei. *Using Large Language Model to Solve and Explain Physics Word Problems*. In Proceedings of the [Conference Name], [Year], [Pages].

Since the paper does not specify a conference name or year in the provided text, I will note that these details need to be filled in based on the actual publication information.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry for PhysQA, ensuring that I include the dataset's name, description, and the citation in a clear and structured manner.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for review or further processing, ensuring that all necessary details are included and accurately represented.
