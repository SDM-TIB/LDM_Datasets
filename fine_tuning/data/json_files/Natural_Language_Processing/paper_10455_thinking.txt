To extract datasets from the research paper titled "IMAGINATOR: Pre-Trained Image+Text Joint Embeddings using Word-Level Grounding of Images" by Varuna Krishna et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors trained their model on "21K distinct image objects level from 1M image+text pairs," which suggests that there are datasets involved, but I need to find their specific names.

Next, I will examine the **methodology and experiments sections** to look for explicit mentions of datasets. In section 3.1.1, the authors reference **Flickr30k** and **COCO** datasets, stating that these datasets have a limited number of objects. This is a clear indication that these datasets are relevant to their work.

In section 5.2, the authors mention evaluating their model on **Caltech 101**, **Flickr 30k**, **MS COCO**, **Google CC**, and **Visual Genome** datasets for image similarity tasks. This confirms that these datasets are used in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to gather full citations for each dataset mentioned:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
