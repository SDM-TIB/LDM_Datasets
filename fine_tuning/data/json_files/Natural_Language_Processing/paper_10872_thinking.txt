To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Closing the Gap in High-Risk Pregnancy Care Using Machine Learning and Human-AI Collaboration" by Hussein Mozannar et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a summary of the study's objectives and methods, which may include mentions of datasets used. In the introduction, the authors often discuss the context and significance of their work, which may lead to the identification of specific datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly the subsections that describe dataset creation and model training. In this paper, the authors mention constructing datasets from claims data of a health insurance company. I will look for specific details about the datasets, such as the number of patients, the features included, and any specific cohorts defined.

In the **results section**, I will check for any references to the datasets used in the analysis, including performance metrics that may indicate the datasets' characteristics. The authors may also discuss the datasets in the context of their findings, which can provide additional insights.

From my reading, I identify two main datasets mentioned:

1. **Identification Dataset**: This dataset consists of 36,735 female patients aged 18 to 48 who had pregnancies with and without complications between 2004 to 2021. It includes features such as medical conditions, prescriptions, and demographic information.

2. **Complications Dataset**: This dataset includes 12,243 patients, with a focus on those who experienced gestational diabetes or gestational hypertension. It contains temporal and non-temporal features, similar to the Identification Dataset.

Next, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for any datasets or algorithms referenced in the paper. The authors may cite foundational works or datasets that informed their methodology.

For the **Identification Dataset**, the citation is:
> Matcho, A. et al. *Inferring pregnancy episodes and outcomes within a network of observational databases*. PLoS ONE, 13, e0192033, DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0192033 (2018).

For the **Complications Dataset**, the citation is:
> Bertini, A. et al. *Using machine learning to predict complications in pregnancy: A systematic review*. Front. bioengineering biotechnology, 9, 1385 (2022).

Finally, I will compile the extracted datasets and their citations into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the necessary information for each dataset mentioned in the paper.
