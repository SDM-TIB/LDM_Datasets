To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Masked Generative Video-to-Audio Transformers with Enhanced Synchronicity" by Santiago Pascual et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the use of a dataset for training, which is a good starting point.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly discuss the datasets used. Here, they mention the **VGGSound dataset** as the primary dataset for training their models. The authors describe it as containing videos curated to maximize audio-visual correspondence, which is essential for their video-to-audio generation task.

I will also look for any additional datasets mentioned in the context of testing or evaluation. The authors refer to three test partitions derived from the VGGSound dataset, including a specific subset for evaluating temporal alignment, but they do not introduce any new datasets beyond VGGSound.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the VGGSound dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:

- For **VGGSound dataset**:
  > Chen, H., Xie, W., Vedaldi, A., Zisserman, A. (2020). VGGSound: A large-scale audio-visual dataset. In ICASSP 2020-2020 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP). pp. 721â€“725. IEEE.

Since this is the only dataset mentioned in the context of their experiments, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity.

Finally, I will ensure that I have accurately captured the dataset name, description, and full citation, ready for any further processing or review.
