To extract datasets from the research paper titled "G-TRACER: Expected Sharpness Optimization" by John Williams and Stephen Roberts, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the performance of G-TRACER on benchmark datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments** section. In this paper, the authors mention using benchmark datasets for evaluation, which is a strong indicator that specific datasets will be listed.

Upon reviewing the **experiments section**, I find that the authors mention using the **CIFAR-100 dataset** for their computer vision experiments and the **SuperGlue benchmark** for NLP tasks. I will note these datasets down for further details.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. **CIFAR-100 Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical Report, 2009. URL: https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html.

2. **SuperGlue Benchmark**: The citation is:
   > Minjoon Seo, Aniruddha Kembhavi, Ali Farhadi, and Mohammad Rastegari. *Bidirectional Attention Flow for Machine Comprehension*. In Proceedings of the 2017 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 221â€“231, 2017. URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01603.

With these citations in hand, I will compile the dataset information, ensuring that I include the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations as required.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in the specified format, ensuring clarity and completeness for each dataset extracted from the paper.
