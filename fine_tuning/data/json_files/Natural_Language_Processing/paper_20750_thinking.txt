To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Uncovering Selective State Space Model’s Capabilities in Lifelong Sequential Recommendation" by Jiyuan Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on two real-world datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section, where the authors discuss the challenges of sequential recommendation and the importance of modeling long user interaction sequences. They mention the need for datasets that reflect lifelong user interests, which reinforces the expectation that datasets will be specified in the subsequent sections.

I will then focus on the **experiments section**, particularly **section 3.2 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they describe two datasets:

1. **KuaiRand**: This dataset is derived from the micro-video platform Kuaishou, containing 27,285 users, 32,038,725 videos, and an average interaction length of 11,811. The authors highlight its unique feature of including randomly exposed items to ensure unbiased recommendations.

2. **LFM-1b**: This dataset is from the music platform Last.FM, comprising over one billion music-listening interactions, 31,634,450 music items, and a total of 120,322 user clicks, with an average interaction length of 9,043.

To confirm the details, I will check the **references section** for full citations of these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **KuaiRand**, the citation is:
  > Chongming Gao, Shijun Li, Yuan Zhang, Jiawei Chen, Biao Li, Wenqiang Lei, Peng Jiang, and Xiangnan He. *KuaiRand: An Unbiased Sequential Recommendation Dataset with Randomly Exposed Videos*. In Proceedings of the 31st ACM International Conference on Information & Knowledge Management (CIKM ’22), pages 3953–3957, 2022. https://doi.org/10.1145/3511808.3557624

- For **LFM-1b**, the citation is:
  > Markus Schedl. *The lfm-1b dataset for music retrieval and recommendation*. In Proceedings of the 2016 ACM on International Conference on Multimedia Retrieval, pages 103–110, 2016.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
