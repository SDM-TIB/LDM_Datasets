To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ReactionT5: a large-scale pre-trained model towards application of limited reaction data" by Tatsuya Sagawa and Ryosuke Kojima, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and datasets sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of the **Open Reaction Database (ORD)** for pretraining, which indicates that this is a significant dataset. I will also look for any other datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges in organic chemistry and the importance of large-scale datasets for training models. This section may provide context for the datasets used but may not explicitly name them.

Next, I will focus on the **datasets section** of the paper, which is likely to contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used. Here, the authors mention two primary datasets:

1. **ZINC Database**: This is a compound library containing 23 million compounds represented in the SMILES format. It is used for the compound pretraining stage of the ReactionT5 model.

2. **Open Reaction Database (ORD)**: This dataset consists of 1.5 million reactions and is used for the reaction pretraining stage. The authors emphasize that the ORD aggregates a wide range of reaction data, making it suitable for their model.

Additionally, the paper mentions the **USPTO dataset** for product prediction, which is based on Lowe’s patent data and contains 479,000 reaction data points. This dataset is split into training, validation, and test sets.

For yield prediction, the authors utilize the **palladium-catalyzed Buchwald-Hartwig C-N cross-coupling reactions dataset**, which contains 3,955 reactions.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **ZINC Database**, the citation is:
  > Irwin, J. J.; Tang, K. G.; Young, J.; Dandarchuluun, C.; Wong, B. R.; Khurelbaatar, M.; Moroz, Y. S.; Mayfield, J.; Sayle, R. A. ZINC20—a free ultralarge-scale chemical database for ligand discovery. *Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling* 2020, 60, 6065–6073.

- For the **Open Reaction Database (ORD)**, the citation is:
  > Kearnes, S. M.; Maser, M. R.; Wleklinski, M.; Kast, A.; Doyle, A. G.; Dreher, S. D.; Hawkins, J. M.; Jensen, K. F.; Coley, C. W. The Open Reaction Database. *Journal of the American Chemical Society* 2021, 143, 18820–18826.

- For the **USPTO dataset**, the citation is:
  > Lowe, D. M. Extraction of chemical structures and reactions from the literature. 2012.

- For the **palladium-catalyzed Buchwald-Hartwig C-N cross-coupling reactions dataset**, the citation is:
  > Ahneman, D. T.; Estrada, J. G.; Lin, S.; Dreher, S. D.; Doyle, A. G. Predicting reaction performance in C–N cross-coupling using machine learning. *Science* 2018, 360, 186–190.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
