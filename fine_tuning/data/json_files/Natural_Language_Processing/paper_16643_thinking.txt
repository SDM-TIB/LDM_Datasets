To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Local monotone operator learning using non-monotone operators: MnM-MOL" by Maneesh John et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the recovery of magnetic resonance (MR) images and indicates that the authors used specific datasets for their experiments. This suggests that there are datasets to identify.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section IV), where the authors describe the datasets used for their evaluations. Here, they mention two specific datasets:

1. **Calgary-Campinas Public (CCP) dataset**: This dataset consists of T1-weighted multi-coil brain scans from 117 healthy subjects, collected on a 3.0 Tesla MRI scanner. The authors provide details about the scan parameters and how they selected a subset for their experiments.

2. **fastMRI dataset**: This dataset includes multichannel knee data from the fastMRI challenge, which consists of 15-coil coronal proton-density weighted knee images. The authors describe the sequence parameters and how they used the k-space measurements for training and testing.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **Calgary-Campinas Public (CCP) dataset**, the citation is:
  > R. Souza et al., “An open, multi-vendor, multi-field-strength brain MR dataset and analysis of publicly available skull stripping methods agreement,” *NeuroImage*, vol. 170, pp. 482–494, 2018.

- For the **fastMRI dataset**, the citation is:
  > J. Zbontar et al., “fastMRI: An open dataset and benchmarks for accelerated MRI,” arXiv preprint arXiv:1811.08839, 2018.

Now that I have the dataset names and their corresponding citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their proper citations.
