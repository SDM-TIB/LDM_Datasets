To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Tracking the Newsworthiness of Public Documents" by Alexander Spangher et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors gathered a large multimodal dataset of policy proposals, news articles, and meeting recordings, which suggests that there are specific datasets to extract.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Policy Item â†” Article Linking)**, particularly **subsection 2.1 (Corpora)**, where the authors describe the datasets they collected. Here, they mention:

1. **SFBOS Policy Proposals Dataset**: This dataset consists of 13,089 policy proposals from the San Francisco Board of Supervisors (SFBOS) spanning 10 years. It includes details about how many times each proposal was discussed in public meetings.

2. **SFChron News Articles Dataset**: This dataset contains 202,644 news articles from the San Francisco Chronicle published between 2013 and 2023. The authors collected these articles to analyze their coverage of local policy.

3. **SFBOS Meeting Video Dataset**: The authors collected 3,400 hours of video recordings of SFBOS meetings, which they transcribed and diarized for analysis.

In **section 3 (Newsworthiness Prediction)**, the authors discuss how they used the linked datasets to predict newsworthiness, but they do not introduce any new datasets here.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. However, since the datasets are primarily derived from the authors' own collection efforts and not from previously published works, there may not be formal citations for them. Instead, I will summarize the datasets based on the information provided in the paper.

The datasets can be summarized as follows:

1. **SFBOS Policy Proposals Dataset**: 
   - Description: A dataset of 13,089 policy proposals from the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, spanning 10 years.
   - Citation: Not applicable (original dataset collected by the authors).

2. **SFChron News Articles Dataset**: 
   - Description: A dataset of 202,644 news articles from the San Francisco Chronicle published between 2013 and 2023.
   - Citation: Not applicable (original dataset collected by the authors).

3. **SFBOS Meeting Video Dataset**: 
   - Description: A dataset containing 3,400 hours of video recordings of SFBOS meetings, which were transcribed and diarized.
   - Citation: Not applicable (original dataset collected by the authors).

After compiling this information, I will ensure that I have accurately captured the essence of each dataset and its relevance to the research conducted in the paper. This will provide a clear overview of the datasets used in the study, even if they do not have formal citations like traditional datasets might.
