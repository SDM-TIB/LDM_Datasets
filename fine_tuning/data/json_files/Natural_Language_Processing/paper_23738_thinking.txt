To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-Prompting Decoder Helps Better Language Understanding" by Zifeng Cheng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple natural language understanding datasets, which indicates that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically **Table II**, which provides statistics of the datasets used in the experiments. This table lists several datasets along with their respective tasks, number of classes, and the number of test samples.

The datasets identified in the paper are:

1. **SST2**: A sentiment analysis dataset with 2 classes and 872 test samples.
2. **IMDB**: Another sentiment analysis dataset with 2 classes and 25,000 test samples.
3. **Yelp**: A sentiment analysis dataset with 2 classes and 38,000 test samples.
4. **AG’s News**: A topic classification dataset with 4 classes and 7,600 test samples.
5. **Yahoo**: A topic classification dataset with 10 classes and 60,000 test samples.
6. **DBPedia**: A topic classification dataset with 14 classes and 70,000 test samples.
7. **RTE**: A natural language inference dataset with 2 classes and 277 test samples.
8. **SNLI**: A natural language inference dataset with 3 classes and 9,842 test samples.
9. **MNLI-m**: A natural language inference dataset with 3 classes and 9,815 test samples.
10. **MNLI-mm**: Another version of the MNLI dataset with 3 classes and 9,832 test samples.

Now, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

With this information, I can now compile the dataset entries with their full citations for further processing.
