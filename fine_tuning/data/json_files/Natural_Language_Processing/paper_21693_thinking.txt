To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Factorized Motion Fields for Fast Sparse Input Dynamic View Synthesis" by Nagabhushan Somraj et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors evaluate their model on "popular multi-view dynamic scene datasets," which indicates that datasets are indeed involved.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. In section 4.1, the authors explicitly mention two datasets used for evaluation:

1. **N3DV Dataset**: This dataset is referenced as a popular multi-view dynamic scene dataset, which contains six real-world scenes with multiple static cameras and a specific number of frames per viewpoint.

2. **InterDigital Dataset**: This dataset is also mentioned as another popular multi-view dynamic scene dataset, containing multiple real-world scenes with varying numbers of frames.

To ensure I have the full citations for these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **N3DV Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Li, T., Slavcheva, M., Zollhöfer, M., et al. (2022). *Neural 3D Video Synthesis From Multi-View Video*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR).

- For the **InterDigital Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Sabater, N., Boisson, G., Vandame, B., et al. (2017). *Dataset and Pipeline for Multi-View Light-Field Video*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR) Workshop.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will summarize the findings:

1. **N3DV Dataset**: A multi-view dynamic scene dataset used for evaluating the model.
   - Citation: Li, T., Slavcheva, M., Zollhöfer, M., et al. (2022). *Neural 3D Video Synthesis From Multi-View Video*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR).

2. **InterDigital Dataset**: Another multi-view dynamic scene dataset utilized in the experiments.
   - Citation: Sabater, N., Boisson, G., Vandame, B., et al. (2017). *Dataset and Pipeline for Multi-View Light-Field Video*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR) Workshop.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
