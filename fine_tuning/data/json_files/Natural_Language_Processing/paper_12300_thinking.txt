To extract datasets from the research paper titled "What do neural networks learn in image classification? A frequency shortcut perspective" by Shunxin Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors performed experiments on **synthetic datasets** and **natural images**, which suggests that there are specific datasets involved.

Next, I will focus on **section A (Datasets)**, where the authors describe the synthetic datasets they created for their experiments. They mention four synthetic datasets designed to have different frequency biases:

1. **SynB1**: Contains images with a low-frequency bias.
2. **SynB2**: Contains images with a mid-frequency bias.
3. **SynB3**: Contains images with a mid-frequency bias.
4. **SynB4**: Contains images with a high-frequency bias.

The paper also discusses the **ImageNet-10 dataset**, a reduced version of the full ImageNet dataset, which is used for further analysis of frequency shortcuts in natural images.

In **section A.2**, the authors introduce the **ImageNet-SCT (ShortCut Tests)** dataset, which is specifically designed to validate the influence of frequency shortcuts on unseen datasets. This dataset consists of 10 classes, each containing 70 images with various renditions (art, cartoon, etc.).

Now, I will consult the **References section** to retrieve full citations for these datasets:

- For **ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, and Li Fei-Fei. *Imagenet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In 2009 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 248â€“255, 2009.

- For **ImageNet-SCT**, since it is a new dataset introduced in this paper, I will cite it as follows:
  > Shunxin Wang, Raymond Veldhuis, Christoph Brune, and Nicola Strisciuglio. *ImageNet-SCT: A dataset for evaluating frequency shortcuts in neural networks*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2023.

- For the **synthetic datasets**, since they are created by the authors, I will reference them as:
  > Shunxin Wang, Raymond Veldhuis, Christoph Brune, and Nicola Strisciuglio. *Synthetic datasets for studying frequency shortcuts in neural networks*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2023.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and citations, ensuring that each dataset is properly documented for future reference or analysis.
