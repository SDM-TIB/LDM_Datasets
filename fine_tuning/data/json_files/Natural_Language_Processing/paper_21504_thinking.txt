To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Text-to-Song: Towards Controllable Music Generation Incorporating Vocals and Accompaniment" by Zhiqing Hong et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that a Chinese song dataset was built to address data scarcity, which suggests that there is a specific dataset that I need to look for.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly section 5, where the authors discuss the datasets used for training and evaluation. In this section, they mention that they crawled five thousand Mandarin songs from a music website, which is a significant dataset for their research. They also reference several open-source Mandarin singing voice datasets.

I will compile the datasets mentioned in the paper:

1. **Crawled Mandarin Song Dataset**: This dataset consists of 5,000 Mandarin songs, covering around fifty singers, with a total of 180 hours of audio data. It includes lyrics and attribute tags (mood, instruments, style, etc.).

2. **Open-source Mandarin Singing Voice Datasets**: The paper lists several datasets used to alleviate data scarcity, including:
   - **Opencpop**: A singing dataset with text, duration, and MIDI annotations. Citation: Wang et al., 2022.
   - **M4Singer**: Another singing dataset with similar annotations. Citation: Zhang et al., 2022a.
   - **OpenSinger**: A singing dataset with text, duration, and MIDI annotations. Citation: Huang et al., 2021.
   - **PopCS**: A singing dataset with text and duration annotations. Citation: Liu et al., 2022.
   - **AISHELL-3**: A speech dataset with text and duration annotations. Citation: Shi et al., 2020.
   - **LP-MusicCaps-MSD**: A music dataset with text descriptions. Citation: Doh et al., 2023.

After identifying these datasets, I will ensure to retrieve the full citations for each dataset from the **References section** of the paper. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide a complete picture of the datasets used in the research.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation for each dataset. This will allow for a clear and organized presentation of the datasets utilized in the research.
