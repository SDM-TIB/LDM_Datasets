To extract datasets from the research paper titled "REDDIT: Regret Detection and Domain Identification from Text" by Fazlourrahman Balouchzahi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions a novel dataset of Reddit texts classified into three classes: Regret by Action, Regret by Inaction, and No Regret. This indicates that there is a specific dataset that I need to focus on.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets**. In this paper, the relevant section is **section 3 (Dataset Development)**. Here, the authors describe the dataset they created by scraping Reddit posts from three specific subreddits: "regret", "regretfulparents", and "confession". They provide details about the scraping process, the number of posts collected from each subreddit, and the filtering criteria applied to create the final dataset.

The dataset consists of:
1. **Regret Dataset**: This dataset includes posts from the three subreddits, with a total of 4,803 unlabeled posts after filtering. The authors also mention the annotation process and the classes into which the posts were categorized.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. Since the dataset is based on Reddit posts, I will cite the original source of the data collection method, which is the Pushshift API. However, the dataset itself does not have a formal citation like traditional datasets, so I will note that it is derived from Reddit posts.

The citation for the Pushshift API is:
> Pushshift API. Available at: https://github.com/pushshift/api

Additionally, I will note that the dataset is described in the paper itself, which can be cited as:
> Fazlourrahman Balouchzahi, Sabur Butt, Grigori Sidorov, and Alexander Gelbukh. "REDDIT: Regret Detection and Domain Identification from Text." arXiv preprint arXiv:XXXX.XXXX, 2023.

Now, I will compile the information about the dataset into a structured format, ensuring that I include the relevant citations and descriptions as required.
