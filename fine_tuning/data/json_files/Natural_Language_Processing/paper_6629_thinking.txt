To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Extremal GloVe: Theoretically Accurate Distributed Word Embedding by Tail Inference" by Hao Wang, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiment sections** to look for any references to datasets. The abstract does not explicitly mention any datasets, but it discusses the GloVe model and its applications, which may imply the use of datasets in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section. Here, the author discusses the significance of distributed word embeddings and mentions GloVe as a widely adopted model. However, there are no specific datasets mentioned in this section.

Moving on to the **related work** section, I will look for any references to datasets used in previous studies. The author cites several papers related to word embeddings but does not specify any datasets.

In the **experiment section**, the author mentions modifying the source code of the GloVe model and testing it using "the test data coming with the official GloVe GitHub repository." This indicates that the author used a specific dataset for their experiments, but the exact name of the dataset is not provided.

To ensure I have captured all relevant information, I will check the **references section** for any datasets that might have been used in the cited works. The references include foundational papers on Word2Vec and GloVe, but they do not provide specific datasets used in the experiments of this paper.

Since the paper does not explicitly name any datasets, I will summarize the findings as follows:

1. The paper discusses the GloVe model and its applications but does not provide specific datasets used for experiments.
2. The only mention of data is related to the "test data coming with the official GloVe GitHub repository," which implies the use of the GloVe dataset but does not provide a formal citation.

Given this analysis, I will document the findings, noting that while the paper discusses the GloVe model and its theoretical improvements, it does not provide specific datasets with full citations. Therefore, I will conclude that no datasets were explicitly extracted from this paper for formal citation.
