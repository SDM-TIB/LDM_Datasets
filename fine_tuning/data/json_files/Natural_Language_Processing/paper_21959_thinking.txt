To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Generative AI in Color-Changing Systems: Re-Programmable 3D Object Textures with Material and Design Constraints" by Yunyi Zhu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or implied. The abstract discusses generative AI tools and their applications, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors mention existing generative AI tools like Text2Mesh and Magic3D. However, they do not specify any datasets here either. I will continue to the **material constraints** and **data-encoded texture generation** sections to see if any datasets are referenced.

In the **material constraints section**, the authors discuss the properties of photochromic materials but do not mention any datasets. Moving on to the **data-encoded re-programmable texture generation section**, they describe challenges in generating data-encoded textures but again do not cite any datasets.

Finally, I will check the **references section** to see if any datasets are indirectly referenced through the works cited. The references include various papers related to generative AI and photochromic materials, but they do not explicitly mention datasets used in the current study.

After reviewing the entire paper, it appears that the authors do not provide specific datasets for their research. Instead, they discuss concepts and existing tools without referencing any particular dataset. Therefore, I will conclude that there are no datasets to extract from this paper.

Since no datasets were identified, I will not be able to provide full citations for datasets as there are none mentioned in the paper. This highlights the importance of thorough reading and understanding of the paper's content to accurately extract relevant information.
