To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Benchmarking Robustness of AI-Enabled Multi-sensor Fusion Systems: Challenges and Opportunities" by Xinyu Gao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's objectives and may mention specific datasets used for benchmarking.

Next, I will focus on the **background and benchmark construction sections**. In these sections, the authors discuss the datasets they utilized for their experiments. I will look for explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, descriptions, and any relevant details about their structure or purpose.

In the **benchmark construction section**, the authors specifically mention the **KITTI dataset** as a foundational dataset for their experiments. They describe it as a popular dataset for autonomous driving that includes data collected from various sensors, which is crucial for their multi-sensor fusion systems.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the KITTI dataset. The citation is as follows:
- **KITTI Dataset**: 
  > Andreas Geiger, Philip Lenz, and Raquel Urtasun. *Are we ready for autonomous driving? The KITTI vision benchmark suite*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 3354–3361, 2012.

Additionally, the authors mention that their corruption patterns can generalize to other datasets, such as **Waymo** and **NuScenes**. I will look for any specific references to these datasets in the paper and their citations.

For the **Waymo dataset**, the citation is:
- **Waymo Open Dataset**: 
  > Pei Sun, Henrik Kretzschmar, Xerxes Dotiwalla, Aurelien Chouard, Vijaysai Patnaik, Paul Tsui, James Guo, Yin Zhou, Yuning Chai, Benjamin Caine, et al. *Scalability in perception for autonomous driving: Waymo open dataset*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 2446–2454, 2020.

For the **NuScenes dataset**, the citation is:
- **NuScenes Dataset**: 
  > Holger Caesar, Varun Bankiti, Alex H Lang, Sourabh Vora, Venice Erin Liong, Qiang Xu, Anush Krishnan, Yu Pan, Giancarlo Baldan, and Oscar Beijbom. *NuScenes: A multimodal dataset for autonomous driving*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 11621–11631, 2020.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, which is essential for understanding the context and validity of the experiments conducted.
