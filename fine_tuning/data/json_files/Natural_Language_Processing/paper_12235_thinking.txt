To extract datasets from the research paper titled "High-Rate Phase Association with Travel Time Neural Fields" by Cheng Shi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses a new framework called Harpa for seismic phase association, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe their experimental setup. Here, they mention using a **synthetic wave speed dataset** generated from Gaussian random fields, which is crucial for understanding the performance of their method. They also refer to the **SEG/EAGE 3-D overthrust model** as a known wave speed model used in their experiments.

In **section 5 (Model and training details)**, the authors provide more details about the datasets. They describe the **Gaussian random field dataset** and the **Gaussian random perturbation dataset**. The Gaussian random field dataset consists of wave speeds generated by superimposing realizations of Gaussian random fields, while the Gaussian random perturbation dataset involves adding random Gaussian perturbations to a background wave speed.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the **References section** of the paper:

1. **Gaussian random field dataset**: The authors do not provide a specific citation for this dataset, as it appears to be generated for the purpose of their experiments. However, they mention that it is modeled by a 3D convolutional autoencoder, which is a common approach in machine learning.

2. **SEG/EAGE 3-D overthrust model**: The citation for this model is:
   > Fred Aminzadeh, P Weimer, and T Davis. *3-D Salt and Overthrust Seismic Models*. Studies in Geology, 42:247â€“256, 1996.

3. **Gaussian random perturbation dataset**: Similar to the Gaussian random field dataset, this dataset is also generated for the experiments, and no specific citation is provided.

After compiling this information, I will create structured entries for each dataset, ensuring that I include the relevant details and citations. This will allow for a comprehensive understanding of the datasets used in the research and their significance in the context of the study.
