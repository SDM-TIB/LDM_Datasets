To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MRN: Multiplexed Routing Network for Incremental Multilingual Text Recognition" by Tianlun Zheng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method on the **MLT17** and **MLT19** datasets, which is a strong indication that these datasets will be discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any relevant sections that discuss the datasets used in the experiments. In this case, the **experiments section** (specifically section 4.1) provides detailed statistics about the datasets, confirming the use of **MLT17** and **MLT19**.

In section 4.1, the authors provide the following details:

1. **MLT17 Dataset**: This dataset contains 68,613 training instances and 16,255 validation instances from 6 scripts and 9 languages, including Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Bangla, Arabic, Italian, English, French, and German. The dataset is used for multilingual scene text recognition tasks.

2. **MLT19 Dataset**: This dataset has 89,177 text instances from 7 scripts. The authors mention that they randomly split the training instances for model training and testing due to the unavailability of a test set.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **MLT17**, the citation is:
  > Nibal Nayef, Fei Yin, Imen Bizid, Hyunsoo Choi, Yuan Feng, Dimosthenis Karatzas, Zhenbo Luo, Umapada Pal, Christophe Rigaud, Joseph Chazalon, et al. *ICDAR 2017 Robust Reading Challenge on Multi-lingual Scene Text Detection and Script Identification - RRC-MLT*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition (ICDAR), volume 1, pages 1454–1459, 2017.

- For **MLT19**, the citation is:
  > Nibal Nayef, Yash Patel, Michal Busta, Pinaki Nath Chowdhury, Dimosthenis Karatzas, Wafa Khlif, Jiri Matas, Umapada Pal, Jean-Christophe Burie, Cheng-lin Liu, et al. *ICDAR 2019 Robust Reading Challenge on Multi-lingual Scene Text Detection and Recognition—RRC-MLT-2019*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition (ICDAR), pages 1582–1587, 2019.

With this information, I can now summarize the datasets extracted from the paper, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This structured approach allows for a comprehensive extraction of dataset information from the research paper.
