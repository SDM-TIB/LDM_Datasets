To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Panoptic Perception: A Novel Task and Fine-grained Dataset for Universal Remote Sensing Image Interpretation" by Danpei Zhao et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and dataset construction sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract introduces a new dataset called **FineGrip**, which is a key focus of the paper. This indicates that I should look for detailed descriptions of this dataset in the subsequent sections.

Next, I will examine **section IV (Dataset Construction)**, where the authors provide a comprehensive description of the **FineGrip dataset**. They mention that it includes:

- **2,649 remote sensing images**
- **12,054 fine-grained instance segmentation masks** belonging to **20 foreground categories**
- **7,599 background semantic masks** for **5 stuff classes**
- **13,245 captioning sentences**

The authors also detail the categories included in the dataset, which consist of various aircraft models and background categories related to airport scenes.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The authors mention that the images in the FineGrip dataset are derived from the **MAR20 dataset**. Therefore, I need to find the citation for both the FineGrip dataset and the MAR20 dataset.

The citation for the **MAR20 dataset** is:
> Wenqi, Y., Gong, C., Meijun, W., Yanqing, Y., Xingxing, X., Xiwen, Y., & Junwei, H. (2023). *MAR20: A benchmark for military aircraft recognition in remote sensing images*. National Remote Sensing Bulletin, 27(12), 2688–2696.

Since the FineGrip dataset is a novel dataset introduced in this paper, I will cite it as follows:
> Zhao, D., Yuan, B., Chen, Z., Li, T., Liu, Z., Li, W., & Gao, Y. (2023). *Panoptic Perception: A Novel Task and Fine-grained Dataset for Universal Remote Sensing Image Interpretation*. Journal of LaTeX Class Files, vol. X, no. X, pp. X–X.

Now, I will compile the dataset information, ensuring to include the full citations for both datasets in the final output. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets mentioned in the paper.
