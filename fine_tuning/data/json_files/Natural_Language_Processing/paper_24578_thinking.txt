To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Revisiting Backdoor Attacks against Large Vision-Language Models" by Siyuan Liang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of backdoor attacks on image caption benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved, but I need to find specific names.

Next, I will look into the **methodology** and **experiments** sections, particularly focusing on any sections that explicitly mention datasets used for evaluation. In the paper, the authors mention using the **MIMIC-IT dataset** for instruction tuning and the **COCO** and **Flickr30K** datasets for evaluation of the backdoor attacks.

I will also check the **results** section to confirm the datasets used in the experiments and to gather any additional details about them. The authors provide performance metrics for the attacks on these datasets, which further validates their use.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to retrieve full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

1. For the **MIMIC-IT dataset**, the citation is:
   > Lei Li, Yuwei Yin, Shicheng Li, Liang Chen, Peiyi Wang, Shuhuai Ren, Mukai Li, Yazheng Yang, Jingjing Xu, Xu Sun, et al. *M3IT: A Large-Scale Dataset Towards Multi-Modal Multilingual Instruction Tuning*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2306.04387, 2023.

2. For the **COCO dataset**, the citation is:
   > Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, Serge Belongie, James Hays, Pietro Perona, Deva Ramanan, Piotr Dollár, and C Lawrence Zitnick. *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. In Computer Vision–ECCV 2014: 13th European Conference, Zurich, Switzerland, September 6-12, 2014, Proceedings, Part V 13, pages 740–755. Springer, 2014.

3. For the **Flickr30K dataset**, the citation is:
   > Bryan A Plummer, Liwei Wang, Chris M Cervantes, Juan C Caicedo, Julia Hockenmaier, and Svetlana Lazebnik. *Flickr30k Entities: Collecting Region-to-Phrase Correspondences for Richer Image-to-Sentence Models*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision, pages 2641–2649, 2015.

After gathering the dataset names and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly presents each dataset along with its citation. This will ensure that the datasets are properly documented and can be referenced by others in future research.
