To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Counterfactual Co-occurring Learning for Bias Mitigation in Weakly-supervised Object Localization" by Feifei Shao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that extensive experiments were conducted across multiple benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved. I will look for specific names of datasets in these sections.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section IV), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, the authors explicitly mention three datasets:

1. **CUB-200-2011**: This dataset is noted for focusing on subordinate categorization and contains 5,994 images with image-level labels in the training set and 5,794 images with instance-level labels in the test set.

2. **ILSVRC 2016**: This dataset includes over 1.2 million images across 1,000 categories, with image-level labels in the training set and 50,000 images with instance-level labels in the validation set.

3. **OpenImages30k**: This dataset consists of 100 classes and is divided into three disjoint sub-datasets: train-weaksup, train-fullsup, and test, with specific numbers of images in each subset.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and will be formatted as follows:

- For **CUB-200-2011**, the citation is:
  > Wah, C., Branson, S., Welinder, P., Perona, P., & Belongie, S. (2011). *The Caltech-UCSD Birds-200-2011 Dataset*. 

- For **ILSVRC 2016**, the citation is:
  > Russakovsky, O., Deng, J., Su, H., Krause, J., Satheesh, S., Ma, S., Huang, Z., Karpathy, A., Khosla, A., Bernstein, M., et al. (2015). *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. 

- For **OpenImages30k**, the citation is:
  > Choe, J., Oh, S. J., Lee, S., Chun, S., Akata, Z., & Shim, H. (2020). *Evaluating Weakly Supervised Object Localization Methods Right*. 

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this into a structured format for further processing or review.
