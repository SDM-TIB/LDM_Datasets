To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Prefixing a Length for Faster Word Vector Serialization" by Brian Lester, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses various word vector formats but does not specify any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine **section 4 (Benchmarks)**, where the author discusses the pre-trained word embeddings used for evaluation. This section includes a table (Table 1) that lists several pre-trained word embeddings, which are likely the datasets of interest. The embeddings mentioned are:

1. **GloVe 6B**
2. **GloVe 27B**
3. **GloVe 42B**
4. **GloVe 840B**
5. **FastText Wiki**
6. **FastText Crawl**
7. **Google News**

In this section, the author provides statistics about these embeddings, indicating that they are used for benchmarking the proposed Leader format.

Now, I will look for the **full citations** for these datasets in the **References section** of the paper. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **GloVe 6B, GloVe 27B, GloVe 42B, and GloVe 840B**, the citation is:
  > Jeffrey Pennington, Richard Socher, and Christopher Manning. *GloVe: Global Vectors for Word Representation*. In Proceedings of the 2014 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), pages 1532–1543, Doha, Qatar. Association for Computational Linguistics, 2014.

- For **FastText Wiki** and **FastText Crawl**, the citation is:
  > Piotr Bojanowski, Edouard Grave, Armand Joulin, and Tomas Mikolov. *Enriching Word Vectors with Subword Information*. Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics, 5:135–146, 2017.

- For **Google News**, the citation is:
  > Tomas Mikolov, Ilya Sutskever, Kai Chen, Greg S. Corrado, and Jeff Dean. *Distributed Representations of Words and Phrases and their Compositionality*. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 26, pages 3111–3119. Curran Associates, Inc., 2013.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their corresponding citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. Each dataset will be documented with its name and full citation to ensure proper attribution.
