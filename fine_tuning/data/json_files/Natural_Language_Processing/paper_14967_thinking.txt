To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Improving Large Language Model Fine-Tuning for Solving Math Problems" by Yixin Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the use of the **MATH dataset**, which is a strong indication that this dataset is central to the research.

Next, I will look for specific sections that discuss datasets in detail. In this case, the **Methods** section (specifically section 4) provides a clear overview of the datasets used in the experiments. Here, the authors explicitly mention:

1. **MATH Dataset**: This dataset is described as consisting of problems collected from high school math competitions, along with human-written solutions. The authors reference the original paper that introduced this dataset, which is crucial for citation purposes.

2. **PRM800K Dataset**: This dataset is mentioned as a source of correct step-by-step solutions for training, specifically generated by GPT-4. The authors also provide a reference to the paper that discusses this dataset.

In the **Experiments** section, the authors confirm that they conducted their experiments using the **MATH dataset** and the **PRM800K dataset**, reinforcing their importance in the study.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset from the **References section**:

- For the **MATH dataset**, the citation is:
  > Dan Hendrycks, Collin Burns, Saurav Kadavath, Akul Arora, Steven Basart, Eric Tang, Dawn Song, and Jacob Steinhardt. *Measuring Mathematical Problem Solving with the MATH Dataset*. NeurIPS, 2021.

- For the **PRM800K dataset**, the citation is:
  > Hunter Lightman, Vineet Kosaraju, Yura Burda, Harrison Edwards, Bowen Baker, Teddy Lee, Jan Leike, John Schulman, Ilya Sutskever, and Karl Cobbe. *Letâ€™s Verify Step by Step*. ArXiv, abs/2305.20050, 2023.

After collecting this information, I will summarize the datasets and their citations clearly, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its corresponding citation for future reference or use in downstream tasks.
