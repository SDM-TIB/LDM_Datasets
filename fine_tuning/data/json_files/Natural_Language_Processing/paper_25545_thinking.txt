To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multimodal Misinformation Detection using Large Vision-Language Models" by Sahar Tahmasebi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on two datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any relevant subsections within the **experiments** section. In this paper, the authors mention two datasets in **section 4.1 (Experimental Setup)**:

1. **MOCHEG Dataset**: This dataset is described as a multimodal fact-checking benchmark originally based on textual claims from Snopes and PolitiFact, with associated text and image evidences. The dataset is divided into train, validation, and test sets.

2. **Factify Dataset**: This dataset features news from India and the United States, with both claims and evidence being multimodal. The data is originally labeled in five categories, which the authors convert into three broader categories for their experiments.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. Here are the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **MOCHEG Dataset**, the citation is:

In Proceedings of the International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval (SIGIR 2023), pages 2733â€“2743. https://doi.org/10.1145/3539618.3591879

- For the **Factify Dataset**, the citation is:

CEUR-WS.org. https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-3199/paper18.pdf

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their respective references.
