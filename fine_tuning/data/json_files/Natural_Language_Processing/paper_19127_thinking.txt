To extract datasets from the research paper titled "PointMamba: A Simple State Space Model for Point Cloud Analysis" by Dingkang Liang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the proposed method, PointMamba, is evaluated on various point cloud analysis tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4) to identify specific datasets used for evaluation. In **subsection 4.2**, the authors mention three datasets for their experiments:

1. **ModelNet40**: This dataset is described as a pristine 3D CAD dataset comprising 40 categories. It is used for synthetic object classification.

2. **ScanObjectNN**: This dataset consists of about 15,000 objects across 15 categories, scanned from real-world indoor scenes. It is used for real-world object classification.

3. **ShapeNetPart**: This dataset is used for part segmentation tasks, aiming to predict detailed labels for each point within a sample.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **ModelNet40**, the citation is:
  > Zhirong Wu, Shuran Song, Aditya Khosla, Fisher Yu, Linguang Zhang, Xiaoou Tang, and Jianxiong Xiao. *3D ShapeNets: A Deep Representation for Volumetric Shapes*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 1–8, 2015.

- For **ScanObjectNN**, the citation is:
  > Mikaela Angelina Uy, Quang-Hieu Pham, Binh-Son Hua, Thanh Nguyen, and Sai-Kit Yeung. *Revisiting Point Cloud Classification: A New Benchmark Dataset and Classification Model on Real-World Data*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 1–8, 2019.

- For **ShapeNetPart**, the citation is:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes the full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
