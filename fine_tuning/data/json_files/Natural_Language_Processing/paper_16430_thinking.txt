To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Optimisation-Based Multi-Modal Semantic Image Editing" by Bowen Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract discusses the evaluation of the proposed method using various editing conditions, which may imply the use of specific datasets. The introduction may provide further context or mention specific datasets used for experiments.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. This is typically where authors describe the datasets they used for their evaluations. I will pay close attention to any specific names or descriptions of datasets, including their characteristics and the context in which they were used.

In this paper, I will specifically look for mentions of datasets related to image editing tasks, such as those used for training or evaluating the proposed methods. I will also check the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access the datasets.

If the paper mentions datasets like "ImageNet" or any other specific datasets, I will ensure to extract their full citations from the references. For example, if "ImageNet" is mentioned, I will note its citation as follows:

- For **ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, and Li Fei-Fei. *Imagenet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In 2009 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 248â€“255. IEEE, 2009.

After gathering all relevant information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, facilitating further exploration and validation of the findings presented in the paper.
