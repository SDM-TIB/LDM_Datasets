To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An Example of Evolutionary Computation + Large Language Model Beating Human: Design of Efficient Guided Local Search" by Fei Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention any datasets used for evaluation. In this case, the authors discuss experimental results on **1,000 TSP20-TSP100 instances and TSPLib instances**, indicating that these are datasets relevant to their experiments.

Next, I will look for specific sections that detail the datasets, such as **section 4 (Experiments)** and **section 4.3 (Evaluation of Evolved Algorithm)**. Here, the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments:

1. **TSP20, TSP50, and TSP100 instances**: These datasets consist of instances of the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) with varying numbers of nodes (20, 50, and 100). The authors state that the coordinates of the nodes in each instance are randomly sampled from the range [0, 1].

2. **TSPLib instances**: This dataset includes 29 instances derived from real-world problems, showcasing diverse geometric distributions. The authors compare their algorithm against various other algorithms on these instances.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. However, since TSP instances and TSPLib are well-known datasets, they may not have specific citations in the references. Instead, I can provide general information about them:

- **TSP Instances**: The TSP instances are commonly used benchmarks in optimization research, and while they may not have a specific citation, they are widely recognized in the literature.

- **TSPLib**: The TSPLib is a well-known library of TSP instances, and the citation for it is:
  > Applegate, D., Bixby, R., Chvatal, V., and Cook, W. Concorde TSP Solver. 2006.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **TSP20, TSP50, TSP100 Instances**: Randomly generated instances of the Traveling Salesman Problem with 20, 50, and 100 nodes, respectively.

2. **TSPLib Instances**: A collection of 29 real-world TSP instances with diverse geometric distributions.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for clarity and future reference.
