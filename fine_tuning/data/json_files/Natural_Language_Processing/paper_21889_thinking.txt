To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Retrieval and Distill: A Temporal Data Shift-Free Paradigm for Online Recommendation System" by Lei Zheng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that extensive experiments were conducted on multiple real datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they state that they conducted experiments on three real-world large-scale recommendation datasets from Alibaba and Ant Group: **Taobao, Tmall, and Alipay**. This is a clear indication that these datasets are crucial for the research.

I will then look for a **table or detailed description** of these datasets within the experiments section. The paper includes **Table 1**, which provides detailed information about each dataset, including the number of instances, the split of data into training, testing, and shifting datasets, as well as the timeframes for each dataset.

The datasets are described as follows:

1. **Taobao Dataset**: 
   - Instances: 145,416,702 (Dshifting), 2,754,415 (Dtrain), 2,734,177 (Dtest)
   - Start time: 2017-11-25
   - End time: 2017-12-01

2. **Tmall Dataset**: 
   - Instances: 68,646,472 (Dshifting), 6,679,610 (Dtrain), 7,055,119 (Dtest)
   - Start time: 2015-05-11
   - End time: 2015-10-31

3. **Alipay Dataset**: 
   - Instances: 82,090,360 (Dshifting), 264,843 (Dtrain), 431,646 (Dtest)
   - Start time: 2015-07-01
   - End time: 2015-10-31

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The paper mentions that these datasets are sourced from Alibaba and Ant Group, and they provide a link to the datasets on Tianchi, which is a platform for machine learning competitions and datasets.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

- **Taobao Dataset**: 
  > Alibaba Group. *Taobao Dataset*. Available at: https://tianchi.aliyun.com/dataset/649

- **Tmall Dataset**: 
  > Alibaba Group. *Tmall Dataset*. Available at: https://tianchi.aliyun.com/dataset/42

- **Alipay Dataset**: 
  > Alibaba Group. *Alipay Dataset*. Available at: https://tianchi.aliyun.com/dataset/53

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
