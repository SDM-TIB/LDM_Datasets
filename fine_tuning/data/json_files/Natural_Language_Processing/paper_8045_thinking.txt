To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Follow-up Attention: An Empirical Study of Developer and Neural Model Code Exploration" by Matteo Paltenghi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors contributed an **open-source eye-tracking dataset** comprising 92 manually-labeled sessions from 25 developers. This suggests that there is a dataset that I need to document.

Next, I will look closely at the **methodology section**, particularly where the authors describe their eye-tracking study. Here, they mention that the dataset consists of **92 valid sessions** with developers engaged in sensemaking tasks while using a common code editor. This section provides details about the dataset's structure and the context in which it was collected.

In the **results section**, the authors discuss the dataset's characteristics, including the programming languages involved (Python, C++, and C#) and the average time spent by participants. This information is crucial for understanding the dataset's scope and application.

I will also check the **data availability section** to find any links or references to where the dataset can be accessed. The authors mention that the dataset is available at specific DOI links, which I will need to include in the citation.

Now, I will compile the information I have gathered about the dataset:

1. **Eye-Tracking Dataset**: This dataset includes 92 sessions of eye-tracking data from 25 developers, focusing on sensemaking tasks in three programming languages (Python, C++, and C#). The dataset captures eye fixation events and is designed to study how developers explore code.

Next, I will retrieve the full citation for this dataset from the references section. The authors provide the following citation for the dataset:

> Paltenghi, M., Pandita, R., Henley, A. Z., & Ziegler, A. (2023). *Follow-up Attention: An Empirical Study of Developer and Neural Model Code Exploration*. Available at: https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.23599251 (raw eye tracking sessions) and https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.23599233 (clean version).

Finally, I will ensure that I have all the necessary details to create a structured entry for the dataset, including its name, description, and citation. This will allow me to present the dataset information clearly and accurately.
