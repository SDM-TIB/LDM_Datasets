To extract datasets from the research paper titled "LLMs Plagiarize: Ensuring Responsible Sourcing of Large Language Model Training Data Through Knowledge Graph Comparison" by Devam Mondal and Carlo Lipizzi, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract does not explicitly mention any datasets, so I will move on to the introduction.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the legal implications of using copyrighted materials for training large language models but do not specify any datasets. I will continue to the **literature review** and **approach sections** to see if any datasets are referenced.

In the **literature review**, the authors cite various studies and methods related to identifying training data for LLMs, but again, no specific datasets are mentioned. I will check the **approach section** for any references to datasets used in their proposed method.

In the **approach section**, the authors describe their method for assessing whether a source document has been used in training an LLM, but they do not mention any specific datasets. I will also review the **experiments section** to see if any datasets are utilized in their testing or validation processes.

After thoroughly reviewing the paper, it appears that the authors do not explicitly mention any datasets used for their research. Instead, they focus on a novel methodology for assessing the training data of LLMs without providing specific datasets.

Since no datasets are identified in the paper, I will not be able to provide full citations for any datasets. However, I will summarize the findings regarding the absence of datasets and note that the authors primarily focus on a conceptual framework rather than empirical datasets.

In conclusion, I will document that the paper does not provide specific datasets, and therefore, there are no citations to extract. This highlights the need for further research that includes empirical data to validate the proposed methods.
