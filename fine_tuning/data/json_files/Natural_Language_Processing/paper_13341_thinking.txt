To extract datasets from the research paper titled "TFDNet: Time-Frequency Enhanced Decomposed Network for Long-term Time Series Forecasting" by Yuxiao Luo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract states that the authors conducted experimental evaluations on **eight datasets from five benchmark domains**, which indicates that multiple datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors typically provide detailed information about the datasets used. In this section, they mention the datasets explicitly:

1. **Traffic Dataset**: Contains freeway occupation rates from 862 sensors in California, USA.
2. **Electricity Dataset**: Contains hourly electricity consumption data for 321 customers.
3. **ILI Dataset**: Contains weekly counts of influenza-like illness patients in the United States.
4. **ETT Datasets**: Includes four datasets (ETTm1, ETTm2, ETTh1, ETTh2) derived from electricity transformer temperature data, with different sampling resolutions.

The authors also provide a summary table (Table 5) that outlines the features of these datasets, including their lengths, number of features, and frequencies.

Now, I will check the **References section** to gather full citations for each dataset mentioned. The citations may not always be directly provided for datasets, but I can infer them from the context or look for the original sources if they are referenced.

For the datasets mentioned, I will compile the following citations based on the information provided in the paper:

- **Traffic Dataset**: 
  > California Department of Transportation. *PeMS Traffic Data*. Available at: http://pems.dot.ca.gov

- **Electricity Dataset**: 
  > Electricity Load Diagrams 2011-2014. *UCI Machine Learning Repository*. Available at: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/ElectricityLoadDiagrams20112014

- **ILI Dataset**: 
  > Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. *FluView: Influenza Surveillance*. Available at: https://gis.cdc.gov/grasp/fluview/fluportaldashboard.html

- **ETT Datasets**: 
  > Zhou, H., Zhang, S., Peng, J., Zhang, S., Li, J., Xiong, H., and Zhang, W. *Informer: Beyond Efficient Transformer for Long Sequence Time-Series Forecasting*. In Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, 2021.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets and their citations in a structured format for clarity and future reference. This ensures that I have accurately captured all relevant datasets and their sources from the paper.
