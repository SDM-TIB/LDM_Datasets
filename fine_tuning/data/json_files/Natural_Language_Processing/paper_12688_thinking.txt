To extract datasets from the research paper titled "HANDAL: A Dataset of Real-World Manipulable Object Categories with Pose Annotations, Affordances, and Reconstructions" by Andrew Guo et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and dataset overview sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a concise summary of the HANDAL dataset, indicating that it consists of 308k annotated image frames from 2.2k videos of 212 real-world objects in 17 categories. This suggests that the HANDAL dataset is the primary focus.

Next, I will look for specific details about the dataset in the **dataset overview section**. Here, the authors describe the dataset's characteristics, including the number of object categories, the types of annotations provided (such as 6-DoF pose and affordance annotations), and the methodology used for data collection. They emphasize that the dataset is designed for robotic manipulation and functional grasping, which is crucial for understanding its application.

In the **comparison with other datasets section**, the authors mention several related datasets, but they focus on how HANDAL differs from them. This section does not introduce new datasets but reinforces the uniqueness of HANDAL.

I will also check the **results and discussion sections** for any additional datasets or comparisons that might provide context or validation for HANDAL. However, it appears that HANDAL is the main dataset discussed throughout the paper.

Finally, I will consult the **references section** to find the full citation for the HANDAL dataset. The authors do not provide a separate citation for HANDAL, as it is their own dataset. However, they reference other datasets that may be relevant for comparison.

The full citation for the HANDAL dataset is:
> Andrew Guo, Bowen Wen, Jianhe Yuan, Jonathan Tremblay, Stephen Tyree, Jeffrey Smith, Stan Birchfield. *HANDAL: A Dataset of Real-World Manipulable Object Categories with Pose Annotations, Affordances, and Reconstructions*. NVIDIA.

Now, I will compile the information about the HANDAL dataset, ensuring to include the full citation as required. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the dataset extracted from the paper.
