To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Implementation of Hyperspectral Inversion Algorithms on FPGA: Hardware Comparison using High Level Synthesis" by El Mehdi Abdali et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses hyperspectral imaging and the need for efficient processing algorithms, but it does not specify any datasets directly.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4) to see if the authors mention any specific datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, they describe their experimental setup and the hardware used, but they do not explicitly mention any datasets.

I will also check the **references section** to see if any datasets are cited in the context of previous works or methodologies. The references include various papers related to hyperspectral imaging and algorithms, but I need to determine if any of these references correspond to datasets.

After reviewing the references, I find that the paper cites several works that may involve datasets, but none are explicitly named as datasets used in this study. The authors focus on algorithmic comparisons rather than specific datasets.

Since no specific datasets are mentioned in the paper, I will conclude that there are no datasets to extract for this particular research paper. However, I will note the importance of checking the references for potential datasets used in related works.

In summary, I will document my findings as follows:

1. **No specific datasets were identified in the paper.**
2. **The references may contain citations to datasets used in related research, but none were explicitly mentioned in the context of this study.**

This approach ensures that I have thoroughly examined the paper for any datasets while also recognizing the importance of the references for future research.
