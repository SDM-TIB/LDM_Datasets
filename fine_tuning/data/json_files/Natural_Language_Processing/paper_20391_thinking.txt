To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Few-Shot VQA with Frozen LLMs: A Tale of Two Approaches" by Igor Sterner et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses comparing two approaches to visual question answering (VQA) but does not specify datasets. The introduction provides context about VQA but does not mention specific datasets either.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used. Here, they state that they use the **Conceptual Captions dataset** as training data. This is a clear indication that a dataset is being utilized.

I will then look for the details about the dataset, including its size and purpose. The authors mention that from the 3M+ image URLs provided in the Conceptual Captions dataset, they found 2.7M to be active. This gives me a good understanding of the dataset's scale and relevance.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Conceptual Captions dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:

- For **Conceptual Captions dataset**:
  > Piyush Sharma, Nan Ding, Sebastian Goodman, and Radu Soricut. *Conceptual Captions: A Cleaned, Hypernymed, Image Alt-text Dataset For Automatic Image Captioning*. In Proceedings of the 56th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers), pages 2556â€“2565, Melbourne, Australia, 2018. Association for Computational Linguistics.

Since this is the only dataset mentioned in the paper, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity.

After gathering all the necessary details, I will ensure that the dataset entry is complete and ready for any further processing or review.
