To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SymTax: Symbiotic Relationship and Taxonomy Fusion for Effective Citation Recommendation" by Karan Goyal et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract states that the authors built a novel and large dataset called **ArSyTa**, which contains 8.27 million citation contexts. This indicates that there is at least one dataset to document.

Next, I will examine **section 3 (Proposed Dataset)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the datasets used in their research. Here, they mention several datasets, including:

1. **ArSyTa**: This is the primary dataset introduced in the paper, comprising 8.27 million citation contexts. The authors describe its creation process and highlight its size and features compared to existing datasets.

2. **ACL-200**: This dataset contains papers published at ACL venues and is a processed version of the ACL-ARC dataset.

3. **RefSeer**: This dataset is curated from scientific articles in various engineering domains, containing 3.7 million citation contexts.

4. **arXiv (HAtten)**: This dataset is created using arXiv papers from a large corpus of scientific articles and follows a similar extraction method as ACL-200 and RefSeer.

In the **experiments section**, the authors confirm that they used **ArSyTa**, **ACL-200**, **RefSeer**, and **arXiv (HAtten)** for their evaluations. This reinforces the datasets identified in section 3.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to gather full citations for each dataset:

- For **ArSyTa**, since it is a novel dataset introduced by the authors, I will cite it as follows:
  > Karan Goyal, Mayank Goel, Vikram Goyal, and Mukesh Mohania. *SymTax: Symbiotic Relationship and Taxonomy Fusion for Effective Citation Recommendation*. In Proceedings of the ACL 2024.

- For **ACL-200**, the citation is:
  > Zafar Ali, Guilin Qi, Khan Muhammad, Pavlos Kefalas, and Shah Khusro. 2021. Global citation recommendation employing generative adversarial network. Expert Syst. Appl., 180(C).

- For **RefSeer**, the citation is:
  > Zoran Medi´c and Jan Šnajder. 2020. Improved local citation recommendation based on context enhanced with global information. In Proceedings of the first workshop on scholarly document processing, pages 97–103.

- For **arXiv (HAtten)**, the citation is:
  > Nianlong Gu, Yingqiang Gao, and Richard HR Hahnloser. 2022. Local citation recommendation with hierarchical-attention text encoder and scibert-based reranking. In European Conference on Information Retrieval, pages 274–288. Springer.

With these citations in hand, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
