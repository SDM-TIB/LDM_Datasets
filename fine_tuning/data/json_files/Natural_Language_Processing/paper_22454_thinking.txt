To extract datasets from the research paper titled "OverlapMamba: Novel Shift State Space Model for LiDAR-based Place Recognition" by Qiuchi Xiang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the method is evaluated on **three different public datasets**, which indicates that I should look for specific names in the subsequent sections.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section. Here, the authors discuss the importance of place recognition and mention that their method is evaluated on three datasets. However, they do not specify the names yet, so I will need to look further into the paper.

I will then focus on the **experiments section** (Section IV), where the authors typically provide details about the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they explicitly mention the three datasets:

1. **KITTI Dataset**: This dataset contains real image data collected in urban, rural, and highway scenes, with various degrees of occlusion and truncation.

2. **Ford Campus Dataset**: This dataset is collected from an autonomous ground vehicle testing platform, featuring vehicle trajectory paths that contain several loops.

3. **NCLT Dataset**: Collected at the University of Michigan, this dataset includes data collected repeatedly across different times of the day and seasons.

Next, I will verify the details of these datasets in the **References section** to ensure I can provide accurate citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **KITTI Dataset**, the citation is:
  > A. Geiger, P. Lenz, and R. Urtasun. *Are we ready for autonomous driving? The KITTI vision benchmark suite*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 3354–3361, 2012.

- For the **Ford Campus Dataset**, the citation is:
  > G. Pandey, J. R. McBride, and R. M. Eustice. *Ford campus vision and lidar data set*. The International Journal of Robotics Research, vol. 30, no. 13, pp. 1543–1552, 2011.

- For the **NCLT Dataset**, the citation is:
  > N. Carlevaris-Bianco, A. K. Ushani, and R. M. Eustice. *University of Michigan North Campus long-term vision and lidar dataset*. The International Journal of Robotics Research, vol. 35, no. 9, pp. 1023–1035, 2016.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations.
