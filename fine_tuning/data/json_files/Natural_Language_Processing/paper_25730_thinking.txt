To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Boosting Large Language Models with Socratic Method for Conversational Mathematics Teaching" by Yuyang Ding et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors collected and released a dataset named **SocraticMATH**, which is a strong lead for my extraction process.

Next, I will delve into **section 3 (Dataset)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset construction and characteristics. Here, they describe the **SocraticMATH dataset**, which contains Socratic-style conversations related to mathematical problems. The dataset is constructed through data collection, pre-annotation, and human annotation phases, and it covers 513 knowledge points of primary school math.

In **section 3.2 (Dataset Analysis)**, the authors present statistical information about the SocraticMATH dataset, confirming its size and the nature of the conversations. This section provides valuable insights into the dataset's structure and purpose.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the SocraticMATH dataset. However, since this dataset is newly introduced in this paper, it may not have a separate citation in the references. Instead, I will cite the paper itself as the source of the dataset.

The full citation for the dataset is:
> Yuyang Ding, Hanglei Hu, Jie Zhou, Qin Chen, Bo Jiang, and Liang He. 2024. Boosting Large Language Models with Socratic Method for Conversational Mathematics Teaching. In Proceedings of the 33rd ACM International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management (CIKM ’24), October 21–25, 2024, Boise, ID, USA. ACM, New York, NY, USA, 6 pages. https://doi.org/10.1145/3627673.3679881

Having gathered all necessary information, I will summarize the dataset details and prepare to compile them into a structured format for further processing. The key dataset extracted is **SocraticMATH**, and I will ensure to include its citation in any output I generate.
