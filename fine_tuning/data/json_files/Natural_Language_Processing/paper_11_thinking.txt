To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Closed Form Word Embedding Alignment" by Sunipa Dev et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the techniques used, but I will need to look for specific datasets in the introduction and methods sections.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss various word embedding techniques and their applications, but they do not mention specific datasets yet. I will continue to the **datasets section** to find detailed information.

In **section 3 (Word Embedding Techniques and Data Sets)**, the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. They mention the following datasets:

1. **Latest Wikipedia Dump**: This dataset consists of approximately 4.57 billion tokens and has a vocabulary of 243,000 tokens. It is sourced from the Wikipedia dump available at dumps.wikimedia.org/enwiki/latest/enwiki-latest-pages-articles.xml.bz2.

2. **French Wikipedia Dump**: The authors also utilize the French Wikipedia dump for extracting word embeddings, which can be found at https://dumps.wikimedia.org/frwiki/.

3. **Spanish Wikipedia Dump**: Similarly, the Spanish Wikipedia dump is used, available at https://dumps.wikimedia.org/eswiki/.

4. **GloVe Embedding for Wikipedia + Gigaword**: This dataset contains 6 billion tokens and has a vocabulary of 400,000 tokens. It can be accessed from GloVe’s homepage at https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/.

5. **GloVe Embedding of Common Crawl**: This dataset has 42 billion tokens and a vocabulary of 1.9 million tokens, also available on GloVe’s homepage.

6. **GloVe Embedding of Common Crawl (840B tokens)**: This dataset contains 840 billion tokens and has a vocabulary of 2.2 million tokens, found on GloVe’s homepage.

7. **word2vec Embedding of Google News**: This dataset consists of 100 billion tokens and has a vocabulary of 3 million tokens, available at https://code.google.com/archive/p/word2vec/.

Next, I will check the **References section** to ensure I have the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
