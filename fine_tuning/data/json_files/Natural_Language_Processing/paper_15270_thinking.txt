To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On existence, uniqueness and scalability of adversarial robustness and control measures for AI classifiers" by Illia Horenko, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the paper discusses computations on "common synthetic benchmarks" and "two biomedical data problems," which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments and results sections** to find specific mentions of datasets. In the paper, the author refers to two biomedical applications: one for health insurance claim predictions and another for heart attack lethality classification. I will look for the exact names of the datasets used for these applications.

In the **availability of data, code, and material section**, the author provides links to the datasets used in the biomedical examples:

1. **Insurance Claim Dataset**: The dataset is available at the link provided in the paper: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/easonlai/sample-insurance-claim-prediction-dataset. This dataset is used for the health insurance claim predictions.

2. **Heart Failure Clinical Data**: The dataset is available at the link provided in the paper: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/heart-failure-clinical-data. This dataset is used for the heart attack lethality classification.

Now, I will retrieve the full citations for these datasets. Since the datasets are hosted on Kaggle, I will cite them as follows:

- For the **Insurance Claim Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Eason Lai. *Sample Insurance Claim Prediction Dataset*. Kaggle. Available at: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/easonlai/sample-insurance-claim-prediction-dataset.

- For the **Heart Failure Clinical Data**, the citation is:
  > Andrew MVD. *Heart Failure Clinical Data*. Kaggle. Available at: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/heart-failure-clinical-data.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all necessary details are captured for future reference or processing.
