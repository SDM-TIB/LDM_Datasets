To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Prompting for Numerical Sequences: A Case Study on Market Comment Generation" by Masayuki Kawarada et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study involves generating market comments from numerical sequences, which suggests that there may be a dataset related to stock prices and market comments.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors reference previous works, specifically mentioning datasets used for generating market comments. They cite studies by Murakami et al. (2017), Aoki et al. (2018), and Hamazono et al. (2021), which implies that these works may contain datasets relevant to this study.

In the **methods section**, particularly in **section 5.1 (Dataset)**, the authors provide a detailed description of the dataset they used. They mention that the dataset contains 18,489 pairs of time-series numerical sequences and market comments, derived from IBISquare, covering stock price data from December 2010 to September 2016. This section confirms the existence of a specific dataset used in their experiments.

Now, I will gather the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. **Dataset from Murakami et al. (2017)**:
   > Soichiro Murakami, Akihiko Watanabe, Akira Miyazawa, Keiichi Goshima, Toshihiko Yanase, Hiroya Takamura, and Yusuke Miyao. *Learning to generate market comments from stock prices*. In Proceedings of the 55th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers), pages 1374–1384, Vancouver, Canada, 2017.

2. **Dataset from Aoki et al. (2018)**:
   > Tatsuya Aoki, Akira Miyazawa, Tatsuya Ishigaki, Keiichi Goshima, Kasumi Aoki, Ichiro Kobayashi, Hiroya Takamura, and Yusuke Miyao. *Generating market comments referring to external resources*. In Proceedings of the 11th International Conference on Natural Language Generation, pages 135–139, Tilburg University, The Netherlands, 2018.

3. **Dataset from Hamazono et al. (2021)**:
   > Yumi Hamazono, Tatsuya Ishigaki, Yusuke Miyao, Hiroya Takamura, and Ichiro Kobayashi. *Unpredictable attributes in market comment generation*. In Proceedings of the 35th Pacific Asia Conference on Language, Information and Computation, pages 217–226, Shanghai, China, 2021.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
