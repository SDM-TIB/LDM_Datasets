To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Detecting Compromised IoT Devices Using Autoencoders with Sequential Hypothesis Testing" by Md Mainuddin, Zhenhai Duan, and Yingfei Dong, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and evaluation sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that the evaluation studies are based on the **N-BaIoT dataset**, which indicates that this is a key dataset used in the research.

Next, I will look for specific details about the **N-BaIoT dataset** in the **evaluation section**. Here, the authors describe the dataset as containing both benign and attack traffic from various IoT devices, including specific device types and the nature of the data collected. They mention that the dataset includes traffic from devices infected with Mirai and Bashlite malware, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's context.

In the **evaluation studies section**, the authors provide a detailed description of the dataset's features, including the number of features and the types of data points collected. They also mention how the dataset was partitioned for training, validation, and testing purposes, which is important for understanding its application in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the **N-BaIoT dataset**. The relevant citation is:

- For **N-BaIoT dataset**:
  > Yair Meidan, Michael Bohadana, Yael Mathov, Yisroel Mirsky, Asaf Shabtai, Dominik Breitenbacher, and Yuval Elovici. *N-BaIoT—Network-based detection of IoT botnet attacks using deep autoencoders*. IEEE Pervasive Computing, 17(3):12–22, 2018.

Having gathered all the necessary information, I will now compile the dataset entry for the **N-BaIoT dataset** with its full citation, ensuring that it is ready for any structured output or further processing.
