        "dcterms:description": "The real-time dataset used in this study consists of Blood Pressure values and corresponding voice signals collected from 25 participants. The participants selected for the dataset fall within the age group of 20 to 65. Out of 25, there are 12 men and 13 female participants, and it is discovered that Blood Pressure has an impact on seven of the participants. By examining patient auditory recordings, the dataset seeks to let doctors precisely determine each patient's Blood Pressure. Each participant's data in the dataset includes their Blood Pressure measurement, which typically consists of Systolic and Diastolic values, and the corresponding voice signal captured during the measurement process.",
