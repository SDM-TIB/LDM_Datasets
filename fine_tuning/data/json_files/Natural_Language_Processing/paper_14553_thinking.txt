To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Joint Design of Protein Sequence and Structure based on Motifs" by Zhenqiao Song et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on two biologically significant metalloprotein datasets, specifically **β-lactamases** and **myoglobins**. This indicates that these are the datasets I need to focus on.

Next, I will examine **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors provide more detailed information about the datasets. They describe how they collected data from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) and filtered it based on specific criteria, such as length filtering for β-lactamases (longer than 200 amino acids) and myoglobins (longer than 100 amino acids). This section confirms that both datasets are derived from PDB and provides context for their significance.

In the same section, the authors mention that they performed multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) using ClustalW2 and set positions with alignment frequencies above a certain threshold as motif parts. This detail is crucial for understanding how the datasets were processed.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets. The authors do not provide specific citations for the datasets themselves, but they do mention that they will release the created metalloprotein datasets in the near future. However, I can still provide citations for the original sources of the proteins:

1. **β-lactamases**: The authors refer to the significance of β-lactamases in the context of antibiotic resistance, but they do not provide a specific citation for the dataset. I will note that the dataset is derived from the Protein Data Bank (PDB).

2. **myoglobins**: Similarly, the authors discuss myoglobins and their biological significance, but again, no specific citation is provided. This dataset is also derived from the PDB.

Since the datasets are based on proteins from the PDB, I will include a general citation for the PDB:

- **Protein Data Bank (PDB)**: 
  > Berman, H. M., Westbrook, J., Feng, Z., Gilliland, G., Bhat, T. N., Weissig, H., & Shindyalov, I. N. (2000). The Protein Data Bank. *Nucleic Acids Research*, 28(1), 235-242. doi:10.1093/nar/28.1.235

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the relevant citations for each dataset based on the information extracted from the paper.

In summary, I have identified the two datasets (β-lactamases and myoglobins) and their source (PDB), and I will document this information along with the appropriate citations for the datasets.
