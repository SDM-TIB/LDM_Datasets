To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Two-level histograms for dealing with outliers and heavy tail distributions" by Marc Boullé, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that extensive experiments were conducted, which suggests that datasets are likely to be discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will look for specific sections that might detail the datasets used. In this case, I will focus on **section 6 (Experimental results)**, as it typically contains information about the datasets employed in the experiments. I will also check the **References section** for any citations related to the datasets.

Upon reviewing section 6, I find that the author mentions several datasets used for experiments:

1. **Gaussian Distribution Dataset**: This dataset is generated from a Gaussian distribution with parameters \( \mu = 1 \) and \( \sigma = 0.1 \). It is used to evaluate the impact of outliers on histogram quality.

2. **Gaussian Mixture Dataset**: This dataset consists of a mixture of two Gaussian distributions, specifically \( G(\mu_1 = 1, \sigma_1 = \mu_1/10) \) and \( G(\mu_2, \sigma_2 = \mu_2/10) \), where \( \mu_2 \) varies across a specified range. This dataset is used to assess the method's performance with heavy-tailed distributions.

3. **Uniform Distribution Dataset**: The paper also discusses datasets sampled from a uniform distribution to evaluate the performance of the proposed method against known distributions.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the **References section**. The citations are as follows:

- For the Gaussian distribution, the citation is:
  > Boullé, M. (2023). *Two-level histograms for dealing with outliers and heavy tail distributions*. Orange Labs - 22300 Lannion - France.

- For the Gaussian mixture distribution, the citation is:
  > Boullé, M. (2023). *Two-level histograms for dealing with outliers and heavy tail distributions*. Orange Labs - 22300 Lannion - France.

- For the uniform distribution, the citation is:
  > Boullé, M. (2023). *Two-level histograms for dealing with outliers and heavy tail distributions*. Orange Labs - 22300 Lannion - France.

Since the datasets are generated for the experiments and do not have separate publications, I will use the paper itself as the citation for all datasets.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and citation in a structured format for further processing.
