To extract datasets from the research paper titled "LOGO: A Long-Form Video Dataset for Group Action Quality Assessment" by Shiyi Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract introduces the LOGO dataset, which is specifically constructed for action quality assessment (AQA) and highlights its unique features, such as its multi-person long-form video format and detailed annotations. This indicates that the LOGO dataset is the primary focus of the paper.

Next, I will look into **section 3 (The LOGO Dataset)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset's construction, characteristics, and annotations. Here, they mention that the LOGO dataset consists of 200 videos from 26 artistic swimming events, with an average duration of 204.2 seconds. The section also describes the types of annotations included, such as action types and formation labels.

In addition to the LOGO dataset, I will check the **related work** and **experiments** sections to see if any other datasets are referenced or compared. The authors mention existing datasets in the context of action quality assessment, such as MTL Dive, UNLV Dive, and others, but they primarily focus on the LOGO dataset as a novel contribution.

Now, I will compile the full citations for the LOGO dataset and any other datasets mentioned in the paper. The LOGO dataset is described as follows:

- **LOGO Dataset**: 
  > Shiyi Zhang, Wenxun Dai, Sujia Wang, Xiangwei Shen, Jiwen Lu, Jie Zhou, Yansong Tang. *LOGO: A Long-Form Video Dataset for Group Action Quality Assessment*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2023.

For the other datasets mentioned in the related work, I will extract their citations from the references section. For example:

- **MTL Dive Dataset**: 
  > Hamed Pirsiavash, Carl Vondrick, and Antonio Torralba. *Assessing the quality of actions*. In Proceedings of the European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), pages 556–571, 2014.

- **UNLV Dive Dataset**: 
  > Andrew S Gordon. *Automated video assessment of human performance*. In AI-ED, volume 2, 1995.

- **AQA-7-Dive Dataset**: 
  > Paritosh Parmar and Brendan Tran Morris. *Learning to score Olympic events*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 20–28, 2017.

After gathering all this information, I will ensure that I have accurately captured the dataset details and their citations. Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring that each dataset is clearly defined and properly cited.
