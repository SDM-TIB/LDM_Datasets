To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Knowledge-Driven Cross-Document Relation Extraction" by Monika Jain et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental setup sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions a dataset called **CodRED**, which is a key indicator that there is a dataset relevant to the research.

Next, I will look closely at **section 4 (Experimental setup)**, where the authors provide details about the **CodRED dataset**. They mention that CodRED contains 11,971 entities and 276 relation types, along with specific statistics about the training, development, and test sets. This section is crucial as it provides both the name of the dataset and its characteristics.

In the **table (Table 2)** within this section, the authors provide detailed statistics about the CodRED dataset, including the number of positive and negative labeled facts in the training set, as well as the number of bags and text paths. This information is essential for a comprehensive understanding of the dataset.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the CodRED dataset. The authors reference the original paper that introduced CodRED, which is by Yao et al. (2021). The citation is as follows:
> Yuan Yao, Jiaju Du, Yankai Lin, Peng Li, Zhiyuan Liu, Jie Zhou, and Maosong Sun. *CodRED: A cross-document relation extraction dataset for acquiring knowledge in the wild*. In Proceedings of EMNLP 2021, pages 4452â€“4472.

Having gathered all the necessary information, I will summarize the dataset details:

1. **CodRED Dataset**: This dataset is specifically designed for cross-document relation extraction and includes a variety of entities and relation types, making it suitable for the experiments conducted in the paper.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format for clarity and future reference, ensuring that the full citation is included for proper attribution.
