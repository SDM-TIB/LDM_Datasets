To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-split configuration design for fluid-based thermal management systems" by Saeid Bayat et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any references to datasets used in the experiments or analyses.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** closely, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. I will look for specific names of datasets, their characteristics, and any relevant details about how they were utilized in the study.

In this paper, the authors discuss the use of various configurations and optimization problems, but they do not explicitly mention any publicly available datasets. Instead, they focus on the methodology and the results of their experiments. Therefore, I will need to check the **References section** for any cited works that may refer to datasets or methodologies that involve datasets.

After reviewing the references, I will note any datasets that are mentioned in the context of previous works cited by the authors. For example, if a dataset is referenced in a paper that is cited in this study, I will include that dataset along with its citation.

If I find any datasets, I will ensure to write down their full citations in the appropriate format. For instance, if the authors refer to a dataset from a previous study, I will extract the citation from that study and include it in my dataset entry.

Finally, I will compile all the identified datasets and their citations into a structured format for easy reference. If no datasets are explicitly mentioned in the paper, I will note that as well.

In summary, my steps will be:
1. Read the abstract, introduction, and methodology sections for mentions of datasets.
2. Focus on the experiments section for specific dataset details.
3. Check the references for any cited datasets from previous works.
4. Record full citations for any identified datasets.
5. Compile the information into a structured format for review.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and cite any datasets related to the research presented in the paper.
