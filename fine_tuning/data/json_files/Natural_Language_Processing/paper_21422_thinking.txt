To extract datasets from the research paper titled "RiskLabs: Predicting Financial Risk Using Large Language Model Based on Multi-Sources Data" by Yupeng Cao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract introduces the RiskLabs framework and mentions the integration of various financial data types, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (RiskLabs Framework)**, where the authors describe the data types and datasets used in their study. Here, they mention the **S&P 500 earnings conference call dataset**, which is a key dataset for their analysis. The authors provide details about this dataset, including its composition and the number of instances used.

In this section, they specify that the dataset consists of audio recordings and transcripts from the 2017 earnings conference calls of 500 major public companies listed in the S&P 500 Index. They note that the original dataset contained 2,243 conference calls, but they focused on 576 unique instances where the audio and text were accurately aligned.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the S&P 500 earnings conference call dataset. The authors reference the work by Qin and Yang (2019) as the source of this dataset.

The citation for the dataset is:
> Qin, Y., & Yang, Y. (2019). What you say and how you say it matters: Predicting stock volatility using verbal and vocal cues. In Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (pp. 390â€“401).

After gathering this information, I will summarize the dataset details and its citation clearly.

1. **S&P 500 Earnings Conference Call Dataset**: This dataset comprises audio recordings and transcripts from the 2017 earnings conference calls of 500 major public companies listed in the S&P 500 Index. It includes 576 unique instances where the audio recordings are accurately aligned with the text transcripts.

Now, I will compile the dataset entry with its citation in a structured format for further processing or review.
