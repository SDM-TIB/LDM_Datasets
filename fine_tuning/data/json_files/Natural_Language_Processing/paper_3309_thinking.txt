To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Vyakarana: A Colorless Green Benchmark for Syntactic Evaluation in Indic Languages" by Rajaswa Patil et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract introduces "Vyakarana," a benchmark for syntactic evaluation, and hints at the inclusion of datasets for various tasks. This suggests that there are specific datasets that I need to look for.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Vyakarana)**, where the authors describe the benchmark in detail. Here, they mention the construction of two new treebanks: **CG-HDTB** (Colorless Green Hindi Dependency Treebank) and **csCG-HDTB** (code-switched Colorless Green Hindi Dependency Treebank). This section provides crucial information about the datasets used for the evaluation tasks.

In **section 3.2 (Evaluation Tasks)**, the authors specify that they use the HDTB, CG-HDTB, and csCG-HDTB treebanks for four syntax-related tasks: PoS Tagging, Syntax Tree-depth Prediction, Grammatical Case Marking, and Subject-Verb Agreement. This confirms that these datasets are integral to their experiments.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The citations for the treebanks are as follows:

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
