To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Gradient-based Fuzzy System Optimisation via Automatic Differentiation – FuzzyR as a Use Case" by Chao Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental demonstration sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a general overview, but I will focus on the introduction and experimental sections for specific dataset details.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the advancements in fuzzy systems and mention various toolkits but do not specify any datasets at this point. Therefore, I will proceed to the **experimental demonstration section**.

In the **experimental demonstration section**, the authors specifically mention the **Iris dataset** as the dataset used for their experiments. They describe it as consisting of 150 instances and detail its attributes, which include sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width, along with the classification of instances into three species of iris flowers (Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica).

Next, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the Iris dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:

- For the **Iris dataset**, the citation is:
  > R. A. Fisher, “Iris,” UCI Machine Learning Repository, 1988.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and completeness.

The only dataset mentioned in this paper is the Iris dataset, and I will ensure to include its full citation as required. 

After gathering all necessary information, I will prepare the dataset entry for review or further processing.
