To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Query-Efficient Adversarial Attack Based on Latin Hypercube Sampling" by Dan Wang, Jiayu Lin, and Yuan-Gen Wang, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract mentions that various experiments are conducted on benchmark datasets including **MNIST, CIFAR, and ImageNet-1K**, which indicates that these datasets are likely to be important for the research.

Next, I will look closely at **section IV (Experiments)**, where the authors provide details about the datasets used for testing. Here, they explicitly list four benchmark datasets:

1. **MNIST**: This dataset contains 70,000 images of handwritten digits, each of size 28x28 pixels.
2. **CIFAR-10**: This dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class.
3. **CIFAR-100**: Similar to CIFAR-10, but with 100 classes containing 600 images each.
4. **ImageNet-1K**: This dataset includes 1,000 classes and images are rescaled to 224x224 pixels.

The authors also mention the specific number of images used from these datasets for their experiments, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **MNIST**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998.

- For **CIFAR-10** and **CIFAR-100**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical Report, 2009.

- For **ImageNet-1K**, the citation is:
  > Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, and Li Fei-Fei. *ImageNet: A Large-Scale Hierarchical Image Database*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 248-255, 2009.

Having gathered all the necessary information, I will now compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
