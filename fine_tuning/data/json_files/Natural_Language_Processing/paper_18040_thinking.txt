To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "NOTSOFAR-1 Challenge: New Datasets, Baseline, and Tasks for Distant Meeting Transcription" by Alon Vinnikov et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions two new datasets: a benchmarking dataset of 315 meetings and a 1000-hour simulated training dataset. This indicates that I should look for detailed descriptions of these datasets in the subsequent sections.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Training and Benchmarking Datasets)**, which is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets. Here, the authors describe the **NOTSOFAR Recorded Meeting Dataset** and the **NOTSOFAR Simulated Dataset**. 

1. **NOTSOFAR Recorded Meeting Dataset**: This dataset consists of approximately 315 unique meetings, each lasting around 6 minutes, recorded in various conference rooms. It includes multi-participant English conversations and is designed for benchmarking purposes. The dataset captures a wide range of real-world acoustic conditions and conversational dynamics.

2. **NOTSOFAR Simulated Dataset**: This dataset comprises about 1000 hours of simulated training data, designed to improve the authenticity of the simulation process for speech separation and enhancement. It incorporates real acoustic transfer functions recorded in actual conference rooms.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The paper does not provide specific citations for the datasets themselves, but it does reference other works that may be relevant for understanding the datasets' context.

For the **NOTSOFAR Recorded Meeting Dataset**, I will cite the paper itself as it is the primary source:

(2023). NOTSOFAR-1 Challenge: New Datasets, Baseline, and Tasks for Distant Meeting Transcription. *Proceedings of the [Conference Name]*.

For the **NOTSOFAR Simulated Dataset**, since it is part of the same challenge and described in the same paper, I will use the same citation.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and includes the appropriate citations. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets introduced in the paper, ready for further processing or review.
