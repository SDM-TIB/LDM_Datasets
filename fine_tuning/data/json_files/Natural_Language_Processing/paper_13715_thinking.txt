To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Gall Bladder Cancer Detection from US Images" by Soumen Basu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the paper discusses automated detection of Gallbladder Cancer (GBC) using ultrasound images, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used in their research. Here, I find two datasets mentioned:

1. **GBC US Dataset**: This dataset consists of 1,255 image samples from 218 patients, with 990 non-malignant and 265 malignant images. The authors note that the dataset includes image labels and bounding box annotations for malignant regions, although they only use the image-level labels for training.

2. **Kvasir-SEG Dataset**: This dataset contains 1,000 white light colonoscopy images showing polyps. The authors augment this dataset by adding 600 non-polyp images from the PolypGen dataset, as Kvasir-SEG does not include control images.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **GBC US Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Basu, S., Gupta, M., Rana, P., Gupta, P., & Arora, C. (2022). Surpassing the human accuracy: Detecting gallbladder cancer from USG images with curriculum learning. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pp. 20886–20896.

- For the **Kvasir-SEG Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Jha, D., Smedsrud, P.H., Riegler, M.A., Halvorsen, P., de Lange, T., Johansen, D., & Johansen, H.D. (2020). Kvasir-seg: A segmented polyp dataset. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Multimedia Modeling (MMM), pp. 451–462.

Now that I have the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their sources, which is crucial for any downstream analysis or reporting.
