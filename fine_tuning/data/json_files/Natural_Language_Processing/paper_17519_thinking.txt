To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Scalable Structural Representations for Link Prediction with Bloom Signatures" by Haoteng Yin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the research context and any datasets that might be referenced. The abstract mentions "five standard link prediction benchmarks," which indicates that datasets are involved.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors provide a summary of the datasets in **Table 3**, which lists the statistics for the datasets used in their experiments. The datasets mentioned are:

1. **ogbl-collab**: A dataset for link prediction in collaboration networks.
2. **ogbl-ddi**: A dataset for drug-drug interaction prediction.
3. **ogbl-ppa**: A dataset for protein-protein association prediction.
4. **ogbl-citation2**: A dataset for citation networks.
5. **ogbl-vessel**: A dataset for vascular networks.

I will then check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The paper cites the Open Graph Benchmark (OGB) as the source for these datasets. The relevant citation for the OGB is:

> Hu, W., Fey, M., Zitnik, M., Dong, Y., Ren, H., Liu, B., Catasta, M., & Leskovec, J. (2020). Open graph benchmark: Datasets for machine learning on graphs. *Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems*, 33, 22118â€“22133.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations. Each dataset will be described with its name, type, number of nodes, number of edges, average degree, and the citation.

1. **ogbl-collab**: 
   - Type: Homogeneous/Social
   - #Nodes: 2,927,963
   - #Edges: 30,561,187
   - Average Degree: 10.44
   - Citation: Hu et al. (2020)

2. **ogbl-ddi**: 
   - Type: Homogeneous/Drug
   - #Nodes: 235,868
   - #Edges: 1,285,465
   - Average Degree: 5.45
   - Citation: Hu et al. (2020)

3. **ogbl-ppa**: 
   - Type: Homogeneous/Protein
   - #Nodes: 4,267
   - #Edges: 1,334,889
   - Average Degree: 312.84
   - Citation: Hu et al. (2020)

4. **ogbl-citation2**: 
   - Type: Homogeneous/Social
   - #Nodes: 576,289
   - #Edges: 30,326,273
   - Average Degree: 52.62
   - Citation: Hu et al. (2020)

5. **ogbl-vessel**: 
   - Type: Homogeneous/Vesicular
   - #Nodes: 3,538,495
   - #Edges: 5,345,897
   - Average Degree: 1.51
   - Citation: Hu et al. (2020)

Finally, I will ensure that I have accurately captured all relevant details and citations for each dataset, as this is crucial for proper documentation and future reference.
