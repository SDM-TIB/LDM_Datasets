To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Targeted aspect-based emotion analysis to detect opportunities and precaution in financial Twitter messages" by Silvia García-Méndez et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on a labeled dataset, which suggests that a specific dataset is used.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Evaluation)**, where the authors describe the experimental dataset. They mention that the dataset consists of **5,000 tweets manually tagged** for their analysis. This is a crucial detail, as it confirms the existence of a dataset used for their experiments.

In this section, the authors also provide information about the dataset's collection process, stating that it was collected using the Twitter API from January 14th to June 21st, 2020. This gives me the temporal context of the dataset.

I will also check the **References section** for any citations related to the dataset. However, it appears that the dataset is original and not derived from previously published datasets, as the authors mention that it is available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request.

Now, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format. The dataset entry will include the dataset name, description, and citation. Since the dataset is original and not published elsewhere, I will note that in the citation.

The dataset entry will look like this:

- **Dataset Name**: Experimental Dataset for Financial Emotion Analysis
- **Description**: Composed of 5,000 tweets manually tagged as expressing financial emotions (opportunity, precaution, neutral). Collected using the Twitter API from January 14th to June 21st, 2020.
- **Citation**: García-Méndez, S., de Arriba-Pérez, F., Barros-Vila, A., & González-Castaño, F. J. (2024). Targeted aspect-based emotion analysis to detect opportunities and precaution in financial Twitter messages. *Expert Systems with Applications*. Available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request.

After compiling this information, I will ensure that it is formatted correctly and ready for any further processing or review.
