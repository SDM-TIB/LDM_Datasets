To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Cross-Modal Contrastive Features for Video Domain Adaptation" by Donghyun Kim et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions conducting experiments on "domain adaptive action recognition benchmark datasets, i.e., UCF, HMDB, and EPIC-Kitchens." This indicates that these datasets are crucial for the research.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** in detail, specifically looking for any descriptions or characteristics of the datasets used. In the section titled **4.1. Datasets and Experimental Setting**, the authors explicitly list the datasets:

1. **UCF Dataset**: This dataset is referenced as a benchmark for action recognition, containing videos of various human actions. The authors mention that it has 3209 videos with 12 action classes.

2. **HMDB Dataset**: Similar to UCF, this dataset is also used for action recognition and is noted to contain videos from the original UCF dataset, sampling overlapping classes. It has 51 action classes.

3. **EPIC-Kitchens Dataset**: This dataset is described as containing fine-grained action classes recorded in different kitchens from an egocentric view. It includes 8 action categories across three kitchens.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **UCF Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Khurram Soomro, Amir Roshan Zamir, and Mubarak Shah. *UCF101: A dataset of 101 human actions classes from videos in the wild*. arXiv:1212.0402, 2012.

- For the **HMDB Dataset**, the citation is:
  > H. Kuehne, H. Jhuang, E. Garrote, T. Poggio, and T. Serre. *HMDB: A large video database for human motion recognition*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2011.

- For the **EPIC-Kitchens Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Dima Damen, Hazel Doughty, Giovanni Maria Farinella, Sanja Fidler, Antonino Furnari, Evangelos Kazakos, Davide Moltisanti, Jonathan Munro, Toby Perrett, and Will Price. *Scaling egocentric vision: The EPIC-Kitchens dataset*. In Proceedings of the European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), 2018.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its full citation, ready for further processing or review.
