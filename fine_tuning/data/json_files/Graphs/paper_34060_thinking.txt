To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Unlearning Backdoor Threats: Enhancing Backdoor Defense in Multimodal Contrastive Learning via Local Token Unlearning" by Siyuan Liang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract discusses the use of multimodal contrastive learning and mentions the potential for backdoor attacks, but I need to look for specific datasets used in their experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention using a **500K subset of the CC3M dataset** for backdoor attack experiments. This indicates that the CC3M dataset is a key dataset for their research.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the CC3M dataset. The citation provided in the references is:
> Piyush Sharma, Nan Ding, Sebastian Goodman, and Radu Soricut. *Conceptual captions: A cleaned, hypernymed, image alt-text dataset for automatic image captioning*. In Proceedings of the ACL, pages 2556â€“2565, 2018.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets explicitly, I will conclude that the CC3M dataset is the primary dataset used in their experiments.

Now, I will compile the dataset entry with the full citation into a structured format that can be used for further processing or review.

In summary, the steps I followed include:
1. Reading the abstract and introduction to identify the context of the research.
2. Focusing on the experiments section to find specific datasets used.
3. Retrieving the full citation for the identified dataset from the references section.

This method ensures that I accurately capture the datasets and their citations as required.
