To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Inverse Renormalization Group of Disordered Systems" by Dimitrios Bachtis, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly referenced. The abstract mentions the use of inverse renormalization group transformations to construct configurations for lattice volumes, which suggests that there may be datasets related to lattice configurations or simulations.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **methodology** and **results sections**. In this paper, the author discusses the application of machine learning algorithms to generate configurations for lattice sizes, specifically starting from a volume of \( V = 8^3 \) and constructing up to \( V' = 128^3 \). However, the paper does not explicitly name any publicly available datasets or repositories.

I will also check the **references section** for any citations that might correspond to datasets used in the research. The references primarily cite foundational papers and methods related to spin glasses and renormalization group techniques, but they do not provide specific datasets.

Since the paper does not mention any specific datasets by name or provide citations for datasets, I will conclude that there are no formal datasets extracted from this research paper. However, I will note the key configurations and volumes discussed:

1. **Lattice Configurations**: The paper discusses configurations generated for lattice sizes \( V = 8^3 \) and \( V' = 128^3 \), but these are not datasets in the traditional sense, as they are generated through simulations rather than sourced from a dataset repository.

2. **Machine Learning Training Data**: The author mentions using configurations from various realizations of disorder for training the machine learning algorithm, but again, these are not explicitly named datasets.

In summary, while the paper discusses the generation of lattice configurations and the use of machine learning, it does not provide specific datasets or citations for datasets. Therefore, I will not be able to provide full citations for datasets as none are explicitly mentioned in the text.
