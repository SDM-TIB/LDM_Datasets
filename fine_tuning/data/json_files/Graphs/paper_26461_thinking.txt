To extract datasets from the research paper titled "EvoNet: A Neural Network for Predicting the Evolution of Dynamic Graphs" by Changmin Wu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the model is evaluated on several artificial datasets and real-world datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments and Results)**, particularly **subsection 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they mention both synthetic and real-world datasets, which I need to document.

In **subsection 4.1**, the authors describe the following datasets:

1. **Synthetic Datasets**:
   - **Path Graph**: Described as a sequence of graphs where nodes are added over time.
   - **Cycle Graph**: A sequence of graphs forming a cycle, with nodes added similarly.
   - **Ladder Graph**: A sequence of graphs that resemble a ladder, with nodes added at each time step.

2. **Real-World Datasets**:
   - **BTC-OTC**: A Bitcoin transaction network with 5,881 nodes and 35,592 edges, covering the period from 2010-11-08 to 2016-01-25.
   - **BTC-Alpha**: Another Bitcoin transaction network with 3,783 nodes and 24,186 edges, covering the same time period.
   - **UCI-Forum**: A social network dataset with 899 nodes and 33,720 edges, covering the period from 2004-05-15 to 2004-10-26.
   - **UCI-Message**: Another social network dataset with 1,899 nodes and 59,835 edges, covering the same time period.
   - **EU-Core**: A dataset with 986 nodes and 332,334 edges, covering the period from 1970-01-01 to 1972-03-14.
   - **DNC**: A dataset with 1,891 nodes and 39,264 edges, covering the period from 2013-09-16 to 2016-05-25.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper cites various sources for the datasets, particularly for the real-world datasets.

For the **BTC-OTC** and **BTC-Alpha** datasets, the citations are:
- > Srijan Kumar, Francesca Spezzano, VS Subrahmanian, and Christos Faloutsos. *Edge weight prediction in weighted signed networks*. In 2016 IEEE 16th International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM), pages 221–230, 2016.

For the **UCI-Forum** and **UCI-Message** datasets, the citations are:
- > Tore Opsahl and Pietro Panzarasa. *Clustering in weighted networks*. Social Networks, 31:155–163, 2009.

For the **EU-Core** dataset, the citation is:
- > Ashwin Paranjape, Austin R. Benson, and Jure Leskovec. *Motifs in temporal networks*. In Proceedings of the Tenth ACM International Conference on Web Search and Data Mining, WSDM ’17, page 601–610, 2017.

For the **DNC** dataset, the citation is:
- > Ryan A. Rossi and Nesreen K. Ahmed. *The network data repository with interactive graph analytics and visualization*. In AAAI, 2015.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
