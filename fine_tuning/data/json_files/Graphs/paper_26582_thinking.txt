To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Semantic Program Embeddings with Graph Interval Neural Network" by Yu Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and evaluation sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for evaluation. The introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets in relation to the research objectives.

Next, I will focus on the **evaluation section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this paper, the authors mention using datasets for tasks such as variable misuse prediction, method name prediction, and null pointer dereference detection. I will look for specific names of datasets and any relevant details about them.

In the **evaluation tasks section**, the authors explicitly mention the datasets used:

1. **ETH Py150 Dataset**: This dataset is used for variable misuse prediction and is described as containing Python programs. The authors mention that they generated buggy programs from this dataset.

2. **Java-small Dataset**: This dataset is used for method name prediction and is noted to be publicly available and previously used in related works.

3. **Custom Dataset for Null Pointer Dereference Detection**: The authors describe how they constructed a dataset for detecting null pointer dereference bugs by extracting bugs from various Java projects, including those from Bugswarm.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The citations I will look for include:

- For the **ETH Py150 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Veselin Raychev, Pavol Bielik, and Martin Vechev. *Probabilistic Model for Code with Decision Trees*. In Proceedings of the 2016 ACM SIGPLAN International Conference on Object-Oriented Programming, Systems, Languages, and Applications (OOPSLA 2016).

- For the **Java-small Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Uri Alon, Omer Levy, and Eran Yahav. *code2seq: Generating sequences from structured representations of code*. International Conference on Learning Representations (2019).

- For the **null pointer dereference detection dataset**, the authors do not provide a specific citation, but they mention using various sources including existing datasets and Bugswarm projects.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including their names, descriptions, and citations, into a structured format for clarity and ease of use in future research or applications.
