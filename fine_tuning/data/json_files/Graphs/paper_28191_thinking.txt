To extract datasets from the research paper titled "When Do Contrastive Learning Signals Help Spatio-Temporal Graph Forecasting?" by Xu Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections for any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method on popular traffic benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved. The introduction further elaborates on the issue of data scarcity in spatio-temporal graph forecasting, hinting at specific datasets used for experiments.

Next, I will look into **section 4.1 (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention two datasets:

1. **PEMS-04**: This dataset contains traffic flow data from 307 sensors in the Bay Area, covering a period from January 1 to February 28, 2018. It is noted that the dataset has 16,992 instances.

2. **PEMS-08**: This dataset includes traffic flow information collected from 170 sensors in the San Bernardino area, with data collected from July 1 to August 31, 2016. It has 17,856 instances.

Additionally, the authors mention a third dataset, **BAY**, which contains traffic speed information from 325 sensors in the Bay Area, spanning six months from January 1 to June 30, 2017.

To ensure I have the full citations for these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **PEMS-04** and **PEMS-08**, the citation is:
  > Zonghan Wu, Shirui Pan, Guodong Long, Jing Jiang, and Chengqi Zhang. *Graph WaveNet for Deep Spatial-Temporal Graph Modeling*. In Proceedings of the International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI), pages 1907â€“1913, 2019.

- For **BAY**, the citation is:
  > Yaguang Li, Rose Yu, Cyrus Shahabi, and Yan Liu. *Diffusion Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network: Data-Driven Traffic Forecasting*. In The 6th International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR), 2018.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
