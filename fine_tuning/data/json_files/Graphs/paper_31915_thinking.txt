To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Domain Generalization Deep Graph Transformation" by Shiyu Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the use of "two real-world datasets," which indicates that datasets are indeed present in the paper. I will look for specific names and descriptions of these datasets.

Next, I will navigate to **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly discuss the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention:

1. **Genes Dataset**: This dataset is derived from the Genotype-Tissue Expression Consortium, which includes gene expression data from various tissues. The authors specify that it involves five tissues: whole blood (WB), lung (L), muscle skeletal (MS), sun-exposed skin (lower leg, LG), and not-sun-exposed skin (suprapubic, S). They also describe how the gene-gene network was constructed using weighted correlation network analysis.

2. **Climate Dataset**: This dataset is extracted from the Goddard Earth Observing System Composition Forecasting, covering air temperature data across the US from 2019-2021. The authors explain that they split a day into four modes based on time periods and constructed a network using cities as graph nodes.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

- For the **Genes Dataset**, the citation is:
  > John Lonsdale, Jeffrey Thomas, Mike Salvatore, Rebecca Phillips, Edmund Lo, Saboor Shad, Richard Hasz, Gary Walters, Fernando Garcia, Nancy Young, et al. *The genotype-tissue expression (GTEx) project*. Nature genetics 45, 6 (2013), 580â€“585.

- For the **Climate Dataset**, while the paper does not provide a specific citation for the dataset itself, it references the Goddard Earth Observing System Composition Forecasting. I will note that the dataset is derived from this system, but a specific citation may not be available in the paper.

Now, I will summarize the datasets with their descriptions and citations, ensuring that I maintain clarity and accuracy in the information presented. This will prepare me for the final structured output that includes all necessary details for each dataset.
