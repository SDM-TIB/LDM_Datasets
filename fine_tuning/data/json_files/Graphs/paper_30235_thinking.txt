To extract datasets from the research paper titled "PointACL: Adversarial Contrastive Learning for Robust Point Clouds Representation under Adversarial Attack" by Junxuan Huang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview, and the introduction often highlights the datasets used for validation. 

In the **introduction**, the authors mention validating their method on downstream tasks, specifically **3D classification and 3D segmentation**. This suggests that datasets are involved, but I need to find their specific names.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In the experiments, the authors refer to two datasets:

1. **ModelNet40**: This dataset is used for 3D object classification. It contains 12,311 3D CAD models across 40 categories.
   
2. **S3DIS**: This dataset is used for 3D semantic segmentation. It consists of 3D point clouds of indoor scenes, providing annotations for various semantic classes.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **ModelNet40**, the citation is:
  > Wu, Zhirong, et al. "3D ShapeNets: A Deep Representation for Volumetric Shapes." *IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence*, vol. 36, no. 5, 2014, pp. 1-12.

- For **S3DIS**, the citation is:
  > Armeni, Iro, et al. "3D Semantic Parsing of Large-Scale Indoor Spaces." *Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)*, 2016, pp. 1534-1543.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
