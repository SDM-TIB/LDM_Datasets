To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CONE: Unsupervised Contrastive Opinion Extraction" by Runcong Zhao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the model has been evaluated on two datasets: a hotel review dataset and a Twitter dataset about COVID vaccines. This indicates that there are specific datasets that I need to identify.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically where the authors describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, they mention:

1. **HotelRec Review Dataset**: This dataset comprises hotel reviews from TripAdvisor. The authors note that it contains 10,000 documents with various sentiment distributions, but they do not use the overall rating during training.

2. **Vaccine Attitude Detection (VAD) Dataset**: This dataset consists of tweets discussing COVID-19 vaccines. The authors highlight that it contains 30,000 tweets and does not have any sentiment labels.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For the **HotelRec Review Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Diego Antognini and Boi Faltings. *HotelRec: a Novel Very Large-Scale Hotel Recommendation Dataset*. In Proceedings of The 12th Language Resources and Evaluation Conference, pages 4917–4923, 2020.

- For the **Vaccine Attitude Detection (VAD) Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Lixing Zhu, Zheng Fang, Gabriele Pergola, Rob Procter, and Yulan He. *Disentangled Learning of Stance and Aspect Topics for Vaccine Attitude Detection in Social Media*. In the 2022 Annual Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **HotelRec Review Dataset**: A dataset containing hotel reviews from TripAdvisor, consisting of 10,000 documents.
   - Citation: Diego Antognini and Boi Faltings. *HotelRec: a Novel Very Large-Scale Hotel Recommendation Dataset*. In Proceedings of The 12th Language Resources and Evaluation Conference, pages 4917–4923, 2020.

2. **Vaccine Attitude Detection (VAD) Dataset**: A dataset consisting of tweets discussing COVID-19 vaccines, containing 30,000 tweets.
   - Citation: Lixing Zhu, Zheng Fang, Gabriele Pergola, Rob Procter, and Yulan He. *Disentangled Learning of Stance and Aspect Topics for Vaccine Attitude Detection in Social Media*. In the 2022 Annual Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
