To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Leave No One Behind: Online Self-Supervised Self-Distillation for Sequential Recommendation" by Shaowei Wei et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that experiments were conducted on "four real-world datasets," which indicates that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper. This prompts me to look for the names of these datasets.

Next, I will navigate to **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors provide details about the datasets used. In this section, they explicitly list the datasets as follows:

1. **Beauty**: A subcategory constructed from the Amazon review datasets, with 22,363 users, 12,101 items, and approximately 200,000 actions.
2. **Toys**: Another subcategory from the Amazon review datasets, with 19,412 users, 6,041 items, and approximately 170,000 actions.
3. **Sports**: Also a subcategory from the Amazon review datasets, with 35,598 users, 18,357 items, and approximately 300,000 actions.
4. **ML-1M**: A well-known movie rating dataset comprising one million ratings, with 3,417 users and 11,924 items.

Now that I have identified the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The paper references the Amazon review datasets and the ML-1M dataset, which are commonly cited in the literature. 

For the **Amazon review datasets**, the citation is typically:
> Julian J. McAuley, Christopher Targett, Qinfeng Shi, and Anton van den Hengel. *Image-Based Recommendations on Styles and Substitutes*. In Proceedings of the 38th International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval, pages 43â€“52, 2015.

For the **ML-1M dataset**, the citation is:
> F. Ricci, L. Rokach, and B. Shapira. *Recommender Systems Handbook*. Springer, 2011.

With the dataset names and their citations in hand, I will now prepare to compile this information into a structured format for further use.

In summary, I have successfully extracted the datasets from the paper, identified their names, and located their full citations, ensuring that I have all necessary details for each dataset mentioned in the research.
