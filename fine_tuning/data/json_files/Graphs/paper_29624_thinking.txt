To extract datasets from the research paper titled "RecipeRec: A Heterogeneous Graph Learning Model for Recipe Recommendation" by Yijun Tian et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the creation of a new dataset called **URI-Graph**, which is a user-recipe-ingredient graph. This indicates that there is at least one dataset to extract.

Next, I will look closely at the **introduction** section, where the authors discuss the importance of large-scale food data and specifically mention the URI-Graph dataset. They describe how this dataset is constructed from recipes collected from Reciptor and user ratings from food.com, which provides context for the dataset's origin.

I will then proceed to the **Preliminary** section, where the authors define the user-recipe-ingredient graph and provide details about the URI-Graph dataset. They explain how they collected recipes and user interactions, as well as how they matched ingredients to nutritional information from the USDA database. This section provides critical details about the dataset's structure and content.

In the **URI-Graph Data** subsection, the authors provide specific statistics about the dataset, including the number of user nodes, recipe nodes, and ingredient nodes, as well as the types of relationships represented in the graph. This information is essential for a comprehensive description of the dataset.

Next, I will check the **References** section to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The URI-Graph dataset is primarily derived from the following sources:

1. **Reciptor**: The citation for this dataset is:
   > Diya Li and Mohammed J. Zaki. *Reciptor: An effective pretrained model for recipe representation learning*. In Proceedings of the 26th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery & Data Mining (KDD), 2020.

2. **USDA Nutritional Database**: The citation for this dataset is:
   > Agricultural Research Service. USDA. *National nutrient database for standard reference, release 27*. August 2019.

3. **Food.com**: While the paper does not provide a formal citation for food.com, it is a well-known recipe-sharing website and can be referenced as:
   > Food.com. *Recipe Sharing Website*. Available at: https://www.food.com.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly describes each dataset, ensuring that the full citations are included for reference.

In summary, the key dataset extracted from the paper is the **URI-Graph**, and the relevant citations have been gathered to provide a complete overview of the dataset's origins and structure.
