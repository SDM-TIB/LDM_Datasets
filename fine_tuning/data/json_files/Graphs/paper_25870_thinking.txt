To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Building Usage Profiles Using Deep Neural Nets" by Domenic Curro et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors constructed a dataset from **236 publicly available Microsoft Word tutorial videos**. This is a clear indication that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** and **method** sections for more details about the dataset. In the introduction, the authors discuss the challenges of profiling user actions and mention the use of video tutorials as a data source. The method section provides further insights into how the dataset was constructed, including the extraction of salient video frames and the labeling of actions.

In **section IV (Pilot Study)**, the authors provide a detailed description of the dataset:
- The dataset consists of **236 Microsoft Word video clips** downloaded from YouTube, which contain tutorials on specific tasks such as changing the default font, choosing the number of columns, and adding page numbers. 
- The dataset includes various user interface changes and artifacts, and the individual frames are labeled based on the dominant user action.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The authors provide a specific reference for their dataset:
- The citation for the dataset is:
  > Curro, D., Derpanis, K. G., & Miranskyy, A. V. (2017). *User-profiling dataset*. Zenodo. https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.321921.

With this information, I can summarize the dataset as follows:
1. **Dataset Name**: User-profiling dataset
   - **Description**: A dataset consisting of 236 Microsoft Word tutorial videos downloaded from YouTube, containing user actions related to changing the default font, choosing the number of columns, and adding page numbers.
   - **Full Citation**: Curro, D., Derpanis, K. G., & Miranskyy, A. V. (2017). *User-profiling dataset*. Zenodo. https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.321921.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This systematic approach ensures that I have accurately captured the dataset details and their citations from the research paper.
