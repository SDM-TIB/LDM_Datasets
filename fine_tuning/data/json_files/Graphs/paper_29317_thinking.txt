To extract datasets from the research paper titled "RODD: A Self-Supervised Approach for Robust Out-of-Distribution Detection" by Umar Khalid et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the proposed method, RODD, is evaluated on an extensive suite of benchmark datasets for out-of-distribution (OOD) detection tasks. This suggests that there are specific datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for any explicit mentions of datasets. The introduction discusses the importance of OOD detection and references various studies, but I need to look for specific dataset names.

Moving on to **section 3.1 (Datasets and Architecture)**, I will find detailed information about the datasets used in the experiments. Here, the authors mention using **CIFAR-10** and **CIFAR-100** as in-distribution (ID) datasets, along with seven OOD datasets: **TinyImageNet-crop (TINc)**, **TinyImageNet-resize (TINr)**, **LSUN-resize (LSUN-r)**, **Places**, **Textures**, **SVHN**, and **iSUN**. This section provides a clear list of datasets utilized in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned. The citations are as follows:

1. **CIFAR-10**:
   > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton, et al. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. 2009.

2. **CIFAR-100**:
   > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton, et al. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. 2009.

3. **TinyImageNet**:

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
