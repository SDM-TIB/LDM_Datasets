To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Comparison of gait phase detection using traditional machine learning and deep learning techniques" by Farhad Nazari et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of lower-limb EMG data for human walking, which suggests that a dataset related to EMG signals is likely involved. The introduction further discusses the importance of gait phase detection and mentions various methodologies, hinting at the presence of datasets used for these analyses.

Next, I will focus on the **Data Analysis** section, specifically subsection **II.A (Dataset)**, where the authors explicitly mention the dataset used in their study. Here, they refer to the "lower limb muscle activation EMG dataset from Mohr et al.," which is publicly available at the Mendeley Data repository. This is a clear indication of the dataset being utilized.

The dataset is described as containing EMG signals from five muscles from each leg, recorded from 61 participants walking for 49 gait cycles. This detailed description provides essential information about the dataset's content and structure.

Now, I will locate the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset mentioned. The citation for the dataset is as follows:
- Mohr, M., von Tscharner, V., Emery, C., & Nigg, B. (2020). *Data for: Surface EMG muscle activation patterns of the lower extremities during gait in individuals with and without a knee injury history*. Mendeley Data, v1. 

With this information, I have successfully identified the dataset used in the study and its full citation. 

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format for clarity and future reference. This includes the dataset name, description, and citation, ensuring that all relevant details are captured accurately.
