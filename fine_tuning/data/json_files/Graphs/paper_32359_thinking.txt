To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Gaussian Graph with Prototypical Contrastive Learning in E-Commerce Bundle Recommendation" by Zhao-Yang Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the datasets used for validation or experimentation.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of bundle recommendation and mention that they evaluate their method on several public datasets. This indicates that datasets are indeed used, but I need to find their specific names.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiment)**, where the authors typically detail the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they explicitly mention three datasets:

1. **Youshu**: A book-review dataset where bundles are represented as book lists that users may prefer. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Apurva Pathak, Kshitiz Gupta, and Julian J. McAuley. *Generating and personalizing bundle recommendations on Steam*. In SIGIR 2017, Shinjuku, Tokyo, Japan, August 7-11, 2017, pages 1073–1076. ACM, 2017.

2. **NetEase**: A music dataset where playlists composed of songs act as bundles. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Tao Zhu, Patrick Harrington, Junjun Li, and Lei Tang. *Bundle recommendation in ecommerce*. In SIGIR 2014, Gold Coast, QLD, Australia - July 06 - 11, 2014, pages 657–666. ACM, 2014.

3. **iFashion**: An outfit dataset where outfits are made up of individual fashion items treated as bundles. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Wen Chen, Pipei Huang, Jiaming Xu, Xin Guo, Cheng Guo, Fei Sun, Chao Li, Andreas Pfadler, Huan Zhao, and Binqiang Zhao. *POG: personalized outfit generation for fashion recommendation at Alibaba iFashion*. In KDD 2019, Anchorage, AK, USA, August 4-8, 2019, pages 2662–2670. ACM, 2019.

After identifying these datasets, I will also check the **References section** to ensure that I have the correct citations and any additional details that may be relevant.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including their names and citations, into a structured format for easy reference and further processing. This ensures that I have accurately captured all necessary details regarding the datasets used in the research paper.
