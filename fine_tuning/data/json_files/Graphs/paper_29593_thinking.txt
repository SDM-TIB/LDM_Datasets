To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Robust Reinforcement Learning on Graphs for Logistics Optimization" by Zangir Iklassov and Dmitrii Medvedev, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, but I need to look for specific datasets used in their experiments.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the application of reinforcement learning and graph neural networks in logistics optimization. They mention analyzing existing literature and reimplementing state-of-the-art models on different datasets. However, they do not specify any datasets in this section.

Next, I will examine the **methodology section** where the authors describe their experimental setup. They mention using a simulation environment based on the Manhattan district represented in k x k grids, where each grid corresponds to a station in New York City. This indicates that the dataset is derived from a synthetic simulation rather than a publicly available dataset.

In the **results section**, the authors present performance metrics for various models tested on the New York 4x4 and 20x20 grid environments. They provide tables comparing the performance of different algorithms, but again, they do not reference any external datasets.

Since the paper does not cite any specific datasets from external sources, I will note that the primary dataset used is a synthetic dataset created for the purpose of their experiments, based on the New York transportation network.

Now, I will compile the information regarding the dataset:

1. **Synthetic Dataset for New York Transportation Network**: This dataset is generated from a simulation of the Manhattan district, represented as a graph with nodes as stations and edges as connections between them. The dataset includes information about vehicle availability and passenger demand.

Since there are no external datasets cited in the references, I will not be able to provide full citations for any datasets. The authors primarily rely on their own generated data for the experiments.

In conclusion, I will summarize the findings regarding the dataset used in the paper, noting that it is a synthetic dataset created for the study rather than a publicly available dataset with a formal citation.
