To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Graph4Rec: A Universal Toolkit with Graph Neural Networks for Recommender Systems" by Weibin Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on several datasets, which indicates that I should look for specific dataset names and details in the subsequent sections.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, particularly **subsection 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they explicitly list four datasets:

1. **RetailRocket**: This dataset includes user interactions such as examining, adding to carts, and purchasing records from an e-commerce platform. The authors mention that it contains over 4 months of data.

2. **Rec15**: This dataset was published in the RecSys Challenge 2015 and includes various user behaviors on e-commerce websites.

3. **Tmall**: Another dataset from an e-commerce platform, which contains multiple user behaviors, including clicks, purchases, adds to cart, and favorites.

4. **UB**: This dataset is a user behavior dataset collected from real e-commerce websites.

In the same subsection, the authors provide statistics for each dataset, including the number of users, items, clicks, purchases, carts, and favorites, which helps in understanding the scale and nature of the datasets.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets:

- For **RetailRocket**, the citation is:
  > RetailRocket. *E-commerce Dataset*. Available at: https://www.kaggle.com/retailrocket/ecommerce-dataset.

- For **Rec15**, the citation is:
  > RecSys Challenge 2015. *Rec15 Dataset*. Available at: https://recsys.acm.org/recsys15/challenge/.

- For **Tmall**, the citation is:
  > Tmall. *Tmall Dataset*. Available at: https://tianchi.aliyun.com/dataset/dataDetail?dataId=42.

- For **UB**, the citation is:
  > UB Dataset. *User Behavior Dataset*. Available at: https://tianchi.aliyun.com/dataset/dataDetail?dataId=649.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described accurately and that the full citations are included for reference. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
