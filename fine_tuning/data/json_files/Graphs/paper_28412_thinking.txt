To extract datasets from the research paper titled "WLS Design of ARMA Graph Filters Using Iterative Second-Order Cone Programming" by Darukeesan Pakiyarajah et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the proposed method and mentions experimental results, which may include datasets used for validation.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental results section**. This section typically contains detailed information about the datasets used in the experiments. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, descriptions, and any relevant statistics.

In this paper, the authors do not explicitly mention any specific datasets used for their experiments. Instead, they describe the methodology and the performance of their proposed method compared to existing methods. Therefore, I will need to check the **references section** to see if any datasets are cited indirectly through the works referenced.

Upon reviewing the references, I find that the authors cite several papers that may contain datasets relevant to their work. However, they do not provide specific datasets in their own paper. The references include works on graph filters and signal processing, which may imply the use of datasets from those studies.

Since no specific datasets are mentioned in the paper, I will summarize the findings as follows:

1. **No explicit datasets were identified** in the paper for the experiments conducted.
2. **References to other works** may imply the use of datasets from those studies, but specific datasets are not detailed in this paper.

Finally, I will compile the information regarding the lack of explicit datasets and the references that could potentially lead to datasets used in related works. I will ensure to note that the authors did not provide full citations for any datasets, as none were explicitly mentioned in the paper.

In conclusion, I will document my findings clearly, indicating the absence of specific datasets in the paper while referencing the relevant literature that may contain datasets related to the topic.
