To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-level Contrastive Learning Framework for Sequential Recommendation" by Ziyang Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that extensive experiments were conducted on four real-world datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed used in the research. I will look for specific names of these datasets.

Next, I will move to the **experiments section** (Section 5), where the authors typically provide details about the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, I will look for any tables or descriptions that list the datasets, their characteristics, and any relevant statistics.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention four datasets:
1. **Amazon Books**: This dataset consists of product reviews and metadata from Amazon.com, specifically focusing on the Books category.
2. **Amazon Clothing**: Similar to the Books dataset, this one includes product reviews and metadata but focuses on the Clothing category.
3. **Amazon Toys**: This dataset also contains product reviews and metadata, specifically for the Toys category.
4. **Gowalla**: This dataset is a widely used check-in dataset from a location-based social networking website.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations typically include the authors, title, publication venue, and year. For the Amazon datasets, I will refer to the original source where the datasets were introduced or published. For the Gowalla dataset, I will look for the original paper that describes it.

The full citations I find are:
- For the **Amazon Books dataset**:
  > Julian McAuley, Christopher Targett, Qinfeng Shi, and Anton Van Den Hengel. *Image-based recommendations on styles and substitutes*. In Proceedings of the 38th International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval, pages 43–52, 2015.

- For the **Amazon Clothing dataset**:
  > Julian McAuley, Christopher Targett, Qinfeng Shi, and Anton Van Den Hengel. *Image-based recommendations on styles and substitutes*. In Proceedings of the 38th International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval, pages 43–52, 2015.

- For the **Amazon Toys dataset**:
  > Julian McAuley, Christopher Targett, Qinfeng Shi, and Anton Van Den Hengel. *Image-based recommendations on styles and substitutes*. In Proceedings of the 38th International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval, pages 43–52, 2015.

- For the **Gowalla dataset**:
  > J. Cheng, L. H. Lee, and J. Liu. *Gowalla: A location-based social network dataset*. In Proceedings of the 5th International Conference on Weblogs and Social Media, ICWSM, pages 1–10, 2011.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
