To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Compositional Counterfactual Contrastive Learning for Video-grounded Dialogues" by Hung Le et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors achieved promising performance on the **Audio-Visual Scene-Aware Dialogues (AVSD)** benchmark, indicating that this is a dataset used in their research.

Next, I will look for specific sections that detail the datasets used, particularly focusing on any sections that explicitly mention datasets, such as **section 4 (Experiments)**. In this section, the authors state that they used the **Audio-Visual Scene-Aware Dialogues (AVSD)** dataset for benchmarking their video-grounded dialogue systems. This confirms that the AVSD dataset is central to their experiments.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the AVSD dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:
> H. Alamri, V. Cartillier, A. Das, J. Wang, A. Cherian, I. Essa, D. Batra, T. K. Marks, C. Hori, P. Anderson, et al. *Audio-Visual Scene-Aware Dialog*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 7558–7567, 2019.

Additionally, the paper references the **Charades dataset** as the source of videos used in the AVSD dataset. I will also look for its citation in the references. The citation for the Charades dataset is:
> G. A. Sigurdsson, G. Varol, X. Wang, A. Farhadi, I. Laptev, and A. Gupta. *Hollywood in Homes: Crowdsourcing Data Collection for Activity Understanding*. In European Conference on Computer Vision, pages 510–526, 2016.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will summarize the findings:

1. **Audio-Visual Scene-Aware Dialogues (AVSD)**: This dataset is used for benchmarking video-grounded dialogue systems.
   - Citation: H. Alamri, V. Cartillier, A. Das, J. Wang, A. Cherian, I. Essa, D. Batra, T. K. Marks, C. Hori, P. Anderson, et al. *Audio-Visual Scene-Aware Dialog*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 7558–7567, 2019.

2. **Charades Dataset**: This dataset provides the video content for the AVSD dataset.
   - Citation: G. A. Sigurdsson, G. Varol, X. Wang, A. Farhadi, I. Laptev, and A. Gupta. *Hollywood in Homes: Crowdsourcing Data Collection for Activity Understanding*. In European Conference on Computer Vision, pages 510–526, 2016.

With this information, I can now compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
