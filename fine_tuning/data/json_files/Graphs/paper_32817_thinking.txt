To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Mending of Spatio-Temporal Dependencies in Block Adjacency Matrix" by Osama Ahmad et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the proposed methodology demonstrates superior performance on benchmark datasets, specifically mentioning **SurgVisDom** and **C2D2**. This suggests that these datasets are crucial for the experiments conducted in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Results)**, where the authors explicitly discuss the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they provide detailed descriptions of both datasets:

1. **C2D2 Dataset**: This dataset is described as a remote sensing-based spatio-temporal dataset consisting of four classes: construction, destruction, cultivation, and de-cultivation. It includes temporal samples from the years 2011, 2013, and 2017, covering approximately 5310 km² with images cropped to 256 × 256 pixels.

2. **SurgVisDom Dataset**: This dataset is focused on surgical visual domain adaptation and consists of three classification tasks: needle-driving, dissection, and knot-tying. The training data includes 476 videos, with a mix of virtual reality and real-time clinical data, and specific methods for segmenting the training samples into frames for analysis.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:

- For the **C2D2 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > A, Z., et al. *Surgical visual domain adaptation: Results from the miccai 2020 surgvisdom challenge*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2102.13644 (2021).

- For the **SurgVisDom Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Bhimra, M.A., Nazir, U., Taj, M. *Using 3D residual network for spatio-temporal analysis of remote sensing data*. ICASSP pp. 1403–1407 (2019).

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets, I will prepare to compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing. This will include the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all details are accurately represented.
