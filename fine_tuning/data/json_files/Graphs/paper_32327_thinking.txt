To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Language-Enhanced Session-Based Recommendation with Decoupled Contrastive Learning" by Zhipeng Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors participated in the KDD CUP 2023 and utilized the **Amazon-M2 dataset** for their experiments. This is a clear indication that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (section 3) where the authors discuss their methodology and datasets in detail. In section 3.1, they explicitly mention applying data augmentation techniques to the **Amazon-M2 dataset** across different regions (UK, DE, and JP). This confirms that the Amazon-M2 dataset is the primary dataset used in their research.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the **Amazon-M2 dataset**. The relevant citation is:

- **Amazon-M2 Dataset**:
  > Wei Jin, Haitao Mao, Zheng Li, Haoming Jiang, Chen Luo, Hongzhi Wen, Haoyu Han, Hanqing Lu, Zhengyang Wang, Ruirui Li, Zhen Li, Monica Xiao Cheng, Rahul Goutam, Haiyang Zhang, Karthik Subbian, Suhang Wang, Yizhou Sun, Jiliang Tang, Bing Yin, and Xianfeng Tang. *Amazon-M2: A Multilingual Multi-locale Shopping Session Dataset for Recommendation and Text Generation*. (2023).

Since the paper primarily focuses on the Amazon-M2 dataset, I will ensure to include this dataset in my final output.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring that the full citation is included for the **Amazon-M2 dataset**. This will be crucial for proper attribution and reference in any downstream processing or documentation.
