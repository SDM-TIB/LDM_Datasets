To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Adaptive Least Mean pth Power Graph Neural Networks" by Changran Peng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the datasets used in the experiments. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on "two real-world datasets of temperature graph and traffic graph," which indicates that these datasets are crucial for the study.

Next, I will look into **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the datasets used. In this section, they specifically mention:

1. **Temperature Dataset**: This dataset consists of hourly temperature recordings collected from 197 weather stations across the U.S. It is described as a time-varying graph signal with 95 hourly recordings.

2. **Traffic Speed Dataset**: This dataset includes vehicle speed recordings collected from 157 inductive loop detectors on freeways around the Seattle area, with a total of 288 recordings taken at 5-minute intervals.

Both datasets are essential for evaluating the proposed LMP-GNN method, and the authors provide specific details about their structure and the context in which they were collected.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For the **Temperature Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Palecki, M., Durre, I., Applequist, S., Arguez, A., Lawrimore, J. (2020). *U.S. Climate Normals 2020: U.S. Hourly Climate Normals (1991-2020)*. NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information.

- For the **Traffic Speed Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Cui, Z., Henrickson, K., Ke, R., Wang, Y. (2020). *Traffic Graph Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network: A Deep Learning Framework for Network-Scale Traffic Learning and Forecasting*. IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
