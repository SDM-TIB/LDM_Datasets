To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CCL4Rec: Contrast over Contrastive Learning for Micro-video Recommendation" by Shengyu Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on "two micro-video recommendation benchmarks," which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will look into **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors typically provide detailed information about the datasets used in their experiments. Here, I find that they explicitly mention two datasets:

1. **MicroVideo-1.7M**: This dataset consists of 10,986 users, 1,704,880 items, and 3,239,534 interactions, with a density of 0.068%. It is used for micro-video recommendation tasks.

2. **Kuaishou**: This dataset includes 12,737,619 interactions and has a density of 0.042%. It is also utilized for micro-video recommendation.

In the **experiments section**, the authors confirm that these two datasets were used for evaluating their proposed method, CCL4Rec. This further solidifies the relevance of these datasets to the research.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets:

- For **MicroVideo-1.7M**, the citation is:
  > Chen, X., Liu, D., Zha, Z.-J., Zhou, W., Xiong, Z., & Li, Y. (2018). Temporal Hierarchical Attention at Category- and Item-Level for Micro-Video Click-Through Prediction. In *2018 ACM Multimedia Conference on Multimedia Conference* (MM 2018), Seoul, Republic of Korea, October 22-26, 2018.

- For **Kuaishou**, the citation is:
  > Zhou, K., Ma, J., Zhang, J., Zhou, J., & Yang, H. (2020). S3-Rec: Self-Supervised Learning for Sequential Recommendation with Mutual Information Maximization. In *CIKM*.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described accurately and includes the full citation. This will allow for a structured output that can be used for further analysis or integration into other systems.
