To extract datasets from the research paper titled "GLOBAL ATTENTION BASED GRAPH CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORKS FOR IMPROVED MATERIALS PROPERTY PREDICTION" by Steph-Yves Louis et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and while it may not explicitly mention datasets, it sets the context for the study.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, specifically **section 2.1 (Data Collections)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention using the **Materials Project database** to collect properties of crystal materials. This is a significant dataset for the study.

I will also look for any additional datasets mentioned in the **results section** or throughout the paper that may have been used for validation or comparison purposes. However, the primary dataset appears to be the Materials Project database.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Materials Project database. The citation is typically not provided in the same way as traditional datasets, but I will look for any relevant papers or resources that describe the database.

The citation for the Materials Project database is:
> Jha, D., Ward, L., Paul, A. A., Choudhary, A., Wolverton, C., & Agrawal, A. (2018). *ElemNet: Neural network materials classification using the periodic table*. Scientific Reports, 8(1), 17593.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry for the Materials Project database, ensuring to include the full citation as required.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry in the specified format, ready for further processing or review.
