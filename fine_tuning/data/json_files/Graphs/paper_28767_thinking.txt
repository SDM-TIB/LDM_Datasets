To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-Variant Consistency based Self-supervised Learning for Robust Automatic Speech Recognition" by Changfeng Gao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method on two datasets: **CHiME-4** and **AMI**, which suggests that these are key datasets for their experiments.

Next, I will look for specific details about these datasets in the **experiments section**. In the paper, the authors describe the **CHiME-4 corpus** as focusing on commercially-motivated scenarios with recordings in noisy public environments, and the **AMI corpus** as containing meeting recordings with multiple participants. This provides context for the datasets and their intended use.

In the **datasets section**, the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets:

1. **CHiME-4 Corpus**: This dataset consists of 6-microphone recordings from the WSJ0 corpus, focusing on real-world noisy environments. The total duration of the training corpus is approximately 18 hours.

2. **AMI Corpus**: This dataset contains around 78 hours of meeting recordings with three to five participants, recorded using independent headset microphones and multiple distant microphones.

Additionally, the authors mention the **Librispeech corpus** as a supplementary dataset used for training, which contains 1000 hours of close-distance reading speech.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This structured approach will help ensure that I accurately capture all relevant information from the paper regarding the datasets used in the research.
