To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Knowledge-Preserving Incremental Social Event Detection via Heterogeneous GNNs" by Yuwei Cao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract states that the authors conducted experiments on "large-scale Twitter corpus" and "event detection corpus," which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In the **experiments section**, the authors explicitly mention two datasets:

1. **Twitter Dataset**: This dataset is collected to evaluate the document-pivot (DP) social event detection methods. It contains 68,841 manually labeled tweets related to 503 event classes, collected over a period of four weeks.

2. **MAVEN Dataset**: This dataset is constructed from Wikipedia documents for general domain event detection. After filtering, it contains 10,242 messages related to 154 event classes.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper documentation. 

For the **Twitter Dataset**, the citation is:
> Andrew J McMinn, Yashar Moshfeghi, and Joemon M Jose. *Building a large-scale corpus for evaluating event detection on twitter*. In Proceedings of the CIKM. ACM, 409â€“418, 2013.

For the **MAVEN Dataset**, the citation is:
> Xiaozhi Wang, Ziqi Wang, Xu Han, Wangyi Jiang, Rong Han, Zhiyuan Liu, Juanzi Li, Peng Li, Yankai Lin, and Jie Zhou. *MAVEN: A Massive General Domain Event Detection Dataset*. In Proceedings of EMNLP, 2020.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will prepare to format this information according to the required structure for downstream processing. This includes ensuring that each dataset entry is complete with its name, description, and full citation.
