To extract datasets from the research paper titled "EPGAT: Gene Essentiality Prediction With Graph Attention Networks" by Joo Schapke, Anderson Tavares, and Mariana Recamonde-Mendoza, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and materials and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors benchmarked their method on four organisms, which suggests that datasets related to these organisms are likely included.

Next, I will focus on **section II (Materials and Methods)**, specifically the **Data Collection and Preprocessing** subsection. Here, the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments:

1. **Essential Genes Dataset**: This dataset includes annotations for essential and non-essential genes for four organisms: 
   - **Saccharomyces cerevisiae**: 5,636 genes (18.63% essential)
   - **Escherichia coli**: 3,686 genes (6.56% essential)
   - **Drosophila melanogaster**: 12,329 genes (1.95% essential)
   - **Homo sapiens**: 18,476 genes (9.88% essential)
   The dataset was obtained from the Online Gene Essentiality (OGEE) database.

2. **PPI Networks**: The authors utilized three different PPI networks for their experiments:
   - **DIP (Database of Interacting Proteins)**: Contains protein pairs experimentally shown to bind to each other.
   - **BioGRID (Biological General Repository for Interaction Datasets)**: Provides curated protein interactions reported in the biomedical literature.
   - **STRING (Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins)**: Assembles PPI collected from various evidence channels.

3. **Gene Expression Profiles**: The authors used gene expression data from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, specifically:
   - **E. coli**: GSE7326 and GSE40693
   - **S. cerevisiae**: GSE3431
   - **H. sapiens**: GSE86354
   - **D. melanogaster**: GSE67547

4. **Subcellular Localization and Orthology Information**: The authors gathered orthology information from the InParanoid database and subcellular localization data from the COMPARTMENTS database.

Now, I will check the **References section** to obtain full citations for these datasets:

With these citations, I can now compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing. This systematic approach ensures that I accurately capture all relevant datasets and their citations from the paper.
