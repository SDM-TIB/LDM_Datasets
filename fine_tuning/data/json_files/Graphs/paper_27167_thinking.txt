To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Hierarchical Reasoning Graph Neural Network for The Automatic Scoring of Answer Transcriptions in Video Job Interviews" by Kai Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors validate their model on a real-world dataset called **CHNAT**, which suggests that this dataset is crucial for their experiments.

Next, I will look for specific details about the **CHNAT dataset** in the **experiments section**. The authors provide a descriptive table (Table 2) that outlines the dataset's characteristics, including the number of candidates in the training, validation, and test sets, as well as other statistics like the average number of questions per candidate and the vocabulary size. This confirms that **CHNAT** is the primary dataset used in their research.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the **CHNAT dataset**. However, the paper states that the dataset will not be released to the public due to privacy constraints, which means I may not find a formal citation for it. Instead, I will note that it is a proprietary dataset used for the specific purpose of scoring answer transcriptions in video job interviews.

Now, I will summarize the findings regarding the dataset:

1. **CHNAT Dataset**: This dataset is used for evaluating the proposed model. It consists of answer transcriptions from video job interviews, specifically for sales positions. The dataset includes 2,313 training candidates, 289 validation candidates, and 290 test candidates. The average number of questions per candidate is 5.45, with a hireable label proportion of 63.30%. The total length of the dataset is 507 million words, with a vocabulary size of 21,128.

Since there is no formal citation available for the **CHNAT dataset**, I will note that it is referenced in the paper but lacks a public citation due to privacy constraints.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format for clarity, ensuring that I highlight the importance of the dataset in the context of the research while acknowledging the lack of a formal citation.
