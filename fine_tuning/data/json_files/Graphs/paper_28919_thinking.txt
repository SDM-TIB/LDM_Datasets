To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Self-Supervised Moving Vehicle Detection from Audio-Visual Cues" by Jannik Zürn and Wolfram Burgard, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and dataset sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors propose a self-supervised approach and mention a "real-world dataset," which suggests that a specific dataset is involved.

Next, I will focus on **section IV (Dataset)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset they collected. They introduce the **Freiburg Audio-Visual Vehicles dataset**, which contains over 70 minutes of time-synchronized audio and video recordings of vehicles, including more than 300 bounding box annotations. This section will provide the necessary details about the dataset, including its purpose, content, and structure.

I will also check the **conclusion and references sections** to ensure that I capture any additional datasets or relevant citations. The conclusion summarizes the contributions of the paper, including the dataset's availability, which is crucial for proper citation.

Now, I will compile the full citation for the **Freiburg Audio-Visual Vehicles dataset**. The authors mention that the dataset will be made publicly available with the publication of the manuscript, which is important for proper attribution.

The citation for the dataset is:
> Jannik Zürn and Wolfram Burgard. *Freiburg Audio-Visual Vehicles Dataset*. Available at http://av-vehicles.informatik.uni-freiburg.de.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the dataset details and ensure that I have the full citation ready for inclusion in any structured output or documentation.
