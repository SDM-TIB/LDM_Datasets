To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-axis Attentive Prediction for Sparse Event Data: An Application to Crime Prediction" by Yi Sui et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors validated their model on two publicly accessible urban crime datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically looking for any mention of datasets used for validation. In this section, the authors explicitly state that they used the **San Francisco (SF) Crime dataset** and the **Vancouver (VAN) Crime dataset** for their experiments. This is a crucial finding as it confirms the datasets utilized in their research.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The paper provides URLs for both datasets, which I will use to construct the citations:

1. **San Francisco Crime Dataset**:
   - Citation:
     > San Francisco Police Department. *Police Department Incident Reports - Historical (2003 - present)*. Available at: https://data.sfgov.org/Public-Safety/Police-Department-Incident-Reports-Historical-2003/tmnf-yvry

2. **Vancouver Crime Dataset**:
   - Citation:
     > Vancouver Police Department. *Open Data Crime Statistics*. Available at: https://geodash.vpd.ca/opendata/

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

- **San Francisco Crime Dataset**: A dataset containing historical crime incident reports from the San Francisco Police Department, covering various types of crimes and their geospatial locations over time.
  
- **Vancouver Crime Dataset**: A dataset that provides crime statistics from the Vancouver Police Department, detailing incidents and their locations within the city.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly presents each dataset along with its citation, ensuring that all necessary details are included for future reference or analysis.
