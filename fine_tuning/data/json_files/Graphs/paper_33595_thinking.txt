To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Full-Body Motion Reconstruction with Sparse Sensing from Graph Perspective" by Feiyu Yao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract discusses the challenges of estimating 3D full-body poses from sparse sensor data, which suggests that datasets may be involved, particularly in the context of motion capture.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any explicit mentions of datasets. The authors reference various studies and methods related to full-body motion reconstruction, but I need to look for specific datasets used in their experiments.

In the **methods section**, I will look for any subsections that detail the datasets used for training or evaluation. The authors mention using the **AMASS dataset**, which is a collection of motion capture data. I will note the specific datasets referenced in the experiments section.

In the **experiments section**, the authors state that they employed the **CMU (Lab 2000)**, **BMLrub**, and **HDM05** datasets from the **AMASS** dataset for their evaluations. This confirms the datasets used in their experiments.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the **references section** of the paper:

1. **AMASS Dataset**:

2. **CMU (Lab 2000) Dataset**:

After compiling this information, I will create structured entries for each dataset, ensuring that the full citations are included for reference. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
