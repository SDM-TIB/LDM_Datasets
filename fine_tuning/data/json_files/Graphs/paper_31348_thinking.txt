To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DEDGAT: Dual Embedding of Directed Graph Attention Networks for Detecting Financial Risk" by Jiafu Wu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the proposed methods achieve state-of-the-art performance on three financial risk control datasets, which indicates that specific datasets will be discussed later in the paper.

Next, I will look closely at **section 3 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they state that they evaluate their approach on three directed graph datasets: **Elliptic**, **Ant**, and **DGraphFin**. I will take note of the details provided about each dataset, including their purpose and characteristics.

The paper provides a brief description of each dataset:
1. **Elliptic**: This dataset is used to detect money laundering from transaction data.
2. **Ant**: This dataset is used to detect financial fraud from transfer records and is self-collected by the authors.
3. **DGraphFin**: This dataset is used to detect financial fraud from social networks.

In the same section, the authors provide statistics for each dataset, including the number of nodes, edges, labeled nodes, features, and classes. This information is crucial for understanding the datasets' structure and scale.

Next, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:

- For **Elliptic**, the citation is:
  > Weber, Mark, Domeniconi, Giacomo, Chen, Jie, Weidele, Daniel Karl I, Bellei, Claudio, Robinson, Tom, and Leiserson, Charles E. *Anti-money laundering in bitcoin: Experimenting with graph convolutional networks for financial forensics*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1908.02591, 2019.

- For **DGraphFin**, the citation is:
  > Huang, Xuanwen, Yang, Yang, Wang, Yang, Wang, Chunping, Zhang, Zhisheng, Xu, Jiarong, and Chen, Lei, and Vazirgiannis, Michalis. *DGraph: A Large-Scale Financial Dataset for Graph Anomaly Detection*. Thirty-sixth Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems Datasets and Benchmarks Track, 2022.

The **Ant dataset** is mentioned as self-collected, so it may not have a formal citation. However, I will note that it is used in the context of the paper.

Finally, I will compile the extracted information into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations. This will ensure that I have a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
