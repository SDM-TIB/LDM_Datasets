To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Clustering based Point Cloud Representation Learning for 3D Analysis" by Tuo Feng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the proposed algorithm shows notable improvements on famous point cloud segmentation datasets, which indicates that specific datasets are likely discussed later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments** section. In this paper, the authors discuss their experiments on several datasets, including:

1. **SemanticKITTI**: This dataset is described as a large-scale driving-scene dataset for point cloud segmentation, containing 43,000 scans with point-wise annotations collected from 22 sequences. The authors specify that they use sequences 00 to 10 for training and 11 to 21 for testing.

2. **S3DIS**: This dataset is noted as a famous 3D indoor parsing dataset, containing 273 million points collected from six areas and labeled with 13 classes. The authors mention using Area-5 as the test scene.

3. **KITTI**: This dataset is referenced in the context of 3D object detection, with 3D bounding box annotations for vehicles, pedestrians, and cyclists. The authors specify that they split 3712 scans for training and 3769 scans for validation.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **SemanticKITTI**, the citation is:
  > Jens Behley, Martin Garbade, Andres Milioto, Jan Quenzel, Sven Behnke, Cyrill Stachniss, and Jurgen Gall. *SemanticKITTI: A Dataset for Semantic Scene Understanding of Lidar Sequences*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2019.

- For **S3DIS**, the citation is:
  > Iro Armeni, Ozan Sener, Amir R Zamir, Helen Jiang, Ioannis Brilakis, Martin Fischer, and Silvio Savarese. *3D Semantic Parsing of Large-Scale Indoor Spaces*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2016.

- For **KITTI**, the citation is:
  > Andreas Geiger, Philip Lenz, Christoph Stiller, and Raquel Urtasun. *Vision Meets Robotics: The KITTI Dataset*. The International Journal of Robotics Research, 32(11):1231â€“1237, 2013.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this into a structured format for further processing or review.
