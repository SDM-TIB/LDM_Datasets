To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Path-Aware Graph Attention for HD Maps in Motion Prediction" by Fang Da and Yu Zhang, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the proposed model surpasses the state-of-the-art on the **Argoverse Motion Forecasting dataset**, which suggests that this dataset is crucial for the research.

Next, I will look for specific details about the dataset in the **experiments section**. In section IV, the authors describe the **Argoverse Motion Forecasting dataset** in detail, noting that it consists of over 200k five-second-long training scenarios labeled at 10Hz. This dataset is used for predicting the motion of an agent over the last 3 seconds of the scenario, given its motion and environment in the first 2 seconds.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Argoverse dataset. The relevant citation is:

> Chang, M.-F., Lambert, J., Sangkloy, P., Singh, J., Bak, S., Hartnett, A., Wang, D., Carr, P., Lucey, S., Ramanan, D., & Hays, J. (2019). *Argoverse: 3D tracking and forecasting with rich maps*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), June 2019.

Since the paper primarily discusses the Argoverse dataset, I will focus on this dataset for extraction.

Now, I will compile the dataset entry based on the information gathered, ensuring to include the full citation as required. This will provide a clear and structured output for the dataset extracted from the paper.
