To extract datasets from the research paper titled "End-to-End Binary Representation Learning via Direct Binary Embedding" by Liu Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the proposed method is evaluated on two large-scale datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 3), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they explicitly mention two datasets:

1. **CIFAR-10**: The authors describe it as containing 60,000 color images across 10 categories, with a training set of 50,000 images and a testing set of 10,000 images.

2. **Microsoft COCO**: This dataset is mentioned as containing 83,000 images with 605,000 annotations for image recognition, segmentation, and captioning, along with a validation set of 40,000 images.

To ensure accuracy, I will also check the **References section** for the full citations of these datasets:

- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, “Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images,” Tech. Rep., 2009.

- For **Microsoft COCO**, the citation is:
  > Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, Serge Belongie, James Hays, Pietro Perona, Deva Ramanan, Piotr Dollár, and C. Lawrence Zitnick, “Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context,” in Proceedings of the European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), 2014.

Now, I will compile the dataset information, including their descriptions and citations, ensuring that I have accurately captured all necessary details for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This will allow me to present a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.
