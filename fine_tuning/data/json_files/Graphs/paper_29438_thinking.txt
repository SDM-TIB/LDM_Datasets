To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Use All The Labels: A Hierarchical Multi-Label Contrastive Learning Framework" by Shu Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that experiments were conducted on several datasets, which indicates that I should look for specific names and details of these datasets.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention:

1. **ImageNet**: A large-scale hierarchical image database used for various classification tasks.
2. **DeepFashion In-Shop**: A clothing dataset with over 800K images, specifically using the In-Shop subset for experiments, which has three levels of labels: category, product ID, and variation.
3. **iNaturalist**: A species classification dataset with a hierarchical structure, including super-category and species categories.
4. **ModelNet40**: A synthetic dataset of 3,183 CAD models from 40 object classes, featuring two-level hierarchical labels: category and CAD image ID.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Olga Russakovsky, Jia Deng, Hao Su, Jonathan Krause, Sanjeev Satheesh, Sean Ma, Zhiheng Huang, Andrej Karpathy, Aditya Khosla, Michael Bernstein, Alexander C. Berg, and Li Fei-Fei. *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision (IJCV), 115(3):211–252, 2015.

- For **DeepFashion**, the citation is:
  > Ziwei Liu, Ping Luo, Shi Qiu, Xiaogang Wang, and Xiaoou Tang. *DeepFashion: Powering Robust Clothes Recognition and Retrieval with Rich Annotations*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 1096–1104, 2016.

- For **iNaturalist**, the citation is:
  > Grant Van Horn, Oisin Mac Aodha, Yang Song, Yin Cui, Chen Sun, Alex Shepard, Hartwig Adam, Pietro Perona, and Serge Belongie. *The iNaturalist Species Classification and Detection Dataset*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 8769–8778, 2018.

- For **ModelNet40**, the citation is:
  > Zhirong Wu, Shuran Song, Aditya Khosla, Fisher Yu, Linguang Zhang, Xiaoou Tang, and Jianxiong Xiao. *3D ShapeNets: A Deep Representation for Volumetric Shapes*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 1912–1920, 2015.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their full citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured all necessary details regarding the datasets used in the research.
