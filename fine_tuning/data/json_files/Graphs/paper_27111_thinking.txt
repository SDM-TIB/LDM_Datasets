To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Dynamic Structure Learning through Graph Neural Network for Forecasting Soil Moisture in Precision Agriculture" by Anoushka Vyas and Sambaran Bandyopadhyay, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors have curated two real-world soil moisture datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets and Experimental Setup)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention two datasets:

1. **Spain Dataset**: This dataset consists of 20 soil moisture stations from North-Western Spain, covering the years 2016-2017, with a temporal resolution of 15 days. It includes features such as NDVI from MODIS, SAR back scattering coefficients from Sentinel 1, and weather parameters like temperature and precipitation. The ground truth soil moisture data is collected from the REMEDHUS network.

2. **USA Dataset**: This dataset includes 68 soil moisture stations from the USA for the years 2018-2019, with a daily resolution. It contains 15 temporal features obtained from the SCAN network, which includes various weather and soil parameters.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The authors reference the following sources:

- For the **Spain Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Nilda Sanchez, José Martínez-Fernández, Anna Scaini, and Carlos Perez-Gutierrez. *Validation of the SMOS L2 soil moisture data in the REMEDHUS network (Spain)*. IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing, 50(5):1602–1611, 2012.

- For the **USA Dataset**, the citation is:
  > SCAN Network. *Soil Climate Analysis Network (SCAN)*. Available at: https://www.wcc.nrcs.usda.gov/scan/.

Now that I have the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use.

In summary, I will extract the following datasets with their full citations:
1. Spain Dataset
   - Citation: Nilda Sanchez et al. (2012)
2. USA Dataset
   - Citation: SCAN Network (n.d.)

This systematic approach ensures that I accurately capture the datasets and their respective citations from the research paper.
