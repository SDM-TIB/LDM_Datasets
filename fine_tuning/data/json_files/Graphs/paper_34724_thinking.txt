To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Mix-Domain Contrastive Learning for Unpaired H&E-to-IHC Stain Translation" by Song Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the proposed method is evaluated on two H&E-to-IHC stain translation datasets, which indicates that specific datasets will be discussed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 3), where the authors typically provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used. In this section, the authors explicitly mention two datasets:

1. **MIST (Multi-IHC Stain Translation dataset)**: The authors describe it as consisting of four subsets (HER2, ER, Ki67, and PR), with more than 4,000 image pairs for training and 1,000 image pairs for testing, all at a resolution of 1024×1024.

2. **BCI (Breast Cancer Immunohistochemical dataset)**: This dataset includes 4,873 H&E-IHC image pairs, with 3,896 pairs used for training and 977 pairs for testing, also at a resolution of 1024×1024.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **MIST**, the citation is:
  > Fangda Li, Zhiqiang Hu, Wen Chen, and Avinash Kak. *Adaptive supervised patch-wise contrastive loss for learning H&E-to-IHC stain translation with inconsistent ground truth image pairs*. In International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer-Assisted Intervention. Springer, 2023, pp. 632–641.

- For **BCI**, the citation is:
  > Shengjie Liu, Chuang Zhu, Feng Xu, et al. *BCI: Breast cancer immunohistochemical image generation through pyramid pix2pix*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2022, pp. 1815–1824.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the necessary details for each dataset mentioned in the paper.
