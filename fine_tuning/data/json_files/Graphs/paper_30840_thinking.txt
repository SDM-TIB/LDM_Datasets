To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SmartQuery: An Active Learning Framework for Graph Neural Networks through Hybrid Uncertainty Reduction" by Xiaoting Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on **three network datasets**, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention three benchmark datasets: 

1. **Cora**: A citation network dataset with 2,798 nodes, 5,429 edges, and 7 classes. The dataset has 1,433 features and a label rate of 0.0125.
   
2. **Citeseer**: Another citation network dataset with 3,327 nodes, 4,732 edges, and 6 classes. It contains 3,703 features and a label rate of 0.0090.
   
3. **Pubmed**: This dataset consists of 19,717 nodes, 44,338 edges, and 3 classes. It has 500 features and a label rate of 0.0008.

The authors provide a summary of the basic properties of these datasets in Table 1, which confirms their use in the experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. However, since these datasets are well-known benchmark datasets in the field of machine learning and graph neural networks, they may not have specific papers cited in the references. Instead, I will provide general citations for these datasets based on common knowledge:

- For **Cora Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Sen, P., Namata, G., Bilgic, M., Getoor, L., Galligher, B., & Eliassi-Rad, T. (2008). Collective classification in network data. AI Magazine, 29(3), 93-93.

- For **Citeseer Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Sen, P., Namata, G., Bilgic, M., Getoor, L., Galligher, B., & Eliassi-Rad, T. (2008). Collective classification in network data. AI Magazine, 29(3), 93-93.

- For **Pubmed Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Sen, P., Namata, G., Bilgic, M., Getoor, L., Galligher, B., & Eliassi-Rad, T. (2008). Collective classification in network data. AI Magazine, 29(3), 93-93.

Since these datasets are often referenced together in the context of citation networks, the same citation can be used for all three.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations into a structured format for further processing.
