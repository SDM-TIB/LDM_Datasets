To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Unsupervised Video Person Re-Identification via Noise and Hard Frame Aware Clustering" by Pengyu Xie et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that experiments were conducted on two video-based datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 3) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, they explicitly mention two datasets:

1. **DukeMTMC-VideoReID**: This dataset is referenced as a benchmark for video-based person re-identification. It is important to note the specific characteristics or details provided about this dataset in the paper.

2. **MARS**: This is another dataset mentioned for evaluation purposes. Similar to the DukeMTMC-VideoReID, I will look for any specific details or characteristics that the authors provide.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The citations I will extract are:

- For **DukeMTMC-VideoReID**, the citation is:
  > Yu Wu, Yutian Lin, Xuanyi Dong, Yan Yan, Wanli Ouyang, and Yi Yang. *Exploit the unknown gradually: One-shot video-based person re-identification by stepwise learning*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2018.

- For **MARS**, the citation is:
  > Liang Zheng, Zhi Bie, Yifan Sun, Jingdong Wang, Chi Su, Shengjin Wang, and Qi Tian. *Mars: A video benchmark for large-scale person re-identification*. In Proceedings of the European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), 2016.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly presents each dataset along with its citation. This will ensure that the datasets are accurately represented and easily accessible for future reference or analysis.
