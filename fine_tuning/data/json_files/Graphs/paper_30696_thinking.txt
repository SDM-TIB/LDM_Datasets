To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Understanding and eliminating spurious modes in variational Monte Carlo using collective variables" by Huan Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, but I will need to look for specific datasets in the main body of the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology and results sections**. These sections often contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used for experiments. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

In the **experiments section**, the authors may describe the datasets used for their simulations or analyses. I will pay attention to any tables or figures that summarize the datasets, as they often provide concise information about the datasets' properties.

If the authors reference any datasets from previous works, I will note those references as well. This is crucial for providing full citations later.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This may involve looking up the original papers or sources if the datasets are not directly cited in the current paper.

For example, if the authors mention using a dataset called "XYZ Dataset" and provide a reference, I will ensure to extract the full citation from the References section.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and ease of use.

Finally, I will ensure that each dataset entry includes the full citation, as this is essential for proper attribution and further research.

By following these steps, I will be able to extract and document the datasets used in the research paper effectively.
