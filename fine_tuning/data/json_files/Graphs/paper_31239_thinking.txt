To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Contrastive Learning and the Emergence of Attributes Associations" by Daniel N. Nissani, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the use of contrastive learning and attributes but does not specify any datasets. However, the introduction discusses the MNIST dataset, which is a well-known dataset for handwritten digits, and indicates that it is used to illustrate the authors' hypotheses.

Next, I will look for specific sections that might detail the datasets used in the experiments. In **Section III (Probing Our Hypothesis)**, the author explicitly mentions two datasets:

1. **MNIST Dataset**: This dataset consists of 60,000 training samples and 10,000 test samples of handwritten digits, covering 10 classes (digits 0-9). The author uses this dataset to check the separability of super-classes.

2. **Balanced EMNIST Dataset**: This dataset is an extension of MNIST that includes handwritten letters and digits, containing 112,800 training samples and 18,800 test samples across 47 classes. The author notes that this dataset provides a more challenging task for their experiments.

In the same section, the author describes how both datasets were augmented during training using elastic distortion, which is relevant for understanding the experimental setup.

Now, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **MNIST Dataset**, the citation is:
  > LeCun, Y. (1998). *The MNIST database of handwritten digits*. Retrieved from http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist.

- For the **Balanced EMNIST Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Cohen, G., Afshar, S., Tapson, J., & vanSchaik, A. (2017). *EMNIST: an extension of MNIST to handwritten letters*. arXiv:1702.05373.

Having gathered this information, I will summarize the datasets and their citations clearly, ensuring that I include all necessary details for future reference or processing. This will allow me to compile the dataset entries accurately.
