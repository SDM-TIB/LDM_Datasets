To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CORTX: Contrastive Framework for Real-Time Explanation" by Yu-Neng Chuang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the experimental results are demonstrated on **three real-world datasets**, which indicates that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention:

1. **Census Dataset**: This dataset is referenced as containing human social information with 26,048 samples for training and validating, and 6,513 samples for testing. It has 5 continuous features and 8 categorical features.

2. **Bankruptcy Dataset**: This dataset consists of 5,455 samples of companies for training and validation, and 1,364 instances for testing. Each sample has 96 features that characterize the companies and their bankruptcy status.

3. **CIFAR-10 Dataset**: An image dataset with 60,000 images across 10 different classes, where each image is 32x32 pixels.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **Census Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Dua, D., & Graff, C. (2017). UCI machine learning repository. Retrieved from http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml.

- For the **Bankruptcy Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Liang, D., Lu, C.-C., Tsai, C.-F., & Shih, G.-A. (2016). Financial ratios and corporate governance indicators in bankruptcy prediction: A comprehensive study. *European Journal of Operational Research*, 252(2), 561-572.

- For the **CIFAR-10 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Krizhevsky, A., & Hinton, G. (2009). Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images. 

Now that I have gathered the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or analysis. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets along with their proper citations, which is crucial for any research-related tasks.
