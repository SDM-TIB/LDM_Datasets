To extract datasets from the research paper titled "GNNBuilder: An Automated Framework for Generic Graph Neural Network Accelerator Generation, Simulation, and Optimization" by Stefan Abi-Karam and Cong Hao, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the framework and its capabilities, but I need to look for specific datasets used in experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental setup section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this paper, they mention using several datasets for performance evaluation, specifically:

1. **QM9 Dataset**: This dataset is referenced in the experimental setup where the authors discuss its use for evaluating the performance of their GNN models. The QM9 dataset is a well-known benchmark in molecular machine learning.

2. **MoleculeNet**: The authors also mention using datasets from MoleculeNet, specifically the HIV dataset, which is used for classification tasks in the context of drug discovery.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **QM9 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Wu, Z., Ramsundar, B., Feinberg, E. N., Gomes, J., Geniesse, C., Pappu, A. S., Leswing, K., & Pande, V. (2018). MoleculeNet: A benchmark for molecular machine learning. *Chemical Science*, 9(2), 513-530.

- For the **HIV dataset from MoleculeNet**, the citation is:
  > Wu, Z., Ramsundar, B., Feinberg, E. N., Gomes, J., Geniesse, C., Pappu, A. S., Leswing, K., & Pande, V. (2018). MoleculeNet: A benchmark for molecular machine learning. *Chemical Science*, 9(2), 513-530. (Note: The HIV dataset is part of the MoleculeNet benchmark.)

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets:

1. **QM9 Dataset**: A dataset containing molecular structures and properties, widely used for benchmarking machine learning models in chemistry.

2. **HIV Dataset**: A dataset from MoleculeNet used for predicting the activity of compounds against HIV, also part of the broader MoleculeNet benchmark.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
