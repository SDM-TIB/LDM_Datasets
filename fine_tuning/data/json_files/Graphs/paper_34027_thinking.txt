To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Weak Supervision with Arbitrary Single Frame for Micro- and Macro-expression Spotting" by Wang-Wang Yu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on several datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors mention three datasets: **CAS(ME)2**, **CAS(ME)3**, and **SAMM-LV**. I will note down the details provided about each dataset, including their characteristics and the context in which they were used.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide specific details about each dataset:
1. **CAS(ME)2**: This dataset consists of 98 long videos with an average length of 2940 frames, annotated with 57 micro-expression (ME) and 300 macro-expression (MaE) intervals.
2. **CAS(ME)3**: This dataset includes 956 videos with an average length of 2600 frames, annotated with 207 MEs and 2071 MaEs.
3. **SAMM-LV**: This dataset contains 224 long videos with an average length of 7000 frames, annotated with 159 MEs and 340 MaEs.

Next, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and will typically include the authors, title, publication venue, and year.

The full citations I will extract are:
- For **CAS(ME)2**:
  > W. Yan, Q. Wu, Y. Liu, S. Wang, and X. Fu. "CAS(ME)2: A database for spontaneous macro-expression and micro-expression spotting and recognition." *IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing*, vol. 9, no. 4, pp. 424–436, 2018.

- For **CAS(ME)3**:
  > J. Li, Z. Dong, S. Lu, S.-J. Wang, W.-J. Yan, Y. Ma, Y. Liu, C. Huang, and X. Fu. "CAS(ME)3: A third generation facial spontaneous micro-expression database with depth information and high ecological validity." *IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence*, 2022.

- For **SAMM-LV**:
  > C. H. Yap, C. Kendrick, and M. H. Yap. "SAMM long videos: A spontaneous facial micro- and macro-expressions dataset." In *Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Automatic Face and Gesture Recognition*, 2020, pp. 771–776.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This structured approach will help in accurately documenting the datasets used in the research paper.
