To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Scalable and Precise Representation of Program Semantics" by Ke Wang, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and evaluation sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that DYPRO is evaluated using a dataset consisting of almost 85,000 programs, which suggests that this dataset is crucial for understanding the paper's contributions.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Evaluation)**, where the authors describe the dataset used for semantics classification. They mention that the dataset consists of 84,165 programs sourced from a popular online coding platform, which is a significant detail. I will note the specifics about the dataset, including the diversity of programming languages (Java, C#, and Python) and the types of coding problems it covers.

The authors also explain the dataset preparation process, including how the programs were manually analyzed and labeled by a team of PhD students and exchange scholars. This information is essential for understanding the dataset's reliability and the effort put into its creation.

In the **subsection 4.1 (Semantics Classification)**, I will extract the following details about the dataset:
- Total number of programs: 84,165
- Languages included: Java, C#, Python
- Types of problems: Introductory programming exercises, coding puzzles, and algorithmic challenges.
- The dataset was split into training, validation, and testing sets, with specific numbers provided.

I will also look for any references to other datasets used in the paper, particularly in the context of loop invariants, as mentioned in **section 4.2**. The authors describe how they generated loop invariants and the methodology for creating a balanced dataset of positive and negative examples. This dataset consists of 20,824 examples, which is also important to document.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. However, since the datasets are primarily created by the authors and not sourced from external publications, I will focus on documenting the dataset details as described in the paper.

Finally, I will compile the extracted information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the paper itself as the source of the datasets. The citation for the paper is:
> Ke Wang. *Learning Scalable and Precise Representation of Program Semantics*. Visa Research, Palo Alto, CA, 94306. 

With this information, I will be ready to create detailed entries for each dataset, ensuring that all relevant aspects are covered and properly cited.
