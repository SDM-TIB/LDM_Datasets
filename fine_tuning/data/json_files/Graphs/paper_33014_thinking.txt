To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Novel Skip Orthogonal List for Dynamic Optimal Transport Problem" by Xiaoyang Xu and Hu Ding, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are referenced. The abstract mentions that the authors study a dynamic optimal transport problem and discusses applications in machine learning, which suggests that datasets may be involved.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors describe their experiments using both synthetic datasets and a well-known real-world dataset, **MNIST**. The MNIST dataset is explicitly mentioned as being used for evaluating their algorithm, which is a strong indication that it is a key dataset for their research.

I will also check the **bibliography** or **references section** to find the full citation for the MNIST dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:
> Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and CJ Burges. *MNIST handwritten digit database*. http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist, 2010. Accessed: 2022-07-29.

Additionally, the authors mention using synthetic datasets constructed from mixtures of Gaussian distributions. However, since these synthetic datasets are not formally named or cited, I will note that they are custom datasets created for the purpose of the experiments.

Now, I will summarize the findings:

1. **MNIST Dataset**: This dataset is a well-known benchmark in machine learning for handwritten digit recognition. It consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images of handwritten digits.

   > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and CJ Burges. *MNIST handwritten digit database*. http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist, 2010. Accessed: 2022-07-29.

2. **Synthetic Datasets**: These datasets are created by the authors for their experiments, specifically a mixture of two Gaussian distributions in R^784. Since they are not formally cited, I will note them as custom datasets without a specific citation.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
