To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Recipe2Vec: Multi-modal Recipe Representation Learning with Graph Neural Networks" by Yijun Tian et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors present a new recipe graph data called **Large-RG**, which is a significant dataset for their research. This is a strong indication that I should look for more details about this dataset.

Next, I will examine the **related work** and **preliminary** sections to see if there are any references to existing datasets that the authors may have used or built upon. In the preliminary section, the authors describe how they created **Large-RG** by collecting recipes from **Recipe1M** and crawling user ratings from food.com. This suggests that **Recipe1M** is also a dataset of interest.

In the **model** section, the authors provide further details about **Large-RG**, including its structure and the types of nodes and edges it contains. This section confirms that **Large-RG** is indeed a dataset created by the authors, and I will need to document its specifics.

I will also check the **experiments** section to see if any other datasets are mentioned in the context of their experiments. The authors do not mention additional datasets beyond **Large-RG** and **Recipe1M**, which they used to build their model.

Finally, I will consult the **references section** to gather full citations for both datasets:

1. **Large-RG**: The authors created this dataset, so I will describe it based on the information provided in the paper.
   - Description: A new recipe graph data with over half a million nodes, integrating visual, textual, and relational information.
   - Citation: Not applicable as it is a dataset created by the authors.

2. **Recipe1M**: This dataset is referenced in the paper and is used as a source for recipes.
   - Citation:
     > Javier Marin, Aritro Biswas, Ferda Oï¬‚i, Nicholas Hynes, Amaia Salvador, Yusuf Aytar, Ingmar Weber, and Antonio Torralba. *Recipe1m+: A dataset for learning cross-modal embeddings for cooking recipes and food images*. TPAMI, 2019.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the necessary details and citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research.
