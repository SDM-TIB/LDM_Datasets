To extract datasets from the research paper titled "BeMap: Balanced Message Passing for Fair Graph Neural Network" by Xiao Lin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. In the abstract, the authors mention conducting extensive experiments on real-world datasets, which indicates that datasets are involved. I will look for specific names or descriptions of these datasets.

Next, I will proceed to the **experiments section** (section 6), where the authors typically provide detailed information about the datasets used for their experiments. Here, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, characteristics, and any relevant statistics.

In section 6.1, the authors list four datasets used in their experiments:
1. **Pokec-z**: A social network dataset from Slovakia, where the sensitive attribute is the region of a user, and the goal is to predict the field of work.
2. **NBA**: A dataset containing information about NBA players, where nationality is the sensitive attribute, and the task is to predict player salaries.
3. **Credit**: This dataset includes customer information for credit card users, with age as the sensitive attribute and the label indicating whether a user will default on payments.
4. **Recidivism**: A dataset concerning defendants released on bail, where race is the sensitive attribute, and the goal is to predict the likelihood of committing a crime.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The authors often cite the original sources of the datasets they used, which is crucial for proper documentation.

The citations I will look for include:
- For **Pokec-z**, the citation is:
  > Thin Nguyen, Hang Le, Thomas P Quinn, Tri Nguyen, Thuc Duy Le, and Svetha Venkatesh. *Graphdta: Predicting drug–target binding affinity with graph neural networks*. Bioinformatics, 37(8):1140–1147, 2021.

- For **NBA**, the citation is:
  > Enyan Dai and Suhang Wang. *Say no to the discrimination: Learning fair graph neural networks with limited sensitive attribute information*. In Proceedings of the 14th ACM International Conference on Web Search and Data Mining, pages 680–688, 2021.

- For **Credit**, the citation is:
  > Yushun Dong, Ninghao Liu, Brian Jalaian, and Jundong Li. *EDITS: Modeling and mitigating data bias for graph neural networks*. In Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2022, pages 1259–1269, 2022.

- For **Recidivism**, the citation is:
  > Chirag Agarwal, Himabindu Lakkaraju, and Marinka Zitnik. *Towards a unified framework for fair and stable graph representation learning*. In Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence, pages 2114–2124. PMLR, 2021.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This structured approach will help ensure that I accurately capture all relevant details about the datasets used in the research paper.
