To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Analysis of Visual Features for Continuous Lipreading in Spanish" by David Gimeno-Gómez and Carlos-D. Martínez-Hinarejos, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and the section detailing the audiovisual corpus** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors present an audiovisual corpus compiled from a subset of the RTVE database, which is a good starting point.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Audiovisual corpus)**, where the authors describe the dataset in detail. They mention that the corpus is built from a subset of the RTVE database, specifically from the news program "20H" broadcast by Canal 24 horas. The section provides key details about the dataset, including the number of speakers, duration, and other relevant statistics.

The authors specify that the dataset includes:
- **Language**: Spanish
- **Resolution**: 480×270 pixels, 30 frames/second
- **Speakers**: 57 (17 males and 40 females)
- **Duration**: Approximately 3 hours
- **Utterances**: 2,792
- **Vocabulary**: 2,885
- **Running words**: Approximately 35,000
- **Phonemes**: 57
- **Words per utterance**: 23

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the RTVE database. The paper cites the RTVE database as follows:
> E. Lleida, A. Ortega, A. Miguel, V. Bazán, C. Pérez, M. Zotano, and A. de Prada. "RTVE2018 database description." Vivolab and Corporación Radiotelevisión Española, Zaragoza, Spain, 2018. [Online] Available: http://catedrartve.unizar.es/reto2018/RTVE2018DB.pdf.

Since the authors used a subset of this database, I will use the citation for the RTVE database itself as the authoritative reference for the dataset.

Finally, I will compile the extracted dataset information, ensuring to include the full citation for the RTVE database, which serves as the source for the audiovisual corpus used in the study. This will ensure that the dataset is properly documented and can be referenced in future work.
