To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Superpixel Perception Graph Neural Network for Intelligent Defect Detection of Aero-engine Blade" by Hongbing Shang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and dataset construction sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors constructed a simulated blade dataset with 3000 images and also used a public aluminum dataset for validation. This suggests that there are at least two datasets to extract.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Dataset construction)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they describe:

1. **Simulated Blade Dataset (SB dataset)**: This dataset consists of 3000 defect blade images, created through 3D modeling, printing, and laser machining. The authors mention that it includes five defect modes: cracks, burned, broken, nick, and overheated. The images are annotated with classification labels and localization information.

2. **Aluminum Dataset (AL dataset)**: This public dataset contains 3005 aluminum defect images with 10 defect types. The authors provide a link to access this dataset, which is crucial for citation.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. The simulated blade dataset is a homemade dataset, so it may not have a formal citation, but I will note its construction details. The aluminum dataset is referenced with a link, which I will include in the citation.

The citations I will compile are:

- **Simulated Blade Dataset (SB dataset)**: 
  > Constructed by the authors using 3D modeling, printing, and laser machining techniques. Contains 3000 defect blade images with five defect modes.

- **Aluminum Dataset (AL dataset)**: 
  > Available at: https://tianchi.aliyun.com/competition/entrance/231682/infomation. Contains 3005 aluminum defect images with 10 defect types.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets in a structured manner, ensuring that I include the full citation details for the aluminum dataset and a description for the simulated blade dataset. This will ensure that the datasets are accurately represented and can be referenced appropriately in future work.
