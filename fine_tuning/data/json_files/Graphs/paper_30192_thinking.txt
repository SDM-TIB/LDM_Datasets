To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Cross-Network Social User Embedding with Hybrid Differential Privacy Guarantees" by Lei Jiang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments on three real-world datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed present in the paper. I will look for specific names of these datasets.

Next, I will navigate to the **experiments section** (Section 5) where the authors provide detailed information about the datasets used. In this section, they mention the following datasets:

1. **Foursquare-Twitter Dataset**: This dataset includes user interactions from both Foursquare and Twitter, with a total of 5,392 users from Foursquare and 5,223 users from Twitter. The dataset contains 48,756 posts and 76,972 friendship relationships.

2. **Weibo Dataset**: This dataset is divided into two sub-networks:
   - **Sub-Weibo1**: Contains 8,117 users, 158,823 posts, and 12,000 friendship relationships.
   - **Sub-Weibo2**: Contains 8,539 users, 153,741 posts, and 12,000 friendship relationships.

The authors also provide statistics about the datasets in a table (Table 1), which includes the number of users, posts, and relationships for each dataset.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. However, the paper does not provide specific citations for the datasets themselves, as they are likely derived from publicly available social media platforms. Therefore, I will note that the datasets are sourced from Foursquare, Twitter, and Weibo, and I will provide a general citation format for these platforms.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with the relevant details:

- **Foursquare-Twitter Dataset**: 
  - Description: A dataset containing user interactions from Foursquare and Twitter.
  - Source: Foursquare and Twitter.

- **Weibo Dataset**: 
  - Description: A dataset containing user interactions from the Weibo platform, divided into two sub-networks.
  - Source: Weibo.

Finally, I will ensure that I have captured all necessary details and citations accurately before preparing the structured output for review or further processing.
