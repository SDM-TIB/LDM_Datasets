To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Bike Sharing Demand Prediction based on Knowledge Sharing across Modes: A Graph-based Deep Learning Approach" by Yuebing Liang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the datasets used in the study. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments using real-world bike sharing, subway, and ride-hailing data from New York City. This indicates that multiple datasets are involved.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **data description** section, which is typically where authors provide detailed information about the datasets used in their experiments. In this paper, the **Experiments** section contains a subsection titled **Data Description**, which outlines the datasets utilized.

In this subsection, the authors specify three datasets:

1. **NYC Citi Bike**: This dataset includes the pick-up and drop-off times and stations for each Citi Bike trip record. The authors filtered the data to retain 246 BSS stations based on certain criteria.

2. **NYC Subway**: This dataset contains entry and exit counts for each turnstile in subway stations, aggregated every four hours. The authors filtered this dataset to include 107 subway stations.

3. **NYC Ride-hailing**: This dataset consists of for-hire vehicle (FHV) data from the NYC Taxi & Limousine Commission, which includes pick-up and drop-off times and zones for each trip record. The dataset includes 63 TLC zones in Manhattan.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. However, since these datasets are publicly available datasets rather than papers, I will provide the relevant information about their sources instead:

- For **NYC Citi Bike**, the dataset can be accessed through the NYC Open Data portal, which provides public access to various datasets related to city services.

- For **NYC Subway**, the dataset is also available through the NYC Open Data portal, specifically under the MTA (Metropolitan Transportation Authority) datasets.

- For **NYC Ride-hailing**, the data is provided by the NYC Taxi & Limousine Commission (TLC) and can be found on the NYC Open Data portal as well.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the relevant details and sources for each dataset in a structured format for further processing or review.
