To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Reversible Graph Neural Network-based Reaction Distribution Learning for Multiple Appropriate Facial Reactions Generation" by Tong Xu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for evaluation.

In the **introduction**, I will look for any statements that indicate the use of specific datasets or benchmarks. This section often outlines the context of the research and may highlight the datasets that are central to the study.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically **section 5.1 (Experimental settings)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention two datasets: 

1. **NoXI Dataset**: This dataset is used for evaluating the proposed approach and is described as containing multimodal recordings of mediated novice-expert interactions.

2. **RECOLA Dataset**: This dataset is also mentioned as part of the evaluation, although the authors note that it has only three valid video pairs, which limits its individual use in experiments.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations I find are:

- For the **NoXI Dataset**:
  > Cafaro, A., Wagner, J., Baur, T., Dermouche, S., Torres Torres, M., Pelachaud, C., AndrÃ©, E., & Valstar, M. (2017). The NoXI database: multimodal recordings of mediated novice-expert interactions. In Proceedings of the 19th ACM International Conference on Multimodal Interaction (pp. 350-359).

- For the **RECOLA Dataset**:
  > Ringeval, F., Sonderegger, A., Sauer, J., & Lalanne, D. (2013). Introducing the RECOLA multimodal corpus of remote collaborative and affective interactions. In 2013 10th IEEE international conference and workshops on automatic face and gesture recognition (FG) (pp. 1-8).

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all necessary details are captured for future reference or analysis.
