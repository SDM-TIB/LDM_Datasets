To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Augmentation-Free Graph Contrastive Learning with Performance Guarantee" by Haonan Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions "extensive experiments on 14 benchmark datasets," which indicates that multiple datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors provide details about the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they explicitly list the datasets, which include:

1. **Cora**: A citation network dataset with 2,708 nodes and 5,429 edges, used for node classification.
2. **CiteSeer**: Another citation network dataset with 3,327 nodes and 4,732 edges.
3. **PubMed**: A dataset with 19,717 nodes and 44,338 edges, also used for node classification.
4. **WikiCS**: A dataset with 11,701 nodes and 287,326 edges.
5. **Amazon-Computers**: Contains 13,752 nodes and 574,418 edges.
6. **Amazon-Photo**: A dataset with 7,650 nodes and 216,123 edges.
7. **Coauthor-CS**: A dataset with 18,333 nodes and 327,576 edges.
8. **Coauthor-Physics**: Contains 34,493 nodes and 991,848 edges.
9. **Chameleon**: A heterophilic graph dataset with 2,277 nodes and 36,101 edges.
10. **Squirrel**: Another heterophilic graph dataset with 5,201 nodes and 216,933 edges.
11. **Actor**: A dataset with 7,600 nodes and 33,544 edges.
12. **Twitch-DE**: Contains 9,498 nodes and 6,797,557 edges.
13. **Twitch-gamers**: A dataset with 421,961 nodes and 984,979 edges.
14. **Genius**: A dataset with 168,114 nodes and 6,797,557 edges.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations of the datasets. The paper does not provide specific citations for each dataset, but I can reference the general sources for the datasets based on common knowledge in the field:

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations into a structured format for further processing.
