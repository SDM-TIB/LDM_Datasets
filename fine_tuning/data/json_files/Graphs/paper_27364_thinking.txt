To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Efficient and Interpretable Robot Manipulation with Graph Neural Networks" by Yixin Lin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments using a GNN policy trained on expert demonstrations, which suggests that there are datasets involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section V) where the authors describe their experimental setup. They mention using expert demonstrations for training the GNN policy, specifically stating that they trained on 20 expert demonstrations for block stacking and 5 for dishwasher loading. This indicates that there are datasets derived from these demonstrations.

In the experiments, the authors describe various tasks and environments, such as:

1. **Block Stacking**: The authors mention using K blocks initialized in random locations, which implies that they have a dataset of expert demonstrations for this task.

2. **Box Rearrangement**: This task involves moving blocks between two boxes, indicating another dataset of expert demonstrations.

3. **Dishwasher Loading**: The authors created a dishwasher environment using a point-and-click interface to generate training data from expert demonstrations. This suggests a specific dataset for the dishwasher loading task.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. The paper does not provide explicit citations for the datasets used, but it does reference the environments and methods used to create the datasets.

For the **Block Stacking and Box Rearrangement** tasks, the datasets are derived from the authors' own expert demonstrations, so I will note that they are not publicly available datasets but rather created for the purpose of this research.

For the **Dishwasher Loading** task, the authors mention using the Replica Synthetic - Apartment 0 dataset for creating the dishwasher environment. I will look for the citation for this dataset.

The citation for the Replica Synthetic dataset is:
> Szot, A., Clegg, A., Undersander, E., Wijmans, E., Zhao, Y., Turner, J., Maestre, N., Mukadam, M., Chaplot, D., & Maksymets, O. (2021). *Habitat 2.0: Training home assistants to rearrange their habitat*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2106.14405.

Now, I will summarize the datasets identified:

1. **Block Stacking Dataset**: Expert demonstrations for block stacking tasks, created by the authors.
2. **Box Rearrangement Dataset**: Expert demonstrations for box rearrangement tasks, created by the authors.
3. **Dishwasher Loading Dataset**: Generated using the Replica Synthetic - Apartment 0 dataset.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations into a structured format for further processing.
