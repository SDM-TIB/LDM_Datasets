To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks for End-to-End Traffic Assignment and Traffic Flow Learning" by Tong Liu and Hadi Meidani, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of heterogeneous graph neural networks for traffic assignment and flow learning, which suggests that datasets related to traffic flow or transportation networks may be involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their numerical experiments. In this section, they mention conducting experiments on three urban transportation networks: **Sioux Falls**, **East Massachusetts (EMA)**, and **Anaheim**. I will note the details provided about these datasets, including their characteristics and any relevant statistics.

In **Table 1**, the authors provide specific information about the networks, including the number of nodes (|V|), edges (|E|), average degree, and OD demand for each network. This information is crucial for understanding the datasets used in their experiments.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The authors reference a source for the transportation networks, which is essential for proper citation. The citation for the dataset is:

- For the transportation networks:
  > Bar-Gera, H., Stabler, B., Sall, E. (2023). Transportation networks for research core team. *Transportation Network Test Problems*. Available online: https://github.com/bstabler/TransportationNetworks (accessed on May 14, 2023).

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset. The datasets identified are:

1. **Sioux Falls Network**: A transportation network with 24 nodes, 76 edges, and an average OD demand of 188,960.
2. **East Massachusetts (EMA) Network**: A transportation network with 74 nodes, 258 edges, and an average OD demand of 132,106.
3. **Anaheim Network**: A transportation network with 416 nodes, 914 edges, and an average OD demand of 226,279.

Finally, I will ensure that each dataset entry includes the full citation as noted above, and prepare the information for structured output as required.
