To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Enhance Information Propagation for Graph Neural Network by Heterogeneous Aggregations" by Dawei Leng et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often discusses the context and relevance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention that they validate their method on several graph classification benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved. However, I need to find specific names and details.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. They explicitly mention five datasets related to drug discovery:

1. **Antivirus7k**: This dataset contains 7,305 samples with a balanced class distribution (P/N ratio = 0.49 / 0.51). It consists of phenotypic records of antiviral bioactivity collected from a commercial database.

2. **CYP2C9V12k**: This dataset has 12,092 samples and a P/N ratio of 0.67 / 0.33. It involves CYP P450 genes, which are crucial for the metabolism of various compounds.

3. **Malaria16k**: This dataset includes 16,933 samples with a P/N ratio of 0.93 / 0.07. It is curated from public datasets of malaria sensitivity assays.

4. **Mtb18k**: This dataset contains 18,886 samples with a P/N ratio of 0.88 / 0.12, focusing on phenotypic records against Mycobacterium tuberculosis.

5. **Globalvirus76k**: The largest dataset with 76,247 samples and a P/N ratio of 0.57 / 0.43, it combines various records of antiviral bioactivity.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations related to these datasets. However, the paper does not provide specific citations for the datasets themselves, as they are derived from industry sources or previous studies.

For the **Antivirus7k** dataset, I will note that it is based on phenotypic records from a commercial database, but no specific citation is provided. The same applies to the other datasets, as they are derived from various sources mentioned in the text.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the names and descriptions of each dataset, while acknowledging that specific citations may not be available for all datasets.

In summary, I will create structured entries for each dataset, focusing on their names, descriptions, and any relevant details provided in the paper, while noting the lack of formal citations for these datasets.
