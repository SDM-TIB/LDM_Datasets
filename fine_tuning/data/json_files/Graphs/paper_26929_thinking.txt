To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Contrastive Self-Supervised Learning for Wireless Power Control" by Navid Naderializadeh, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the proposed method but does not mention specific datasets. Therefore, I will focus on the **introduction** and **proposed approach** sections for more detailed information.

In the **introduction**, the author discusses the challenges of deriving optimal solutions for resource management problems and mentions the use of labeled and unlabeled samples. However, no specific datasets are named here.

Next, I will examine the **proposed approach** section, particularly the parts where the author describes the training process and the generation of training samples. The author mentions that they have access to a set of training samples consisting of labeled samples (pairs of input channel matrices and corresponding power control decisions) and unlabeled samples (input channel matrices only). However, the paper does not provide specific names for any datasets.

I will also check the **experiments section** to see if any datasets are referenced in the context of evaluating the proposed method. The author discusses the generation of training channel matrices modeled as Rayleigh random variables, but again, no specific datasets are cited.

Finally, I will look at the **references section** to see if any datasets are indirectly referenced through the works cited. The references include various papers related to machine learning and wireless communications, but they do not specifically mention datasets used in this study.

Since the paper does not explicitly name any datasets or provide citations for them, I will conclude that there are no formal datasets extracted from this paper. However, I will note that the author generates synthetic training samples based on the described methodology, which may not correspond to publicly available datasets.

In summary, I will document the findings as follows:

- No specific datasets are mentioned in the paper.
- The training samples are generated synthetically based on the described channel matrix modeling.

Since there are no formal datasets to cite, I will not provide any citations. Instead, I will summarize the methodology used for generating the training samples, which is based on the principles outlined in the paper.
