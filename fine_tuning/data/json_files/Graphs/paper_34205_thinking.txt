To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Context-aware Video Anomaly Detection in Long-Term Datasets" by Zhengye Yang and Richard J. Radke, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their algorithm on both conventional benchmarks and a public webcam-based dataset they collected. This suggests that there are at least two datasets to look for.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section**, specifically section 4, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In section 4.1, they introduce the **WF Dataset**, which is a new dataset collected from a public webcam looking at a baseball stadium. The authors provide details about the dataset, including the number of videos, resolution, duration, and the metadata collected. This dataset is crucial for their context-aware video anomaly detection approach.

Additionally, I will look for mentions of other datasets in section 4.2, where the authors discuss benchmark datasets. They mention three widely used datasets: **UCSD Ped2**, **Avenue**, and **ShanghaiTech**. Each of these datasets is used to evaluate the performance of their proposed method.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper:

1. **WF Dataset**: The authors do not provide a formal citation for this dataset since it is newly collected. However, I will note the details provided in the paper:
   - The dataset consists of 2000 videos collected over three months, with metadata including time of day, day of week, and scheduled game times.

2. **UCSD Ped2 Dataset**: The citation for this dataset is:
   > Weixin Li, Vijay Mahadevan, and Nuno Vasconcelos. *Anomaly Detection and Localization in Crowded Scenes*. IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence (TPAMI), 36(1):18–32, 2014.

3. **Avenue Dataset**: The citation for this dataset is:
   > Cewu Lu, Jianping Shi, and Jiaya Jia. *Abnormal Event Detection at 150 FPS in MATLAB*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 2720–2727, 2013.

4. **ShanghaiTech Dataset**: The citation for this dataset is:
   > Wen Liu, Weixin Luo, Dongze Lian, and Shenghua Gao. *Future Frame Prediction for Anomaly Detection – A New Baseline*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 6536–6545, 2018.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for the benchmark datasets and the details for the newly collected WF dataset. This structured approach will help ensure that I accurately represent the datasets used in the research paper.
