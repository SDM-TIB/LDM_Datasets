To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Bilateral Personalized Dialogue Generation with Contrastive Learning" by Bin Li and Hanjun Deng, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and it may mention datasets used for evaluation or training.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically **Section IV (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, the authors mention the **PersonalDialog dataset**, which is crucial for their evaluation. They describe it as containing sparse personas of multi-party dialogues, which is relevant for their research on personalized dialogue generation.

I will also look for any additional details about the dataset, such as its size, structure, and specific attributes. The authors mention that the dataset consists of 410K dialogues, with 400K used for training and 10K for validation. They also specify that the dataset includes personalized profiles with attributes like "Gender," "Area," and "Individual interests."

After identifying the dataset, I will check the **References section** for the full citation of the dataset. The authors reference the PersonalDialog dataset as follows:

- For the **PersonalDialog dataset**, the citation is:
  > Zheng, Y., Chen, G., Huang, M., Liu, S., & Zhu, X. (2019). *Personalized dialogue generation with diversified traits*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1901.09672.

Now, I will compile the information about the dataset into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation as it is essential for proper attribution.

In summary, I will extract the following dataset information:
1. **Dataset Name**: PersonalDialog dataset
2. **Description**: A corpus containing sparse personas of multi-party dialogues, with personalized profiles including attributes like "Gender," "Area," and "Individual interests."
3. **Size**: 410K dialogues (400K for training, 10K for validation)
4. **Full Citation**: Zheng, Y., Chen, G., Huang, M., Liu, S., & Zhu, X. (2019). *Personalized dialogue generation with diversified traits*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1901.09672.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare it for output in the required format.
