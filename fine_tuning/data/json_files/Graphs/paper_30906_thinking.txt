To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Mitigating Negative Style Transfer in Hybrid Dialogue System" by Shimin Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors performed experiments on "three dialogue datasets," which indicates that there are specific datasets to look for. The introduction further elaborates on the nature of these datasets, hinting at a hybrid dialogue dataset and two task-oriented dialogue datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically the part where the authors discuss the datasets used. In this section, they explicitly name the datasets:

1. **FusedChat**: This dataset is described as a hybrid dialogue dataset that expands or rewrites conversations based on task-oriented dialogues, incorporating additional open-domain dialogue rounds.

2. **MultiWOZ 2.0**: This is a well-known task-oriented dialogue dataset collected via Wizard-of-Oz, containing a total of 8438 dialogues.

3. **MultiWOZ 2.1**: This is an updated version of MultiWOZ 2.0, which includes corrections to several buggy annotations.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and further exploration of the datasets.

The citations I will extract are:

- For **FusedChat**, the citation is:
  > Young, T., Xing, F. Z., Pandelea, V., Ni, J., & Cambria, E. (2021). Fusing task-oriented and open-domain dialogues in conversational agents. CoRR, abs/2109.04137.

- For **MultiWOZ 2.0**, the citation is:
  > Budzianowski, P., Wen, T., Tseng, B., Casanueva, I., Ultes, S., Ramadan, O., & Gasic, M. (2018). MultiWOZ - A Large-Scale Multi-Domain Wizard-of-Oz Dataset for Task-Oriented Dialogue Modelling. In Proceedings of the 2018 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, 5016–5026.

- For **MultiWOZ 2.1**, the citation is:
  > Eric, M., Goel, R., Paul, S., Sethi, A., Agarwal, S., Gao, S., Kumar, A., Goyal, A. K., Ku, P., & Hakkani-Tür, D. (2020). MultiWOZ 2.1: A Consolidated Multi-Domain Dialogue Dataset with State Corrections and State Tracking Baselines. In Proceedings of The 12th Language Resources and Evaluation Conference, 422–428.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This will ensure that all relevant details are captured accurately and comprehensively.
