To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Non-uniqueness phenomenon of object representation in modelling IT cortex by deep convolutional neural network (DCNN)" by Qiulei Dong et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a general overview, but I need to look for specific mentions of datasets in the context of experiments or analyses.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their research. In this paper, the authors mention using the **CIFAR-10** and **CIFAR-100** datasets for their experiments. I will look for detailed descriptions of these datasets, including their sizes and the specific configurations used in the experiments.

In the **experiments section**, the authors state that CIFAR-10 contains 60,000 images belonging to 10 categories, and CIFAR-100 contains 60,000 images belonging to 100 categories. They also mention that 5,000 images per category in CIFAR-10 and 500 images per category in CIFAR-100 were randomly selected for training, with the rest used for testing. This information is crucial for understanding how the datasets were utilized.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical Report, 2009.

- For **CIFAR-100**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical Report, 2009.

Both datasets are derived from the same technical report, which is important to note.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and that the full citations are included. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
