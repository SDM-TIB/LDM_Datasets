To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Goal-conditioned reinforcement learning for ultrasound navigation guidance" by Abdoul Aziz Amadou et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions a "large dataset of 789 patients" and a "testing dataset of 140 patients," which indicates that there are specific datasets used in the study. I will note these mentions for further investigation.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (section 3) closely, as it typically contains detailed information about the datasets used for training and testing. In this section, the authors state that they processed "929 patient CT datasets from the LIDC-IDRI dataset," which is crucial information. They also mention using the **FUMPE dataset** for interventional view navigation, which is another dataset to document.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. **LIDC-IDRI Dataset**: The citation for this dataset is:
   > Armato, S.G., McNitt-Gray, M.F. "The lung image database consortium (lidc) and image database resource initiative (idri): a completed reference database of lung nodules on ct scans." *Medical Physics*, 38(2), 915â€“931, 2011. https://doi.org/10.1118/1.3528204

2. **FUMPE Dataset**: The citation for this dataset is:
   > Masoudi, M., Pourreza, H.R., Saadatmand-Tarzjan, M., Eftekhari, N., Zargar, F.S., Rad, M.P. "A new dataset of computed-tomography angiography images for computer-aided detection of pulmonary embolism." *Scientific Data*, 5, 2018. https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.c.4107803.v1

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
