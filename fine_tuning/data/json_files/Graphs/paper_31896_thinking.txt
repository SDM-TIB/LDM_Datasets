To extract datasets from the research paper titled "When Search Meets Recommendation: Learning Disentangled Search Representation for Recommendation" by Zihua Si et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention the datasets used for experiments. In this case, the authors indicate that they conducted experiments on two datasets, which is a good starting point.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets in detail. In this paper, the authors mention two datasets: the **Kuaishou Dataset** and the **Amazon Dataset**. I will extract the relevant details about each dataset, including the number of users, items, queries, and actions.

1. **Kuaishou Dataset**: This dataset is constructed from behavior logs of 35,721 users who used both search and recommendation services on the Kuaishou app. It includes:
   - Users: 35,721
   - Items: 11,381,172
   - Queries: 822,832
   - Actions (Search): 398,924
   - Actions (Recommendation): 934,664

2. **Amazon Dataset**: This dataset is based on the "Kindle Store" subset of the Amazon dataset, which includes:
   - Users: 68,223
   - Items: 61,934
   - Queries: 989,618
   - Actions (Search): 4,298
   - Actions (Recommendation): Not explicitly mentioned, but it is implied that it includes user interactions.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The Kuaishou dataset is derived from user behavior logs, and while it may not have a formal citation, it is important to note its source. The Amazon dataset is referenced as follows:

- For the Amazon Dataset, the citation is:
  > Ruining He and Julian McAuley. *Ups and Downs: Modeling the Visual Evolution of Fashion Trends with One-Class Collaborative Filtering*. In Proceedings of the 25th International Conference on World Wide Web (WWW), pages 507â€“517, 2016. https://doi.org/10.1145/2872427.2883037

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
