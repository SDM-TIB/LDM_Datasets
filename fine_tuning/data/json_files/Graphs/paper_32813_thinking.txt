To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Rayleigh Quotient Graph Neural Networks for Graph-Level Anomaly Detection" by Xiangyu Dong et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on **10 real-world datasets**, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, they explicitly list the datasets as follows:

1. **MCF-7**: A breast cancer cell line used for evaluating the model's performance.
2. **MOLT-4**: A leukemia cell line included in the experiments.
3. **PC-3**: A prostate cancer cell line.
4. **SW-620**: A colon cancer cell line.
5. **NCI-H23**: A non-small cell lung cancer cell line.
6. **OVCAR-8**: An ovarian cancer cell line.
7. **P388**: A central nervous system cancer cell line.
8. **SF-295**: A melanoma cell line.
9. **SN12C**: Another cancer cell line used in the study.
10. **UACC257**: A melanoma cell line.

The authors also mention that these datasets are obtained from the **TUDataset**, which is a collection of benchmark datasets for learning with graphs.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The relevant citation for the TUDataset is:

- **TUDataset**: 
  > Christopher Morris, Nils M. Kriege, Franka Bause, Kristian Kersting, Petra Mutzel, and Marion Neumann. *TUDataset: A collection of benchmark datasets for learning with graphs*. In ICML Workshop GRL+, 2020.

With this information, I can summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **MCF-7**: Breast cancer cell line.
2. **MOLT-4**: Leukemia cell line.
3. **PC-3**: Prostate cancer cell line.
4. **SW-620**: Colon cancer cell line.
5. **NCI-H23**: Non-small cell lung cancer cell line.
6. **OVCAR-8**: Ovarian cancer cell line.
7. **P388**: Central nervous system cancer cell line.
8. **SF-295**: Melanoma cell line.
9. **SN12C**: Cancer cell line.
10. **UACC257**: Melanoma cell line.

All datasets are sourced from the TUDataset, which is cited above.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset and its citation, ensuring that the extraction is thorough and accurate.
