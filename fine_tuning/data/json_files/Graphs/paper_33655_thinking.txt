To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Rank Supervised Contrastive Learning for Time Series Classification" by Qianying Ren et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted empirical studies on **128 UCR datasets** and **30 UEA datasets**, indicating that these datasets are central to their research.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** within the paper, which is typically where authors describe the datasets used in their experiments. In this case, the relevant information is found in **section 4.1 (Datasets)**. Here, the authors explicitly mention the two main sources of datasets they utilized:

1. **UCR Archive**: This archive contains **128 univariate time series datasets**. The authors reference the original paper that describes this archive.
   
2. **UEA Archive**: This archive consists of **30 multivariate time series datasets**. Similar to the UCR datasets, the authors also cite the original paper for this archive.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **UCR Archive**, the citation is:
  > Hoang Anh Dau, Anthony Bagnall, Kaveh Kamgar, Chin-Chia Michael Yeh, Yan Zhu, Shaghayegh Gharghabi, Chotirat Ann Ratanamahatana, and Eamonn J. Keogh. *The UCR Time Series Archive*. CoRR, abs/1810.07758, 2018.

- For the **UEA Archive**, the citation is:
  > Anthony J. Bagnall, Hoang Anh Dau, Jason Lines, Michael Flynn, James Large, Aaron Bostrom, Paul Southam, and Eamonn J. Keogh. *The UEA Multivariate Time Series Classification Archive*. CoRR, abs/1811.00075, 2018.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will summarize the findings:

1. **UCR Archive**: Contains 128 univariate time series datasets.
   - Citation: Hoang Anh Dau et al. (2018). *The UCR Time Series Archive*. CoRR, abs/1810.07758.

2. **UEA Archive**: Contains 30 multivariate time series datasets.
   - Citation: Anthony J. Bagnall et al. (2018). *The UEA Multivariate Time Series Classification Archive*. CoRR, abs/1811.00075.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
