To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Skeleton-based Human Action Recognition via Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)" by Ayman Ali et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and dataset sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors achieved a score of 95% on the **NTU-60 dataset**, indicating that this dataset is likely important for their research.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **introduction**. The introduction discusses the rise of human action recognition datasets but does not explicitly name any additional datasets beyond the NTU-60 dataset.

I will then focus on the **dataset section** (VIII. DATASET) to find detailed descriptions. Here, the authors provide a comprehensive overview of the **NTU RGB+D dataset** and the **NTU-60 dataset**:

1. **NTU RGB+D Dataset**: This dataset is described as a substantial multi-view action dataset with 56,000 samples from 40 individuals and 60 action classes, which are classified into three categories: daily activities, health-related actions, and interactions. It was collected using a Microsoft Kinect device, providing RGB, depth, skeleton, and infrared modalities.

2. **NTU-60 Dataset**: This dataset is an extension of the NTU RGB+D dataset, featuring 106 subjects performing 120 action classes and 114,500 video samples. It utilizes the same capturing system and modalities as the original dataset.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **NTU RGB+D dataset**, the citation is:
  > Amir Shahroudy, Jun Liu, Tian-Tsong Ng, and Gang Wang. *NTU RGB+D: A large scale dataset for 3D human activity analysis*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 1010–1019, 2016.

- For the **NTU-60 dataset**, the citation is:
  > Jun Liu, Amir Shahroudy, Mauricio Perez, Gang Wang, Ling-Yu Duan, and Alex C. Kot. *NTU RGB+D 120: A large-scale benchmark for 3D human activity understanding*. IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 42(10):2684–2701, 2019.

Now that I have gathered all necessary information about the datasets, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
