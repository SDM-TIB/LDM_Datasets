To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Language-aware Domain Generalization Network for Cross-Scene Hyperspectral Image Classification" by Yuxiang Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that extensive experiments were conducted on three datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section IV (Experimental Results and Discussion)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they refer to three datasets:

1. **Houston Dataset**: This dataset includes both the Houston 2013 and Houston 2018 scenes, which were captured by different sensors over the same area in different years. The authors provide details about the number of pixels, spectral bands, and classes.

2. **Pavia Dataset**: This dataset consists of the University of Pavia and Pavia Center scenes, with specific information about the number of pixels and spectral bands for each scene.

3. **GID Dataset**: The authors describe the GID dataset, which includes multispectral images taken at different times in various regions of China, specifying the source and target domains.

In the **experimental results section**, the authors provide detailed descriptions of each dataset, including the number of samples per class, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's structure.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For the **Houston Dataset**, the citation is:
  > C. Debes et al., "Hyperspectral and LiDAR data fusion: Outcome of the 2013 GRSS data fusion contest," *IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations & Remote Sensing*, vol. 7, no. 6, pp. 2405–2418, 2014.

- For the **Pavia Dataset**, the citation is:
  > B. Le Saux et al., "2018 IEEE GRSS data fusion contest: Multimodal land use classification," *IEEE Geoscience & Remote Sensing Magazine*, vol. 6, no. 1, pp. 52–54, 2018.

- For the **GID Dataset**, the citation is:
  > X.-Y. Tong et al., "Land-cover classification with high-resolution remote sensing images using transferable deep models," *Remote Sensing of Environment*, vol. 237, p. 111322, 2020.

After gathering all this information, I will summarize the datasets, ensuring to include their names, descriptions, and full citations. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
