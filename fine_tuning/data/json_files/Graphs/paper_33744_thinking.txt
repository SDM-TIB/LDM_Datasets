To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CORE-GD: A Hierarchical Framework for Scalable Graph Visualization with GNNs" by Florian GrÃ¶tschla et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and empirical evaluation sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the empirical evaluation demonstrates the framework's performance on various datasets, which indicates that specific datasets will be discussed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **empirical evaluation section** (Section 4) where the authors detail their experiments. Here, they explicitly mention several datasets used for evaluation:

1. **Rome Dataset**: This dataset is described as a common benchmark in the Graph Drawing community, consisting of graphs collected at the University of Rome. It is used for stress optimization in graph drawing.

2. **ZINC Dataset**: This dataset contains molecular graphs from the ZINC database of compounds, which are used for virtual screening.

3. **MNIST Dataset**: The authors mention that this dataset is generated from the classical MNIST dataset by extracting superpixels, which are small regions of homogeneous intensity in images.

4. **CIFAR10 Dataset**: Similar to MNIST, this dataset is derived from the CIFAR10 dataset, also using superpixel extraction.

5. **PATTERN Dataset**: This dataset consists of synthetic graphs generated with the Stochastic Block Model.

6. **CLUSTER Dataset**: Another synthetic dataset generated using the Stochastic Block Model.

7. **Suitesparse Graphs**: The authors mention using a subset of graphs from the suitesparse matrix collection, which includes various real-world instances.

8. **Delaunay Graphs**: These are generated from random 2D point clouds, resulting in planar graphs.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
