To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "BS-GAT: Behavior Similarity Based Graph Attention Network for Network Intrusion Detection" by Yalu Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental evaluation sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that experiments were conducted based on the latest datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experimental Evaluation)**, particularly **subsection 4.1 (Data Sets)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention two datasets:

1. **NF-BoT-IoT-v2**: This dataset was released in 2021 and contains 5 classes with 43 features and a total of 37,763,497 data points. The benign ratio varies from 0.0 to 10.0.

2. **NF-ToN-IoT-v2**: Released in 2021 as well, this dataset has 10 classes, 43 features, and a total of 16,940,496 data points, with a benign ratio ranging from 3.6 to 6.4.

The authors also mention that these datasets are improved versions of the original NF-BoT-IoT and NF-ToN-IoT datasets, which were released in 2020.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The relevant citations are:

- For **NF-BoT-IoT**:
  > Koroniotis, Nickolaos, Nour Moustafa, Elena Sitnikova, and Benjamin Turnbull. "Towards the development of realistic botnet dataset in the internet of things for network forensic analytics: Bot-iot dataset." *Future Generation Computer Systems*, vol. 100, 2019, pp. 779-796.

- For **NF-ToN-IoT**:
  > Moustafa, Nour. "A new distributed architecture for evaluating AI-based security systems at the edge: Network TON_IoT datasets." *Sustainable Cities and Society*, 2021, Article 102994.

Having gathered the necessary information, I will now compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations as required.
