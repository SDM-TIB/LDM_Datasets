To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Semantic Contrastive Bootstrapping for Single-positive Multi-label Recognition" by Cheng Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections for any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on "four public multi-label image recognition benchmarks," which indicates that datasets are involved.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section** (Section 5). Here, the authors explicitly state that they conducted experiments on four representative benchmarks: 

1. **PASCAL VOC 2007**: This dataset is widely used for object detection and segmentation tasks, containing 20 categories with images that have multiple labels.
2. **PASCAL VOC 2012**: An extension of the VOC 2007 dataset, it also contains 20 categories and is used for similar tasks.
3. **Microsoft COCO 2014**: This dataset is known for its complexity and contains 80 categories, focusing on object recognition in context.
4. **CUB-200-2011**: This dataset is used for fine-grained visual classification and contains 312 binary attributes per image.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **PASCAL VOC 2007**, the citation is:
  > Everingham M, Van Gool L, Williams CKI, Winn J, Zisserman A. *The PASCAL Visual Object Classes Challenge 2007 (VOC2007) Results*. http://www.pascal-network.org/challenges/VOC/voc2007/workshop/index.html

- For **PASCAL VOC 2012**, the citation is:
  > Everingham M, Van Gool L, Williams CKI, Winn J, Zisserman A. *The PASCAL Visual Object Classes Challenge 2012 (VOC2012) Results*. http://www.pascal-network.org/challenges/VOC/voc2012/workshop/index.html

- For **Microsoft COCO 2014**, the citation is:
  > Lin TY, Maire M, Belongie S, Hays J, Perona P, Ramanan D, Dollar P, Zitnick CL. *Microsoft COCO: Common objects in context*. In: European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), 2014.

- For **CUB-200-2011**, the citation is:
  > Wah C, Branson S, Welinder P, Perona P, Belongie S. *The Caltech-UCSD Birds-200-2011 Dataset*. Tech. Rep. CNS-TR-2011-001, California Institute of Technology.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, which is essential for reproducibility and further research.
