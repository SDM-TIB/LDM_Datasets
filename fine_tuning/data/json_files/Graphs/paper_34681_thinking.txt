To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Graph Neural Network Enhanced Retrieval for Question Answering of LLMs" by Zijian Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions "extensive experiments on benchmark datasets," which indicates that datasets are likely discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they mention four different QA datasets:

1. **MuSiQue**: A multi-hop question answering dataset that involves reasoning across multiple documents. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Trivedi, H., Balasubramanian, N., Khot, T., & Sabharwal, A. (2022). MuSiQue: Multihop questions via single-hop question composition. *Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics*, 10, 539-554.

2. **IIRC**: A dataset of incomplete information reading comprehension questions. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Ferguson, J., Gardner, M., Hajishirzi, H., Khot, T., & Dasigi, P. (2020). IIRC: A dataset of incomplete information reading comprehension questions. *arXiv preprint arXiv:2011.07127*.

3. **2WikiMQA**: A dataset designed for multi-hop question answering, constructed for comprehensive evaluation of reasoning steps. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Ho, X., Nguyen, A.-K. D., Sugawara, S., & Aizawa, A. (2020). Constructing a multi-hop QA dataset for comprehensive evaluation of reasoning steps. *arXiv preprint arXiv:2011.01060*.

4. **Quality**: A single-hop multi-choice QA dataset. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Pang, R. Y., Parrish, A., Joshi, N., Nangia, N., Phang, J., Chen, A., Padmakumar, V., Ma, J., Thompson, H., & He, H. (2021). Quality: Question answering with long input texts, yes! *arXiv preprint arXiv:2112.08608*.

After identifying these datasets, I will ensure to check the **References section** of the paper to confirm the full citations for each dataset, as accuracy in citation is crucial.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including their names and citations, into a structured format for easy reference and further processing.
