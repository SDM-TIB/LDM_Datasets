To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-Grained Contrast for Data-Efficient Unsupervised Representation Learning" by Chengchao Shen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on various downstream tasks, which suggests that multiple datasets are likely involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for training and evaluation. In this section, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names and any relevant details about their characteristics.

Upon reviewing the experiments section, I find that the authors mention using the following datasets:

1. **MS COCO2017**: This dataset is used for object detection, instance segmentation, and keypoint detection tasks. It is a well-known dataset in the computer vision community.

2. **ADE20K**: This dataset is utilized for scene parsing tasks. It is another popular dataset for semantic segmentation.

3. **PASCAL VOC07+12**: This dataset is mentioned for semantic segmentation tasks. It is a classic dataset used in various vision tasks.

4. **Cityscapes**: This dataset is used for evaluating the model on urban scene understanding tasks, specifically for object detection and instance segmentation.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each of these datasets:

- For **MS COCO2017**, the citation is:

- For **Cityscapes**, the citation is:

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes the full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details regarding the datasets used in the research.
