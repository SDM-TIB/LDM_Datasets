To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Reinforcement Learning Based Graph-to-Sequence Model for Natural Question Generation" by Yu Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract highlights that the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art scores on the **SQuAD benchmark**, which suggests that this dataset is likely used in their experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** to confirm the datasets used. In section 3.1, the authors state that they evaluate their model against state-of-the-art methods on the **SQuAD dataset**. They mention that SQuAD contains over 100K questions posed by crowd workers on 536 Wikipedia articles, which provides a clear description of the dataset.

I will also check the **data and metrics section** for more details about the SQuAD dataset. The authors specify that they use two data splits for their experiments, referred to as **data split-1** and **data split-2**, which contain different numbers of training, development, and test examples.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citation for the SQuAD dataset. The citation for the SQuAD dataset is as follows:
> Pranav Rajpurkar, Jian Zhang, Konstantin Lopyrev, and Percy Liang. *SQuAD: 100,000+ Questions for Machine Comprehension of Text*. In arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.05250, 2016.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry for the SQuAD dataset, ensuring to include the full citation as required.

In summary, the steps I followed are:
1. Read the abstract and introduction to identify potential datasets.
2. Confirm the dataset in the experiments section.
3. Gather details about the dataset from the data and metrics section.
4. Retrieve the full citation from the references.

Now, I will prepare the dataset entry for the SQuAD dataset based on the information collected.
