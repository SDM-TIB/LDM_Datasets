To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Self-Supervised Video Representation Learning by Video Incoherence Detection" by Haozhi Cao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the proposed method is evaluated through extensive experiments on action recognition and video retrieval using various datasets. This indicates that datasets are likely discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In the provided text, the authors explicitly mention three datasets used for evaluation: **UCF101**, **HMDB51**, and **Kinetics-400**. I will note down the details provided for each dataset.

1. **UCF101**: This dataset is described as containing 13,320 videos across 101 action categories. It is a widely used benchmark for action recognition tasks.

2. **HMDB51**: This dataset includes approximately 7,000 videos with 51 action classes. It is noted as being smaller yet more challenging compared to UCF101.

3. **Kinetics-400**: This is a large dataset comprising about 304,000 videos with 400 action classes, collected from YouTube. It is mentioned that the training split of Kinetics-400 is utilized for self-supervised pre-training.

After identifying these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

- For **UCF101**, the citation is:

- For **HMDB51**, the citation is:
  > Kuehne, H., Jhuang, H., Garrote, E., Poggio, T., & Serre, T. (2011). *HMDB51: A Large Video Database for Human Motion Recognition*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision, 2556â€“2563.

- For **Kinetics-400**, the citation is:
  > Kay, W., Carreira, J., Simonyan, K., Zhang, B., Hillier, C., Vijayanarasimhan, S., Viola, F., Green, T., Back, T., Natsev, P., et al. (2017). *The kinetics human action video dataset*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1705.06950.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
