To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Relation Classification with Entity Type Restriction" by Shengfei Lyu and Huanhuan Chen, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the proposed paradigm, RECENT, is evaluated on the **TACRED dataset**, which indicates that this dataset is crucial for understanding the experiments conducted.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experiments)**, where the authors provide details about the dataset used for evaluation. In this section, they explicitly mention that the proposed paradigm RECENT is evaluated on **TACRED**, which contains 41 semantic relations and a special "no relation" category over 106,264 sentences. This section provides essential details about the dataset's structure and its significance in the experiments.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the TACRED dataset. The authors reference the dataset as follows:

- **TACRED Dataset**:
  > Zhang, Y., Qi, P., & Manning, C. D. (2017). Graph convolution over pruned dependency trees improves relation extraction. In Proceedings of the 2018 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (pp. 2205â€“2215). Association for Computational Linguistics.

Since TACRED is the only dataset mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information about it, including its description and citation.

Now, I will prepare the dataset entry based on the information gathered, ensuring that the full citation is included for proper attribution. This structured approach will help ensure that I accurately capture the dataset's details and its significance in the context of the research presented in the paper.
