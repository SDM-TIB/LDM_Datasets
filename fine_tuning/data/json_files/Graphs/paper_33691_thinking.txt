To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Against Spurious Sparksâ€”Dovelating Inflated AI Claims" by Patrick Altmeyer et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a general overview, but I need to look for specific references to datasets in the body of the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments and results sections**. In these sections, the authors often describe the datasets used for their experiments. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, descriptions, and any relevant details about their structure or purpose.

In the paper, I notice that the authors refer to two datasets:

1. **world_place.csv**: This dataset is used in the context of geographical coordinates and is mentioned in the section discussing the experiments related to LLMs and world models. It maps locations to their latitude and longitude, which is crucial for the experiments described.

2. **Trillion Dollar Words**: This dataset is referenced in the context of economic sentiment prediction. It contains curated sentences from central bankers and is used to train models for classifying economic sentiment.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **world_place.csv**, the dataset is not attributed to a specific citation in the references, but it is mentioned in the context of the work by Gurnee and Tegmark (2023a). Therefore, I will cite it as follows:
  > Gurnee, W., & Tegmark, M. (2023). Language Models Represent Space and Time. arXiv preprint arXiv:2310.02207v2.

- For the **Trillion Dollar Words dataset**, the citation is:
  > Shah, A., Paturi, S., & Chava, S. (2023). Trillion Dollar Words: A New Financial Dataset, Task & Market Analysis. arXiv preprint arXiv:2310.02207v1.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
