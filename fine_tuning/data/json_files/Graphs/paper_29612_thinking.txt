To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Keywords and Instances: A Hierarchical Contrastive Learning Framework Unifying Hybrid Granularities for Text Generation" by Mingzhe Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **experiments section (Section 4)**, the authors explicitly mention three datasets used for their experiments: **QQP**, **Douban**, and **RocStories**. I will take note of the details provided for each dataset, including their purpose and characteristics.

1. **QQP Dataset**: This dataset is used for paraphrasing tasks and consists of question pairs from the Quora platform. The authors mention that they adapted it for contrastive learning, retaining 44,949 samples split into training, validation, and test sets.

2. **Douban Dataset**: This dataset is utilized for dialogue generation and contains Chinese daily conversations collected from the Douban social network. The authors specify that it includes 218,039 training pairs, along with validation and test sets.

3. **RocStories Dataset**: This dataset is used for storytelling tasks and comprises 98,163 high-quality stories that capture commonsense relations of daily events.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

- For the **QQP dataset**, the citation is:
  > Iyer, S., Dandekar, N., & Csernai, K. (2017). First quora dataset release: Question pairs.

- For the **Douban dataset**, the citation is:
  > Cai, H., Chen, H., Song, Y., Ding, Z., Bao, Y., Yan, W., & Zhao, X. (2020). Group-wise contrastive learning for neural dialogue generation. In Proceedings of the 2020 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing: Findings, EMNLP 2020, pages 793–802.

- For the **RocStories dataset**, the citation is:
  > Mostafazadeh, N., Chambers, N., He, X., Parikh, D., Batra, D., Vanderwende, L., Kohli, P., & Allen, J. (2016). A corpus and cloze evaluation for deeper understanding of commonsense stories. In NAACL 2016, pages 839–849.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture the necessary details for each dataset mentioned in the paper.
