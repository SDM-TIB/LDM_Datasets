To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Semi-supervised 3D Object Detection with Proficient Teachers" by Junbo Yin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant details, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the effectiveness of the proposed model is verified on both the **ONCE** and **Waymo** datasets, indicating that these are the primary datasets used in the research.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** in the paper, which is typically where authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets they used. In this case, I find that **section 4.1** is dedicated to datasets, where the authors provide specific details about both the ONCE and Waymo datasets.

1. **ONCE Dataset**: The ONCE dataset is described as a large-scale autonomous driving dataset containing 1 million LiDAR point cloud samples, with only 15,000 samples annotated. The dataset includes five types of annotated objects: "Car," "Bus," "Truck," "Pedestrian," and "Cyclist." The authors also mention specific splits for training, validation, and testing.

2. **Waymo Open Dataset**: The Waymo dataset is described as containing 798 sequences (158,361 frames) for training and 202 sequences (40,077 frames) for validation. The authors explain how they tailored the dataset for semi-supervised learning by dividing the training sequences into labeled and unlabeled splits.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **ONCE Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Mao, J., Niu, M., Jiang, C., Liang, H., Chen, J., Liang, X., Li, Y., Ye, C., Zhang, W., Li, Z., et al. *One million scenes for autonomous driving: ONCE dataset*. In: NeurIPS Datasets and Benchmarks, 2021.

- For the **Waymo Open Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Sun, P., Kretzschmar, H., Dotiwalla, X., Chouard, A., Patnaik, V., Tsui, P., Guo, J., Zhou, Y., Chai, Y., Caine, B., et al. *Scalability in perception for autonomous driving: Waymo Open Dataset*. In: CVPR, 2020.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or processing. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their full citations as required.
