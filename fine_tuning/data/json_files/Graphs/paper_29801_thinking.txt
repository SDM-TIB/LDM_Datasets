To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Language Models as Knowledge Embeddings" by Xintao Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and while it may not explicitly list datasets, it may hint at their use in experiments.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments and Analyses)**, as this section typically contains detailed information about the datasets used in the experiments. Here, the authors mention four datasets: **FB13, FB15k-237, UMLS, and WN18RR**. I will take note of the context in which these datasets are used, including their purpose (link prediction and triple classification) and any specific characteristics mentioned.

In **Table 3**, the authors provide statistics for each dataset, including the number of entities, relations, and the number of training, development, and test samples. This information is crucial for understanding the datasets' scope and scale.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are essential for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. The relevant citations from the paper are:

1. **FB13**:
   > Socher, R., Chen, D., Manning, C. D., & Ng, A. Y. (2013). Reasoning with neural tensor networks for knowledge base completion. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS).

2. **FB15k-237**:
   > Toutanova, K. (2015). Observed versus latent features for knowledge base and text inference. ACL-IJCNLP 2015, page 57.

3. **UMLS**:
   > Dettmers, T., Minervini, P., Stenetorp, P., & Riedel, S. (2018). Convolutional 2D knowledge graph embeddings. In Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence.

4. **WN18RR**:
   > Dettmers, T., Minervini, P., Stenetorp, P., & Riedel, S. (2018). Convolutional 2D knowledge graph embeddings. In Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence.

With this information, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **FB13**: A dataset derived from Freebase, used for triple classification.
2. **FB15k-237**: A subset of FB15k, used for link prediction, with abundant inverse relations removed.
3. **UMLS**: A medical ontology describing relations between medical concepts, used for triple classification.
4. **WN18RR**: A dataset derived from WordNet, used for link prediction.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant information regarding the datasets used in the research paper.
