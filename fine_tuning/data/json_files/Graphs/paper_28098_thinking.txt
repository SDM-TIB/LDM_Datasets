To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An Angle Independent Depth Aware Fusion Beamforming Approach for Ultrafast Ultrasound Flow Imaging" by Madhavanunni A N and Mahesh Raveendranatha Panicker, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, results, and conclusion sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the proposed method but does not explicitly mention datasets. Therefore, I will focus on the introduction and subsequent sections.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss various techniques related to vector flow imaging but do not specify any datasets. I will continue to the **methods section** where they describe their proposed fusion beamforming approach. Here, they mention using a flow phantom for simulation studies, which indicates that there may be a dataset associated with this phantom.

Next, I will look at the **results section**. The authors describe simulation studies and in-vivo experiments. They mention using a flow phantom with multiple parabolic flows, which suggests that there is a dataset generated from these simulations. However, they do not provide a specific name for this dataset.

In the **experimental investigation**, they mention acquiring in-vivo carotid data using the Verasonics Vantage research ultrasound system. This indicates that there is a dataset associated with the in-vivo experiments, which is crucial for my extraction.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. However, the paper does not provide specific citations for the datasets used in the simulation or in-vivo studies. The authors reference various techniques and previous works, but they do not cite a specific dataset for the flow phantom or the in-vivo carotid data.

Since the paper lacks explicit dataset names and citations, I will summarize the datasets based on the information provided:

1. **Flow Phantom Dataset**: This dataset is generated from simulations using the Field II program in MATLAB, but no specific citation is provided.

2. **In-vivo Carotid Dataset**: This dataset is acquired using the Verasonics Vantage research ultrasound system, but again, no specific citation is provided.

Given the lack of explicit dataset names and citations in the paper, I will note that while the authors describe the datasets used, they do not provide formal citations for them. This is a critical point to highlight, as proper citation is essential for dataset attribution.

In conclusion, I will compile the information regarding the datasets, noting the absence of formal citations, and prepare it for structured output.
