To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Contrastive Learning Approach to Mitigate Bias in Speech Models" by Alkis Koudounas et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their approach on two spoken language understanding datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental setup section** (Section 3), where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they state that they evaluated their approach on two public intent classification datasets: **FSC** and **ITALIC**. I will take note of the details provided for each dataset.

1. **FSC Dataset**: The authors describe it as containing 30,043 utterances annotated with action, object, and location defining intents. This dataset is crucial for their experiments, and I will need to find its full citation.

2. **ITALIC Dataset**: This dataset is mentioned as containing 16,521 samples with action and scenario denoting intents. Like the FSC dataset, it is also essential for their experiments, and I will look for its full citation as well.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the complete citations for both datasets:

- For the **FSC Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Lugosch, L., Ravanelli, M., Ignoto, P., Tomar, V. S., & Bengio, Y. (2019). Speech model pre-training for end-to-end spoken language understanding. In Proceedings of the INTERSPEECH (pp. 1-5).

- For the **ITALIC Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Koudounas, A., La Quatra, M., Vaiani, L., Colomba, L., Attanasio, G., Pastor, E., Cagliero, L., & Baralis, E. (2023). ITALIC: An Italian Intent Classification Dataset. In Proceedings of the INTERSPEECH (pp. 2153-2157).

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes its full citation. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, which is essential for reproducibility and further research in the field.
