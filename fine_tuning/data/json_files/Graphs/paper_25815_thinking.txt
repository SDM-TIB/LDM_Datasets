To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Graph Attention Networks" by Petar Veličković et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and evaluation sections** of the paper to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the contributions and results, which may include references to datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **evaluation section** (Section 3), where the authors summarize their experimental setup and results. This section typically contains detailed information about the datasets used, including their characteristics and how they were utilized in the experiments.

In **subsection 3.1 (Datasets)**, the authors describe the datasets used for both transductive and inductive learning tasks. They mention:

1. **Cora Dataset**: A citation network with 2,708 nodes, 5,429 edges, 1,433 features per node, and 7 classes.
2. **Citeseer Dataset**: Another citation network with 3,327 nodes, 4,732 edges, 3,703 features per node, and 6 classes.
3. **Pubmed Dataset**: A larger citation network with 19,717 nodes, 44,338 edges, 500 features per node, and 3 classes.
4. **PPI Dataset**: A protein-protein interaction dataset consisting of 24 graphs, with 56,944 nodes, 818,716 edges, and 121 multilabel classes.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- **Cora Dataset**: 
  > Sen, P., Namata, G., Bilgic, M., Getoor, L., Galligher, J., & Eliassi-Rad, T. (2008). Collective classification in network data. *AI Magazine*, 29(3), 93.

- **Citeseer Dataset**: 
  > Sen, P., Namata, G., Bilgic, M., Getoor, L., Galligher, J., & Eliassi-Rad, T. (2008). Collective classification in network data. *AI Magazine*, 29(3), 93.

- **Pubmed Dataset**: 
  > Sen, P., Namata, G., Bilgic, M., Getoor, L., Galligher, J., & Eliassi-Rad, T. (2008). Collective classification in network data. *AI Magazine*, 29(3), 93.

- **PPI Dataset**: 
  > Zitnik, M., & Leskovec, J. (2017). Predicting multicellular function through multi-layer tissue networks. *Bioinformatics*, 33(14), i190–i198.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will help me accurately extract and present the datasets used in the research paper.
