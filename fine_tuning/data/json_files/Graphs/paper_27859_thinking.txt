To extract datasets from the research paper titled "dFDA-VeD: A Dynamic Future Demand Aware Vehicle Dispatching System" by Yang Guo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections for any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their system on a "real-world dataset," which suggests that a specific dataset is used, but does not provide its name. The introduction may provide further context or details about the dataset.

Next, I will look into **section 5 (Experiments and Results)**, where the authors discuss the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they specifically mention the "trip records dataset" from New York City Taxi Records in January 2011, which is crucial for my extraction.

The paper states that the dataset includes trips where both the pickup and dropoff locations are within Manhattan Island. This is an important detail that I need to capture.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The paper provides a link to the dataset, which is essential for proper citation. The citation for the dataset is as follows:

- **Trip Records Dataset**: 
  > New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission. *TLC Trip Record Data*. Available at: https://www1.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the findings:

1. **Trip Records Dataset**: This dataset consists of trip records from New York City Taxi Records for January 2011, specifically focusing on trips within Manhattan Island.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and future reference. This includes the dataset name, description, and full citation, ensuring that all necessary details are included for proper attribution.
