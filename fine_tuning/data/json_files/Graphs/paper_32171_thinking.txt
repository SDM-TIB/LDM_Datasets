To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Spatial Heterophily Aware Graph Neural Networks" by Congxi Xiao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that extensive experiments were conducted on three real-world urban datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, they provide a summary table (Table 1) that lists the datasets along with their characteristics, such as the number of nodes, edges, and labeled instances. This table is crucial as it provides a concise overview of the datasets.

The paper identifies three datasets used in their experiments:

1. **Shenzhen Dataset**: This dataset is used for the Commercial Activeness Prediction (CAP) task. It consists of 82,510 nodes and 9,486,879 edges, with 9,121 labeled instances.

2. **Manhattan Dataset**: This dataset is utilized for the Crime Prediction (CP) task. It contains 180 nodes and 3,780 edges, with 180 labeled instances.

3. **Los Angeles Dataset**: This dataset is employed for the Dangerous Road Section Detection (DRSD) task. It has 253,985 nodes and 1,365,289 edges, with 15,274 labeled instances.

After identifying the datasets, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The authors typically cite the original sources of the datasets they used, which is essential for proper attribution.

The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **Shenzhen Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Xiao, C., Zhou, J., Huang, J., Xu, T., & Xiong, H. (2023). Spatial Heterophily Aware Graph Neural Networks. In Proceedings of the 29th ACM SIGKDD Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD '23), August 6â€“10, 2023, Long Beach, CA, USA. ACM, New York, NY, USA, 12 pages. https://doi.org/10.1145/3580305.3599510

- For the **Manhattan Dataset**, the citation is:
  > NYC Open Data. (2023). Crime data for Manhattan. Retrieved from https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/

- For the **Los Angeles Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Kaggle. (2021). Traffic accident records in Los Angeles. Retrieved from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sobhanmoosavi/us-accidents

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their sources as required.
