To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Reducing Annotation Need in Self-Explanatory Models for Lung Nodule Diagnosis" by Jiahao Lu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the use of the **LIDC dataset**, which is a strong indication that this dataset is significant for the research. I will note this down for further exploration.

Next, I will look into the **methodology** and **experiments** sections, specifically focusing on any sections that discuss datasets. In the introduction, the authors state that their experiments were conducted on the **LIDC dataset**, which is confirmed in the experimental results section. This dataset is crucial for understanding the context of their findings.

In the **experimental results** section, the authors describe their data preprocessing steps and mention the **LIDC dataset** again, detailing how they processed the scans and the criteria for including nodules. This reinforces the importance of the dataset in their study.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the **LIDC dataset**. The citation provided in the references is:

- **LIDC dataset**: 
  > Armato, S.G., McLennan, G., Bidaut, L., McNitt-Gray, M.F., et al. "The Lung Image Database Consortium (LIDC) and Image Database Resource Initiative (IDRI): A Completed Reference Database of Lung Nodules on CT Scans: The LIDC/IDRI thoracic CT database of lung nodules." *Medical Physics* 38(2), 915â€“931 (Jan 2011). https://doi.org/10.1118/1.3528204

Since the paper primarily focuses on the **LIDC dataset**, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity.

In summary, I have identified the following dataset from the paper:

1. **LIDC dataset**: A comprehensive dataset used for lung nodule diagnosis, which includes annotated CT scans of lung nodules.

Now, I will prepare to format this information according to the required structure for downstream processing.
