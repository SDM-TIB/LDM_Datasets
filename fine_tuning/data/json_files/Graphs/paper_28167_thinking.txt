To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Group-based Distinctive Image Captioning with Memory Attention" by Jiuniu Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will look for any mentions of datasets or data sources used in the study. 

In the **introduction**, I will pay attention to any references to datasets that the authors might have used to validate their model. The introduction often sets the stage for the research and may include key datasets that are central to the experiments.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** closely, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for training and testing their models. I will look for specific names of datasets, their characteristics, and any relevant details about how they were utilized in the experiments.

In this paper, the authors mention using the **MSCOCO dataset** for their experiments. I will note the details provided about this dataset, including its size and the nature of the annotations.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

For the **MSCOCO dataset**, the citation is:
> Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, Serge Belongie, et al. *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. In European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), 2014.

Finally, I will compile the information about the datasets into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citations as required. This will allow for easy reference and verification of the datasets used in the research.
