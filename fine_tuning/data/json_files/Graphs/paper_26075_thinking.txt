To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Interactive Image Generation Using Scene Graphs" by Gaurav Mittal et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the use of the **Coco-Stuff dataset**, indicating that this dataset is significant for the experiments conducted in the paper. The introduction may provide additional context or details about the dataset.

Next, I will look into **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they explicitly mention the **2017 COCO-Stuff dataset**, detailing its composition, including the number of images, the types of annotations (bounding boxes and segmentation masks), and the categories included. This section is crucial for understanding how the dataset is utilized in their research.

After identifying the dataset, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the **Coco-Stuff dataset**. The citation provided in the paper is:
> Holger Caesar, Jasper Uijlings, and Vittorio Ferrari. *Coco-stuff: Thing and stuff classes in context*. CoRR, abs/1612.03716, 5:8, 2016.

Additionally, I will also look for any other datasets mentioned throughout the paper, especially in the **experiments** or **related work** sections. However, in this case, the focus is primarily on the **Coco-Stuff dataset**.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will summarize the dataset details, including its name, description, and citation, ensuring that I adhere to the required format for clarity and completeness.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format that can be easily reviewed or processed further.
