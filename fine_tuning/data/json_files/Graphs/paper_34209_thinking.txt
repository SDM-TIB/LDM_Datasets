To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SiGNN: A Spike-induced Graph Neural Network for Dynamic Graph Representation Learning" by Dong Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that extensive experiments were conducted on various real-world dynamic graph datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they mention three datasets:

1. **DBLP Dataset**: This dataset represents an academic co-authorship network, capturing collaborations in scholarly publications. The authors provide statistics about the dataset, including the number of nodes, edges, classes, and time steps.

2. **Tmall Dataset**: Derived from e-commerce sales data, this dataset forms a bipartite graph representing consumer-product interactions. The authors also provide detailed statistics for this dataset.

3. **Patent Dataset**: This dataset illustrates the citation network among U.S. patents, showcasing the knowledge flow in patent innovations. Again, the authors provide statistics similar to the other datasets.

To ensure I have the correct citations, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. Here, I will look for the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the experiments section. 

The citations I find are:

- For the **DBLP Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Derek Greene, Donal Doyle, and Padraig Cunningham. *Tracking the evolution of communities in dynamic social networks*. In 2010 International Conference on Advances in Social Networks Analysis and Mining, pages 176–183. IEEE, 2010.

- For the **Tmall Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yuanfu Lu, Xiao Wang, Chuan Shi, Philip S Yu, and Yanfang Ye. *Temporal network embedding with micro-and macro-dynamics*. In Proceedings of the 28th ACM International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management, pages 469–478, 2019.

- For the **Patent Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Bronwyn H Hall, Adam B Jaffe, and Manuel Trajtenberg. *The NBER patent citation data file: Lessons, insights and methodological tools*. 2001.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their corresponding citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset along with its citation. This will ensure that I have accurately captured all necessary details for further processing or review.
