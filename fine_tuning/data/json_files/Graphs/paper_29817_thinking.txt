To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Graph Component Contrastive Learning for Concept Relatedness Estimation" by Yueen Ma et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that empirical results are shown on three datasets, which indicates that I need to look for their names and details.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention:

1. **WORD Dataset**: This dataset is described as collecting English concepts from Wikipedia, including 19,176 concept pairs. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Ein-Dor, L., Halfon, A., Kantor, Y., Levy, R., Mass, Y., Rinott, R., Shnarch, E., & Slonim, N. (2018). *Semantic Relatedness of Wikipedia Concepts - Benchmark Data and a Working Solution*. In LREC. European Language Resources Association (ELRA).

2. **CNSE Dataset**: This dataset contains 29,063 news article pairs from major internet news providers in China. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Liu, B., Niu, D., Wei, H., Lin, J., He, Y., Lai, K., & Xu, Y. (2019). *Matching Article Pairs with Graphical Decomposition and Convolutions*. In ACL (1), 6284–6294. Association for Computational Linguistics.

3. **CNSS Dataset**: This dataset consists of 33,503 news article pairs, also created by Liu et al. (2019). The citation is the same as for the CNSE dataset:
   > Liu, B., Niu, D., Wei, H., Lin, J., He, Y., Lai, K., & Xu, Y. (2019). *Matching Article Pairs with Graphical Decomposition and Convolutions*. In ACL (1), 6284–6294. Association for Computational Linguistics.

After identifying these datasets, I will ensure that I have the correct citations for each one, as they are crucial for proper referencing.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including their descriptions and citations, into a structured format for easy access and review. This will ensure that all relevant details are captured accurately and comprehensively.
