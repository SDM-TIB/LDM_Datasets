To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Mine yOur owN Anatomy: Revisiting Medical Image Segmentation with Extremely Limited Labels" by Chenyu You et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on three benchmark datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically provide detailed information about the datasets used. In this section, they explicitly mention three datasets:

1. **ACDC Dataset**: This dataset is described as containing 200 3D cardiac cine MRI scans with expert annotations for three classes (left ventricle, myocardium, and right ventricle). The authors specify the training, validation, and testing splits.

2. **LiTS Dataset**: The paper states that this dataset includes 131 contrast-enhanced 3D abdominal CT volumes with expert annotations for two classes (liver and tumor). The authors also mention the training and testing splits for this dataset.

3. **MMWHS Dataset**: This dataset consists of 20 3D cardiac MRI scans with expert annotations for seven classes. The authors provide details about the training and testing splits as well.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

- **ACDC Dataset**:
  > Bernard, O., Lalande, A., Zotti, C., Cervenansky, F., Yang, X., Heng, P.-A., Cetin, I., Lekadir, K., Camara, O., Gonzalez Ballester, M. A. (2018).

- **LiTS Dataset**:
  > Bilic, P., Christ, P. F., Vorontsov, E., Chlebus, G., Chen, H., Dou, Q., Fu, C.-W., Han, X., Heng, P.-A., Hesser, J., et al. (2019). The liver tumor segmentation benchmark (LiTS). *arXiv preprint arXiv:1901.04056*.

- **MMWHS Dataset**:
  > Zhuang, X., & Shen, J. (2016). Multi-scale patch and multi-modality atlases for whole heart segmentation of MRI. *Medical Image Analysis*.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This systematic approach ensures that I capture all relevant details about the datasets used in the research paper.
