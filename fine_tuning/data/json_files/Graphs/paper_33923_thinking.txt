To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Graph Machine Learning through the Lens of Bilevel Optimization" by Amber Yijia Zheng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the research, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **experiments**. In this paper, it is likely that the authors will describe the datasets used for their experiments in detail. I will pay close attention to any specific names, descriptions, and characteristics of the datasets mentioned.

As I read through the relevant sections, I will take note of the following details for each dataset:
1. **Name of the dataset**: This is crucial for identification.
2. **Description**: A brief overview of what the dataset contains, including the type of data (e.g., graphs, node features, labels).
3. **Usage**: How the dataset is utilized in the experiments or analysis presented in the paper.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is important for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like "Cora," I would look for the original source or citation that describes the dataset in detail. This may involve searching for the dataset's original publication or repository.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citation for each dataset as per the requirements.

Finally, I will summarize the findings in a structured format, ensuring clarity and completeness in the documentation of each dataset extracted from the paper.
