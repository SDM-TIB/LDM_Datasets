To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Training GANs with Stronger Augmentations via Contrastive Discriminator" by Jongheon Jeong and Jinwoo Shin, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to find any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on various datasets, which indicates that there are datasets to be identified.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this paper, they mention using several datasets, including:

1. **CIFAR-10**: A well-known dataset consisting of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. The dataset is commonly used for training machine learning models.

2. **CIFAR-100**: Similar to CIFAR-10, this dataset contains 60,000 images but is divided into 100 classes, with 600 images per class.

3. **CelebA-HQ-128**: This dataset consists of 30,000 high-quality images of human faces, each of size 128x128 pixels. It is often used for tasks related to facial image generation.

4. **AFHQ**: The Animal Faces-HQ dataset contains approximately 15,000 images of animal faces at a resolution of 512x512 pixels, divided into three classes: dogs, cats, and wild animals.

5. **ImageNet**: A large-scale dataset with over 14 million images across thousands of categories, widely used for training deep learning models.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and further exploration of the datasets.

The full citations for the datasets mentioned in the paper are as follows:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or analysis.
