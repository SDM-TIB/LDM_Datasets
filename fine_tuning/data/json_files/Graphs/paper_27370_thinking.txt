To extract datasets from the research paper titled "RA-GCN: Graph Convolutional Network for Disease Prediction Problems with Imbalanced Data" by Mahsa Ghorbani et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on "three publicly available medical datasets," which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors describe their experiments on three datasets in the **Experiments and Results** section. I will focus on this section to gather detailed information about each dataset.

The datasets mentioned in the paper are:

1. **Pima Indian Diabetes Dataset**: This dataset is used for recognizing the diabetic status of patients and contains 768 samples with 7 features. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Smith, J. W., Everhart, J., Dickson, W., Knowler, W., & Johannes, R. (1988). Using the ADAP learning algorithm to forecast the onset of diabetes mellitus. In Proceedings of the Annual Symposium on Computer Applications in Medical Care (p. 261).

2. **Parkinson’s Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI)**: This dataset is used for detecting Parkinson’s disease and includes various features, including brain MRI data. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Marek, K., Jennings, D., Lasch, S., Siderowf, A., Tanner, C., Simuni, C., Coffey, K., Kieburtz, K., Flagg, E., Chowdhury, S., et al. (2011). The Parkinson Progression Marker Initiative (PPMI). Progress in Neurobiology, 95(4), 629-635.

3. **Haberman’s Survival Dataset**: This dataset is used to predict the survival status of breast cancer patients and contains 306 samples with 3 features. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Haberman, S. J. (1976). Generalized residuals for log-linear models. In Proceedings of the 9th International Biometrics Conference (pp. 104-122).

After identifying these datasets, I will ensure that I have the correct citations for each one, as they are crucial for proper referencing in any subsequent work or analysis.

Finally, I will compile the extracted information into a structured format that highlights the dataset names, descriptions, and citations, ensuring clarity and completeness for future reference.
