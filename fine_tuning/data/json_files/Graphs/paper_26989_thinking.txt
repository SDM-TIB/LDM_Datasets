To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On the spatial attention in spatio-temporal graph convolutional networks for skeleton-based human action recognition" by Negar Heidari and Alexandros Iosifidis, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview, but the introduction often contains more detailed information about the datasets used in the study.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of skeleton-based action recognition and reference various methods and datasets. However, I need to look for specific mentions of datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section VI), where the authors describe their experimental setup. Here, they mention using the **NTU-RGB+D dataset**, which is a well-known dataset for action recognition. The authors provide details about the dataset, including the number of action video clips, the number of classes, and the structure of the data.

The paper states that the NTU-RGB+D dataset consists of 56,880 action video clips from 60 different human action classes, captured by three cameras from different views. Each clip is represented as a tensor of size 3 × 300 × 25, where 300 is the number of skeletons and 25 is the number of body joints.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the NTU-RGB+D dataset. The relevant citation is:

- For **NTU-RGB+D dataset**:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry for the NTU-RGB+D dataset, ensuring to include the full citation as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the dataset used in the research.
