To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Two-Stream Joint Matching Based on Contrastive Learning for Few-Shot Action Recognition" by Long Deng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated on two widely used few-shot action recognition datasets, specifically **SSv2** and **Kinetics**. This suggests that these datasets are crucial to the research.

Next, I will delve into the **introduction** section, where the authors mention that the majority of videos in the SSv2 dataset are correlated with actions, emphasizing the importance of action relationship modeling. This reinforces the significance of the SSv2 dataset in their study.

In the **experiments section**, specifically section 4.1, the authors explicitly state that they evaluated their approach on two datasets: **Kinetics** and **Something-Something V2 (SSv2)**. They describe the dataset selection process, indicating that they chose 100 categories from each dataset, with specific splits for training, validation, and testing.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For **Something-Something V2 (SSv2)**, the citation is:
   > Raghav Goyal, Samira Ebrahimi Kahou, Vincent Michalski, Joanna Materzynska, Susanne Westphal, Heuna Kim, Valentin Haenel, Ingo Freund, Peter Yianilos, Moritz Mueller-Freitag, et al. *The “Something-Something” video database for learning and evaluating visual common sense*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 5842–5850, 2017.

2. For **Kinetics**, the citation is:
   > Joao Carreira and Andrew Zisserman. *Quo vadis, action recognition? A new model and the kinetics dataset*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 6299–6308, 2017.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets:

- **SSv2**: A dataset designed for learning and evaluating visual common sense, containing a variety of action categories.
- **Kinetics**: A large-scale dataset for action recognition, featuring a diverse set of action categories.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation, ready for structured output.
