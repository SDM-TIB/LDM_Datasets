To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On the Inclusion of Charge and Spin States in Cartesian Tensor Neural Network Potentials" by Guillem Simeon et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, method, results, and conclusion sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study but may not specify datasets. The introduction discusses the importance of charge and spin states but does not mention specific datasets yet.

Next, I will focus on the **method section**, where the authors describe their experiments. Here, they mention using a **custom-made dataset** and two publicly available datasets. I will look for specific names and details about these datasets.

In the **results section**, the authors discuss their experiments with the datasets. They mention:

1. **Toy Datasets (Dataset A and Dataset B)**: These datasets consist of molecular systems differing in total charge, with a total of 10,000 data points generated from 2,000 conformers per molecule. The details about how these datasets were constructed are provided, but they do not have a formal citation since they are custom datasets.

2. **SPICE PubChem Dataset**: This dataset is a subset of the SPICE dataset, which includes conformers of small drug-like molecules. The authors provide a specific version (1.1.4) and mention that it contains approximately 707,558 data points. 

3. **QMspin Dataset**: This dataset includes around 13,000 carbene structures optimized in both singlet and triplet states, totaling approximately 26,000 data points. The authors reference a previous work for this dataset.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for the publicly available datasets:

- For the **SPICE dataset**, the citation is:
  > Eastman, P.; Behara, P. K.; Dotson, D. L.; Galvelis, R.; Herr, J. E.; Horton, J. T.; Mao, Y.; Chodera, J. D.; Pritchard, B. P.; Wang, Y.; De Fabritiis, G.; Markland, T. E. SPICE, A Dataset of Drug-like Molecules and Peptides for Training Machine Learning Potentials. *Scientific Data* 2023, 10.

- For the **QMspin dataset**, the citation is:
  > Schwilk, M.; Tahchieva, D. N.; von Lilienfeld, O. A. Large yet bounded: Spin gap ranges in carbenes. 2020; https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.10600.

Since the toy datasets are custom and do not have a formal citation, I will note that they are available at a specified URL provided in the paper.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for the publicly available datasets and noting the custom datasets appropriately. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant information regarding the datasets used in the research paper.
