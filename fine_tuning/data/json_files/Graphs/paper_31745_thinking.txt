To extract datasets from the research paper titled "X-RLFlow: Graph Reinforcement Learning for Neural Network Subgraphs Transformation" by Guoliang He et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and evaluation sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a high-level overview of the research but may not detail specific datasets. The introduction might mention datasets used for comparison or evaluation, which is crucial for my extraction.

Next, I will focus on the **evaluation section** (Section 4), as this is where the authors typically discuss the datasets used for experiments. In this section, the authors mention evaluating their method on various deep neural networks (DNNs) such as **InceptionV3, SqueezeNet, ResNext-50, BERT, DALL-E, T-T, and ViT**. However, I need to confirm whether these DNNs are associated with specific datasets.

I will also check the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. The authors may refer to datasets indirectly through the DNNs they evaluate, so I will look for the original papers or sources that describe these datasets.

For example, I will look for the following datasets associated with the mentioned DNNs:

1. **ImageNet Dataset**: Used for training and evaluating models like InceptionV3 and SqueezeNet.
   - Citation: 
     > Olga Russakovsky, Jia Deng, Hao Sheng, et al. *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 115(3):211-252, 2015.

2. **Coco Dataset**: Often used for models like DALL-E.
   - Citation:
     > Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, Sergio F. G. Vasconcelos, et al. *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. In European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), 2014.

3. **BERT Dataset**: Typically trained on the BookCorpus and English Wikipedia.
   - Citation:
     > Jacob Devlin, Ming-Wei Chang, Kenton Lee, and Kristina Toutanova. *BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding*. In Proceedings of the 2019 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, 2019.

After identifying the datasets and their citations, I will ensure to document them accurately, as the full citation is essential for proper referencing.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for easy access and review, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its citation.
