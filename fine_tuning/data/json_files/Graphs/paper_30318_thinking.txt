To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MEIM: Multi-partition Embedding Interaction Beyond Block Term Format for Efficient and Expressive Link Prediction" by Hung-Nghiep Tran and Atsuhiro Takasu, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention the use of large real-world knowledge graphs, specifically citing YAGO as an example. This indicates that datasets related to knowledge graphs are likely included.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they mention three standard benchmark datasets:

1. **WN18RR**: A subset of WordNet containing lexical information.
2. **FB15K-237**: A subset of Freebase containing general facts.
3. **YAGO3-10**: A large dataset containing general facts from Wikipedia.

The paper includes a table (Table 1) that summarizes the statistics for these datasets, confirming their use in the experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **WN18RR**, the citation is:
  > Tim Dettmers, Pasquale Minervini, Pontus Stenetorp, and Sebastian Riedel. *Convolutional 2D Knowledge Graph Embeddings*. In Proceedings of the 32nd AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, pages 1811–1818, 2018.

- For **FB15K-237**, the citation is:
  > Kristina Toutanova and Danqi Chen. *Observed versus latent features for knowledge base and text inference*. In Proceedings of the 3rd Workshop on Continuous Vector Space Models and Their Compositionality, pages 57–66, 2015.

- For **YAGO3-10**, the citation is:
  > Farzaneh Mahdisoltani, Joanna Biega, and Fabian M. Suchanek. *YAGO3: A Knowledge Base from Multilingual Wikipedias*. In Proceedings of the Conference on Innovative Data Systems Research, 2015.

With these citations in hand, I will compile the dataset information, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
