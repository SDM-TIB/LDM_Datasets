To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Interactive Audio-text Representation for Automated Audio Captioning with Contrastive Learning" by Chen Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. In the abstract, the authors highlight that their experimental results show significant performance on the **Clotho dataset**. This indicates that a dataset is indeed involved.

Next, I will delve into the **introduction** section, where the authors discuss the challenges of automated audio captioning and mention the **Clotho dataset** again, emphasizing its importance for their experiments.

In the **experiments section**, specifically **section 3.1 (Database)**, the authors provide detailed information about the **Clotho dataset**. They describe it as being collected from the Freesound archive, consisting of audio clips ranging from 15 to 30 seconds, with each clip annotated by five different annotators, resulting in a total of 24,420 captions for the training set and 5,225 captions for the test set. This section confirms that the Clotho dataset is the primary dataset used in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Clotho dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:
> K. Drossos, S. Lipping, and T. Virtanen. *Clotho: An audio captioning dataset*. In ICASSP 2020-2020 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP). IEEE, 2020, pp. 736â€“740.

Since the Clotho dataset is the only dataset mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring to include the full citation.

After gathering all the necessary details, I will prepare the dataset entry for the Clotho dataset, ready for any further processing or review.
