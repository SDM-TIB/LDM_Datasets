To extract datasets from the research paper titled "What is the state of the art? Accounting for multiplicity in machine learning benchmark performance" by Kajsa Møllersen and Einar Holsbø, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and related work sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned or referenced. The introduction discusses the importance of benchmark datasets in evaluating machine learning methods, which suggests that datasets may be discussed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments and results sections** to identify any specific datasets used in the analysis. In this paper, the authors mention a specific Kaggle competition, the **SIIM-ISIC Melanoma Classification competition**, which is a clear indication that a dataset is involved.

In the **discussion section**, the authors provide details about the dataset used in the competition, stating that it consists of over 40,000 images of skin lesions, split into training, validation, and test sets. This is crucial information that confirms the dataset's relevance to their research.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset mentioned. The authors reference the dataset in the context of the competition, and I will need to ensure I capture the correct citation for it.

The citation for the **SIIM-ISIC Melanoma Classification competition dataset** is:
> Veronica Rotemberg, Nicholas Kurtansky, Brigid Betz-Stablein, Liam Caffery, Emmanouil Chousakos, Noel Codella, Marc Combalia, Stephen Dusza, Pascale Guitera, David Gutman, Allan Halpern, Brian Helba, Harald Kittler, Kivanc Kose, Steve Langer, Konstantinos Lioprys, Josep Malvehy, Shenara Musthaq, Jabpani Nanda, Ofer Reiter, George Shih, Alexander Stratigos, Philipp Tschandl, Jochen Weber, and H. Peter Soyer. *A patient-centric dataset of images and metadata for identifying melanomas using clinical context*. Scientific Data, 2021, 8:1, 1-8. doi: 10.1038/s41597-021-00815-z.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring that I include the full citation as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the dataset used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
