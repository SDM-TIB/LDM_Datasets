To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Efficient and Accurate Physics-aware Multiplex Graph Neural Networks for 3D Small Molecules and Macromolecule Complexes" by Shuo Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method on datasets related to small molecules and macromolecule complexes, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for evaluation. They state that they use two benchmark datasets:

1. **QM9**: This dataset is described as a widely used benchmark for predicting quantum chemical properties of small organic molecules, consisting of around 130,000 molecules with up to 9 non-hydrogen atoms.

2. **PDBbind**: This dataset is a collection of experimentally measured binding affinities for protein-ligand complexes, which contains around 4,000 structures.

In the **experimental setup section**, the authors provide additional details about how they split the datasets for training, validation, and testing, which confirms their usage in the experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **QM9**, the citation is:
  > Raghunathan Ramakrishnan, Pavlo O Dral, Matthias Rupp, and O Anatole Von Lilienfeld. *Quantum chemistry structures and properties of 134 kilo molecules*. Scientific Data, 1(1):140, 2014.

- For **PDBbind**, the citation is:
  > Renxiao Wang, Xueliang Fang, Yipin Lu, and Shaomeng Wang. *The PDBbind database: Collection of binding affinities for protein-ligand complexes with known three-dimensional structures*. Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, 47(12):2977â€“2980, 2004.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all details are accurately represented for future reference or processing.
