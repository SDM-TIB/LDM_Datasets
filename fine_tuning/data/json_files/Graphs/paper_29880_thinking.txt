To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Cooperative Distribution Alignment via JSD Upper Bound" by Wonwoong Cho et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses empirical results on both simulated and real-world datasets, which suggests that there are datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In the introduction, the authors mention applications of their method, but I need to find specific dataset names and details.

In the **experiments section**, I will focus on subsections that describe the datasets used for evaluation. The authors mention using **UCI tabular datasets** (specifically MINIBOONE, GAS, HEPMASS, and POWER) and the **MNIST dataset** for their experiments. I will note these datasets and their characteristics as described in the paper.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets:

1. **UCI Datasets**: The UCI Machine Learning Repository is a well-known source for these datasets. The citation for the repository is:
   > Dua, D., & Graff, C. (2017). UCI Machine Learning Repository. Retrieved from http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml.

2. **MNIST Dataset**: The citation for the MNIST dataset is:
   > Deng, L. (2012). The MNIST database of handwritten digit images for machine learning research. IEEE Signal Processing Magazine, 29(6), 141-142.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
