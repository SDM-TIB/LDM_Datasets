To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning to Control Local Search for Combinatorial Optimization" by Jonas K. Falkner et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for evaluation. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets in relation to the research problem.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as it typically contains detailed information about the datasets used in the study. In this section, the authors may describe the datasets, including their characteristics, sizes, and any relevant details about how they were utilized in the experiments.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention several datasets related to combinatorial optimization problems, specifically:

1. **Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP)**: The authors refer to benchmark datasets for JSSP, specifically mentioning the **Taillard benchmark** which consists of various instances of job shop scheduling problems.

2. **Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP)**: The authors also mention using the **Uchoa benchmark** for the capacitated vehicle routing problem, which includes a variety of instances for testing.

Now, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Taillard benchmark**, the citation is:
  > Taillard, E. (1993). Benchmarks for basic scheduling problems. *European Journal of Operational Research*, 64(2), 278-285.

- For the **Uchoa benchmark**, the citation is:
  > Uchoa, E., Pecin, D., Pessoa, A., Poggi, M., Vidal, T., and Subramanian, A. (2017). New benchmark instances for the capacitated vehicle routing problem. *European Journal of Operational Research*, 257(3), 845-858.

With this information, I can now summarize the datasets in a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its citation.

In conclusion, I will compile the extracted datasets and their citations into a final structured output for further use or analysis.
