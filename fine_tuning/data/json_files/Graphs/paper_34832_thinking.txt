To extract datasets from the research paper titled "HC-GLAD: Dual Hyperbolic Contrastive Learning for Unsupervised Graph-Level Anomaly Detection" by Yali Fu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments on several real-world datasets, which indicates that datasets are likely discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they explicitly mention that they conducted experiments on **12 open-source datasets from TUDataset**. This is a strong indication that I need to identify these datasets and gather their details.

I will look for a subsection specifically dedicated to datasets, which is often labeled as "Datasets" or similar. In this case, the authors provide a table (Table 2) that lists the datasets along with their statistics, such as the number of graphs, average nodes, and average edges. This table is crucial for extracting the dataset names and their characteristics.

The datasets mentioned in the paper are:

1. **PROTEINS_full**: 1113 graphs, average nodes: 39.06, average edges: 72.82.
2. **ENZYMES**: 600 graphs, average nodes: 32.63, average edges: 62.14.
3. **AIDS**: 2000 graphs, average nodes: 15.69, average edges: 16.20.
4. **DHFR**: 467 graphs, average nodes: 42.43, average edges: 44.54.
5. **BZR**: 405 graphs, average nodes: 35.75, average edges: 38.36.
6. **COX2**: 467 graphs, average nodes: 41.22, average edges: 43.45.
7. **DD**: 1178 graphs, average nodes: 284.32, average edges: 715.66.
8. **REDDIT-B**: 2000 graphs, average nodes: 429.63, average edges: 497.75.
9. **HSE**: 8417 graphs, average nodes: 16.89, average edges: 17.23.
10. **MMP**: 7558 graphs, average nodes: 17.62, average edges: 17.98.
11. **p53**: 8903 graphs, average nodes: 17.92, average edges: 18.34.
12. **PPAR-gamma**: 8451 graphs, average nodes: 17.38, average edges: 17.72.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The paper mentions that the datasets are sourced from TUDataset, so I will look for the citation related to TUDataset.

The citation for TUDataset is:
> Christopher Morris, Nils M Kriege, Franka Bause, Kristian Kersting, Petra Mutzel, and Marion Neumann. *TUDataset: A collection of benchmark datasets for learning with graphs*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2007.08663, 2020.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their source, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citation for TUDataset as the authoritative source for all datasets listed.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format, ready for review or further processing.
