To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Unifying Graph Convolutional Neural Networks and Label Propagation" by Hongwei Wang and Jure Leskovec, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets used for experiments.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used in their evaluations. In this section, the authors mention that they conducted experiments on five datasets, which is a clear indication that I need to gather details about these datasets.

I will look for a subsection specifically dedicated to datasets, which is often labeled as "Datasets" or similar. In this case, the authors list the datasets as follows:

1. **Cora**: A citation network dataset where nodes represent documents, edges represent citation links, and each node has a sparse bag-of-words feature vector and a class label.

2. **Citeseer**: Similar to Cora, this dataset also consists of documents as nodes and citation links as edges, with corresponding features and labels.

3. **Pubmed**: Another citation network dataset, structured similarly to Cora and Citeseer.

4. **Coauthor-CS**: A co-authorship network where nodes represent authors and edges indicate co-authorship, with features representing paper keywords and class labels indicating fields of study.

5. **Coauthor-Phy**: Another co-authorship network, similar to Coauthor-CS, but focused on a different field.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find full citations for each dataset. The citations for the datasets are typically included in the context of their description or in the references to prior works that introduced these datasets.

For the datasets mentioned, I will compile the following citations:

- For **Cora**:
  > Sen, P., Namata, G., Bilgic, M., Getoor, L., Galligher, B., & Eliassi-Rad, T. (2008). Collective classification in network data. *AI Magazine*, 29(3).

- For **Citeseer**:
  > Sen, P., Namata, G., Bilgic, M., Getoor, L., Galligher, B., & Eliassi-Rad, T. (2008). Collective classification in network data. *AI Magazine*, 29(3).

- For **Pubmed**:
  > Sen, P., Namata, G., Bilgic, M., Getoor, L., Galligher, B., & Eliassi-Rad, T. (2008). Collective classification in network data. *AI Magazine*, 29(3).

- For **Coauthor-CS**:
  > Shchur, O., Mumme, M., Bojchevski, A., & G¨unnemann, S. (2018). Pitfalls of graph neural network evaluation. In *Neural Information Processing Systems Workshop on Relational Representation Learning*.

- For **Coauthor-Phy**:
  > Shchur, O., Mumme, M., Bojchevski, A., & G¨unnemann, S. (2018). Pitfalls of graph neural network evaluation. In *Neural Information Processing Systems Workshop on Relational Representation Learning*.

Now that I have gathered the dataset names and their citations, I will prepare to format this information according to the required structure for downstream processing. This will ensure that I have a comprehensive and accurate representation of the datasets used in the research paper.
