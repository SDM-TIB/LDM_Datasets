To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Digital Divides in Scene Recognition: Uncovering Socioeconomic Biases in Deep Learning Systems" by Michelle R. Greene et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract indicates that the study uses "nearly one million images from global and US sources, including user-submitted home photographs and Airbnb listings." This suggests that there are at least two datasets involved, but I need to confirm their names and details.

Next, I will look for specific sections that detail the datasets used. The **Methods** section is likely to contain this information, particularly under subsections that describe the datasets. I will focus on the following parts:

1. **Dollar Street Dataset**: The paper mentions that this dataset consists of approximately 1200 images of homes submitted by families in 54 countries. It is used to evaluate classification accuracy with pretrained deep convolutional neural networks (dCNNs). The dataset is referenced with a citation indicating its source.

2. **Airbnb Dataset**: The paper describes a second dataset comprising over 100,000 images sampled from 219 countries and regions from the Airbnb website. This dataset is used to extend the findings from the Dollar Street dataset and is analyzed for classification entropy.

3. **Airbnb: United States Counties**: A third dataset is mentioned, which includes nearly 800,000 images from all counties in each US state and territory, also sourced from Airbnb. This dataset is used to assess the impact of socioeconomic demographics on classification performance.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **Dollar Street Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Dollar Street - photos as data to kill country stereotypes (August 9, 2023).

- For the **Airbnb Dataset**, while the paper does not provide a specific citation, it is implied that the dataset is derived from Airbnb listings, which may not have a formal citation but can be referenced as:
  > Airbnb, Inc. (2021). Images scraped from Airbnb listings.

- For the **Airbnb: United States Counties** dataset, similar to the previous dataset, it is derived from Airbnb listings and can be referenced in the same manner.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations as required. Each dataset will be clearly described, including the number of images, the source, and any relevant details about its use in the study.

Finally, I will prepare the structured output for these datasets, ready for further processing or review.
