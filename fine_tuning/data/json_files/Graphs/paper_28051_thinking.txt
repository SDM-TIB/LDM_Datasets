To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-Echo LiDAR for 3D Object Detection" by Yunze Man et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors collected both a real-world and a synthetic dataset, which suggests that specific details about these datasets will be provided later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, particularly **subsection 4.1 (Dataset)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they clearly outline two datasets:

1. **Real Dataset**: This dataset was collected using a roof-mounted prototype LiDAR on a vehicle driving around a North American city. It consists of 35,850 frames with 3D oriented bounding boxes for 'Person' and 'Car' classes. The authors provide specific details about the dataset's structure and the types of measurements included.

2. **Synthetic Dataset**: This dataset was generated using the CARLA simulator and includes 26,043 frames for training and 8,682 frames for testing. It also contains 3D oriented bounding boxes and segmentation annotations for various classes, including 'Car', 'Person', and 'Cyclist'.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The authors reference the CARLA simulator, which is crucial for the synthetic dataset. The citation for CARLA is:

- **CARLA Simulator**:
  > Alexey Dosovitskiy, German Ros, Felipe Codevilla, Antonio Lopez, and Vladlen Koltun. *Carla: An open urban driving simulator*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1711.03938, 2017.

The Real Dataset does not have a specific citation in the references, as it is an original dataset collected by the authors. However, I will note that it is a proprietary dataset created for the purposes of this research.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citations for the datasets where applicable. This will allow for clear documentation of the datasets used in the research.
