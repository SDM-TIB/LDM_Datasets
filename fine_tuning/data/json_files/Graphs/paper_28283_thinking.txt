To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An Apparatus for the Simulation of Breathing Disorders" by Harry J. Davies et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract discusses the generation of surrogate data for breathing disorders, which suggests that there may be datasets involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors discuss the importance of understanding respiratory waveforms for different breathing disorders. They mention the use of an apparatus to simulate obstructive breathing disorder waveforms, which indicates that data related to these simulations may be collected.

In the **methods section**, I will look for specific details about the experiments conducted, including the number of subjects, the types of measurements taken, and any datasets generated. The authors describe evaluations with tidal breathing in subjects and the collection of various measurements, including FEV1/FVC ratios and photoplethysmography (PPG) data. This suggests that there are datasets related to these measurements.

I will also check the **results section** for any mention of specific datasets or data characteristics. The authors present findings related to tidal breathing waveforms and FEV1/FVC ratios, which may imply the existence of datasets that contain this information.

Finally, I will consult the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets or related works that are referenced. This is crucial for providing proper attribution.

Based on my reading, I will identify the following datasets:

1. **Surrogate Breathing Disorder Waveform Dataset**: This dataset is generated using the apparatus described in the paper, which simulates various obstructive breathing disorders. It includes measurements from healthy subjects across different tube diameters, capturing a range of FEV1/FVC ratios.

2. **Photoplethysmography (PPG) Dataset**: This dataset consists of PPG recordings taken during tidal breathing with the apparatus. It is used for training machine learning models to classify chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

Next, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the references section. For example, if the authors refer to previous works that describe similar datasets or methodologies, I will include those citations.

After compiling this information, I will ensure that each dataset is clearly described, including its purpose, the type of data it contains, and the context in which it was collected. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets extracted from the paper, along with their proper citations.
