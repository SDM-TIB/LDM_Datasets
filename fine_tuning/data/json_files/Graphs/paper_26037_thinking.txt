To extract datasets from the research paper titled "What Object Should I Use? - Task Driven Object Detection" by Johann Sawatzky et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and the datasets section** to pinpoint any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract introduces the **COCO-Tasks dataset**, which is a key dataset for the research, indicating that it is essential to gather details about it.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (COCO-Tasks Dataset)**, where the authors provide a comprehensive description of the dataset. They mention that the COCO-Tasks dataset comprises about **40,000 images** with annotations for **14 tasks**. This section will provide specific details about the dataset's structure, the number of images, and the nature of the annotations.

In this section, the authors also explain how the dataset is derived from the **COCO dataset** and provide statistics about the tasks and the number of selected object categories. This information is crucial for understanding the dataset's context and its relevance to the research.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the COCO dataset, as it is foundational to the COCO-Tasks dataset. The citation for the COCO dataset is:
> Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, Serge Belongie, James Hays, Pietro Perona, Deva Ramanan, Piotr Doll√°r, and C Lawrence Zitnick. *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. In Proceedings of the European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), 2014.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the COCO-Tasks dataset as well. The authors do not provide a separate citation for the COCO-Tasks dataset, but since it is derived from the COCO dataset, I will reference the COCO dataset citation.

The final entries for the datasets will be:

1. **COCO-Tasks Dataset**: A dataset comprising about 40,000 images with annotations for 14 tasks, derived from the COCO dataset.

2. **COCO Dataset**: The foundational dataset used to create the COCO-Tasks dataset.

After gathering all necessary information, I will prepare the dataset entries for further processing or review.
