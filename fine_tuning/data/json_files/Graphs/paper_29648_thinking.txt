To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Rethinking Graph Neural Networks for Anomaly Detection" by Jianheng Tang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their proposed method on **four large-scale anomaly detection datasets**, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention:

1. **YelpChi Dataset**: This dataset is used for detecting anomalous reviews on Yelp.com. It includes three edge types related to user and product interactions.

2. **Amazon Dataset**: This dataset is aimed at identifying anomalous users who write fake product reviews in the Musical Instrument category on Amazon.com. It also includes three types of relationships among users and products.

3. **T-Finance Dataset**: A newly released dataset based on a transaction network, used to find anomalous accounts. It contains features related to user activities and transaction records.

4. **T-Social Dataset**: Another newly released dataset based on a social network, similar in structure to T-Finance, but larger in scale.

In the **results section**, the authors reference these datasets again, confirming their use in the experiments and providing additional context about their characteristics.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- **YelpChi Dataset**:
  > Rayana, S., & Akoglu, L. (2015). Collective opinion spam detection: Bridging review networks and metadata. In KDD (pp. 985–994).

- **Amazon Dataset**:
  > McAuley, J. J., & Leskovec, J. (2013). From amateurs to connoisseurs: modeling the evolution of user expertise through online reviews. In WWW (pp. 897–908).

- **T-Finance Dataset**: The authors do not provide a specific citation for this dataset, as it is newly introduced in their work.

- **T-Social Dataset**: Similar to T-Finance, this dataset is also newly introduced and does not have a separate citation.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for the datasets that have them, while noting that T-Finance and T-Social are new datasets introduced by the authors.

This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture the datasets and their citations for further processing or review.
