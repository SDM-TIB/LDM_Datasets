To extract datasets from the research paper titled "P2SDF for Neural Indoor Scene Reconstruction" by Jing Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. In the abstract, the authors mention that they perform experiments on the **ScanNet** and **7-Scenes** datasets. This indicates that these datasets are likely important for the research and should be included.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments** section. In the introduction, the authors state that they conduct experiments on **ScanNet (V2)** and **7-Scenes**, providing a clear indication of the datasets used.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide additional details about these datasets. They describe **ScanNet (V2)** as a large-scale dataset containing around 2.5 million RGB-D images captured in 1613 indoor scenes. The **7-Scenes** dataset consists of RGB-D frames captured by a tracked Kinect RGB-D camera, which is used to obtain dense 3D models and camera poses.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For **ScanNet (V2)**, the citation is:
   > A. Dai, A. X. Chang, M. Savva, M. Halber, T. Funkhouser, and M. Nießner. *ScanNet: Richly-annotated 3D reconstructions of indoor scenes*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 5828–5839, 2017.

2. For **7-Scenes**, the citation is:
   > J. Shotton, B. Glocker, C. Zach, S. Izadi, A. Criminisi, and A. Fitzgibbon. *Scene coordinate regression forests for camera relocalization in RGB-D images*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 2930–2937, 2013.

Having gathered all necessary information, I will now compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes the full citation as required. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details regarding the datasets used in the research.
