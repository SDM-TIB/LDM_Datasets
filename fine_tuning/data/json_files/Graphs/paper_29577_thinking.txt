To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Robust Task-Oriented Dialogue Generation with Contrastive Pre-training and Adversarial Filtering" by Shiquan Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the investigation of data artifacts in popular datasets like **MultiWOZ**, which indicates that this dataset is likely to be a primary focus.

Next, I will look closely at the **introduction** section, where the authors mention their analysis of the **MultiWOZ** dataset. They highlight its significance in task-oriented dialogue studies, suggesting that it is a key dataset for their experiments.

In the **experiments section**, specifically **section 6.1 (Datasets and Metrics)**, the authors confirm that they use **MultiWOZ** version 2.2 as the main dialogue dataset for their experiments. They also mention that this version fixes annotation errors and improves data quality, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's relevance.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the **MultiWOZ** dataset. The relevant citation is:

- **MultiWOZ**:
  > Budzianowski, P., Wen, T.-H., Tseng, B.-H., Casanueva, I., Ultes, S., Ramadan, O., & Gasic, M. (2018). *MultiWOZ: A Large-Scale Multi-Domain Wizard-of-Oz Dataset for Task-Oriented Dialogue Modelling*. In Proceedings of the 2018 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (pp. 5016â€“5026).

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry for **MultiWOZ** using the required format, ensuring that the full citation is included.

In summary, I have identified **MultiWOZ** as the primary dataset used in the paper, confirmed its significance in the context of the research, and retrieved its full citation for documentation.
