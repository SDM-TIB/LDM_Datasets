To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Intra and Inter-Camera Invariance for Isolated Camera Supervised Person Re-identification" by Menglin Wang and Xiaojin Gong, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and the introduction often discusses the datasets used in the context of the research problem.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention the challenges of person re-identification and refer to the need for large-scale datasets. However, I need to look for specific dataset names.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention evaluating their method on subsets of two benchmark datasets: **Market-1501** and **MSMT17**. They also specify that they generated camera-isolated versions of these datasets, referred to as **Market-SCT** and **MSMT-SCT**.

I will then gather detailed information about these datasets, including their characteristics and how they were modified for the experiments. The paper provides statistics about the original datasets and their camera-isolated versions, which is crucial for understanding the context of the experiments.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **Market-1501**, the citation is:
  > Zheng, L., Shen, L., Tian, L., Wang, S., Wang, J., & Tian, Q. (2015). Scalable Person Re-identification: A Benchmark. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2015, 2156-2163. doi:10.1109/ICCV.2015.223.

- For **MSMT17**, the citation is:
  > Wei, L., Zhang, S., Gao, W., & Tian, Q. (2018). Person Transfer GAN to Bridge Domain Gap for Person Re-Identification. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2018, 2200-2208. doi:10.1109/CVPR.2018.00016.

With this information, I can now summarize the datasets used in the research paper, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the study.
