To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning from History: Task-agnostic Model Contrastive Learning for Image Restoration" by Gang Wu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiment sections** to pinpoint any datasets that are explicitly referenced. The abstract mentions improvements in image restoration tasks, which suggests that datasets are likely involved, especially since the authors discuss performance metrics.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, where the authors detail the specific image restoration tasks they conducted. They mention using several datasets for different tasks, which is crucial for my extraction.

1. **RESIDE indoor dataset**: This dataset is used for image dehazing tasks. The authors report significant improvements in performance metrics when using their proposed method on this dataset.

2. **SPA-Data**: This dataset is utilized for image deraining tasks. The authors indicate that their method achieves notable improvements on this dataset as well.

3. **Manga109**: This dataset is mentioned in the context of image super-resolution tasks. The authors report performance improvements when their method is applied to this dataset.

4. **DIV2K**: This dataset is referenced for training in the image super-resolution task. The authors specify that they used 800 images from this dataset.

5. **Rain200L and Rain200H**: These datasets are used for image deraining tasks, and the authors mention improvements in performance metrics when their method is applied to these datasets.

6. **GoPro dataset**: This dataset is used for image deblurring tasks, and the authors evaluate their method on this dataset.

Now, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations for further processing or review.
