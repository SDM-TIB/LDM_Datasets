To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An Information-Theoretic and Contrastive Learning-based Approach for Identifying Code Statements Causing Software Vulnerability" by Van Nguyen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on "real-world datasets of 200k+ C/C++ functions," which indicates that datasets are involved. I will look for specific names and details of these datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly the part where the authors describe their experimental setup. Here, they mention using three datasets:

1. **CWE-399 Dataset**: This dataset contains 1,010 and 1,313 vulnerable/non-vulnerable functions for resource management error vulnerabilities.
2. **CWE-119 Dataset**: This dataset includes 5,582 and 5,099 vulnerable/non-vulnerable functions for buffer error vulnerabilities.
3. **Fan et al.'s Dataset**: This is a large C/C++ dataset containing 188,636 source code functions collected from 348 open-source GitHub projects, with a ratio of vulnerable functions being 5.7%.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The citations I found are:

- For the **CWE-399 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Li, Z.; Zou, D.; Xu, S.; Jin, H.; and Chen, Z. (2018). *VulDeePecker: A Deep Learning-Based System for Vulnerability Detection*. CoRR, abs/1801.01681.

- For the **CWE-119 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Li, Z.; Zou, D.; Xu, S.; Jin, H.; and Chen, Z. (2018). *SySeVR: A Framework for Using Deep Learning to Detect Software Vulnerabilities*. IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing.

- For **Fan et al.'s Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Fan, J.; Li, Y.; Wang, S.; and Nguyen, T. N. (2020). *A C/C++ Code Vulnerability Dataset with Code Changes and CVE Summaries*. The 17th International Conference on Mining Software Repositories.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets referenced in the paper along with their proper citations.
