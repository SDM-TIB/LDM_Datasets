To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Graph Communal Contrastive Learning" by Bolian Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the research context and any datasets that might be referenced. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their model on various real-world graphs, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors describe their experiments in **section 4 (Experiments)**, where they mention using six real graphs for evaluation. I will carefully note the names of these datasets and any relevant details provided.

The datasets mentioned in the paper are:

1. **Amazon-Computers**: A graph of co-purchase relations where nodes represent products and edges indicate co-purchase relationships.
2. **Amazon-Photo**: Similar to Amazon-Computers, this graph also represents co-purchase relations among products.
3. **Coauthor-CS**: An academic network based on the Microsoft Academic Graph, where nodes are authors and edges represent co-author relationships.
4. **WikiCS**: A reference network from Wikipedia, where nodes are articles and edges are hyperlinks between them.
5. **IMDB**: A movie network with two types of links: co-actor and co-director, where nodes represent movies.
6. **DBLP**: A paper graph with multiple types of links including co-author, co-paper, and co-term relationships.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **Amazon-Computers** and **Amazon-Photo**, the citation is:
  > Shchur, O., Mumme, M., Bojchevski, A., & Günnemann, S. (2018). Pitfalls of graph neural network evaluation. *arXiv preprint arXiv:1811.05868*.

- For **Coauthor-CS**, the citation is:
  > Shchur, O., Mumme, M., Bojchevski, A., & Günnemann, S. (2018). Pitfalls of graph neural network evaluation. *arXiv preprint arXiv:1811.05868*.

- For **WikiCS**, the citation is:
  > Mernyei, P., & Cangea, C. (2020). Wiki-cs: A wikipedia-based benchmark for graph neural networks. *arXiv preprint arXiv:2007.02901*.

- For **IMDB**, the citation is:
  > IMDB. (n.d.). Retrieved from https://www.imdb.com/.

- For **DBLP**, the citation is:
  > DBLP. (n.d.). Retrieved from https://dblp.uni-trier.de/.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented and properly cited.
