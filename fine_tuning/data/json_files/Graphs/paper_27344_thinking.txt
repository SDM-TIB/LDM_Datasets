To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Hierarchical Graph Representations in Digital Pathology" by Pushpak Pati et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. In the abstract, the authors mention the introduction of the **BReAst Carcinoma Subtyping (BRACS)** dataset, which is a clear indication that a dataset is present. I will note this down as a primary dataset of interest.

Next, I will look into the **methodology** and **results** sections, specifically focusing on any detailed descriptions of the datasets used. In the methodology section, the authors provide a comprehensive description of the BRACS dataset, including its size (4391 TRoIs from 325 H&E stained breast carcinoma WSIs) and the annotation process involving multiple pathologists. This information is crucial for understanding the dataset's context and application.

I will also check the **experiments** section to confirm that the BRACS dataset is utilized for evaluation, which it is, as the authors mention comparing their method against pathologists using this dataset.

Now, I will look for the **References** section to find the full citation for the BRACS dataset. The paper does not provide a separate citation for the dataset itself, but it does mention that the WSIs were selected from the archives of the Department of Pathology at the National Cancer Institute-IRCCS-Fondazione Pascale, Naples, Italy. Therefore, I will construct a citation based on this information.

Additionally, I will check if there are any other datasets mentioned in the paper. The authors also reference the **BACH dataset**, which is a publicly available microscopy image dataset. I will extract details about this dataset as well, including its size and the types of images it contains.

For the BACH dataset, I will also look for its citation in the references. The paper cites the BACH dataset as follows:
> G. Aresta et al., "BACH: Grand challenge on breast cancer histology images," in Medical Image Analysis, vol. 56, pp. 122–139, 2019.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for both the BRACS and BACH datasets.

In summary, the datasets I will extract from the paper are:
1. **BReAst Carcinoma Subtyping (BRACS) dataset** - A large cohort of breast TRoIs annotated with seven breast cancer subtypes.
   - Citation: (To be constructed based on the information provided in the paper)
   
2. **BACH dataset** - A publicly available microscopy image dataset consisting of 400 training images from four breast cancer subtypes.
   - Citation: G. Aresta et al., "BACH: Grand challenge on breast cancer histology images," in Medical Image Analysis, vol. 56, pp. 122–139, 2019.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for further processing or review.
