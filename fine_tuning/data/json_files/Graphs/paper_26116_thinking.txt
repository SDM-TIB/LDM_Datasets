To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Quantifying the Alignment of Graph and Features in Deep Learning" by Yifan Qian et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the datasets that might be discussed. The abstract mentions the use of several datasets for evaluating the proposed methods, which indicates that I should look for specific names and details in the subsequent sections.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Data Sets)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the datasets used in their study. I will carefully read through this section to extract the relevant information about each dataset, including the number of nodes, edges, features, and classes.

The datasets mentioned in this paper are:

1. **Constructive Example**: This dataset is constructed with 1,000 nodes and 10 planted communities, with specific features and graph structures aligned with the ground truth.

2. **CORA Dataset**: A well-known benchmark for classification algorithms, consisting of 2,485 nodes, 5,069 edges, 1,433 features, and 7 classes. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Sen, P., et al. *Cora Dataset*. Available at: https://linqs.soe.ucsc.edu/data.

3. **AMiner Dataset**: A newly constructed citation network dataset with 2,072 nodes, 4,299 edges, 500 features, and 7 classes. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Qian, Y., et al. *AMiner Dataset*. Available at: https://aminer.org/data.

4. **Wikipedia Dataset**: This dataset consists of 20,525 nodes, 215,056 edges, 100 features, and 12 classes. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Wikipedia. *Wikipedia Dataset*. Available at: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Random.

5. **Wikipedia I**: A subset of the Wikipedia dataset with 2,414 nodes, 8,163 edges, 100 features, and 5 classes.

6. **Wikipedia II**: Another subset of the Wikipedia dataset with 1,858 nodes, 8,444 edges, 100 features, and 5 classes.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to ensure that I have the correct citations for each dataset. If any dataset is not explicitly cited in the references, I will note that as well.

Finally, I will compile the extracted datasets and their citations into a structured format for easy reference and further analysis. This will ensure that I have a comprehensive understanding of the datasets used in the study and their relevance to the research findings.
