To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Overlapping Community Detection with Graph Neural Networks" by Oleksandr Shchur and Stephan GÃ¼nnemann, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors introduce "4 new datasets for overlapping community detection" which indicates that there are specific datasets to look for. The introduction further emphasizes the importance of these datasets for benchmarking and stimulating future research.

Next, I will navigate to **section 4 (Evaluation)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention the following datasets:

1. **Facebook Datasets**: These are collections of small ego-networks from the Facebook graph, specifically:
   - Facebook 348
   - Facebook 414
   - Facebook 686
   - Facebook 698
   - Facebook 1684
   - Facebook 1912

2. **Co-authorship Networks**: The authors also introduce datasets constructed from the Microsoft Academic Graph, which include:
   - Chemistry
   - Computer Science
   - Medicine
   - Engineering

In this section, the authors provide some statistics about these datasets, such as the number of nodes (N), edges (M), and the number of communities (C). However, I need to ensure I have the full citations for these datasets.

To find the full citations, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. The authors cite the Microsoft Academic Graph as a source for the co-authorship networks. The citation for this dataset is:

- Microsoft Academic Graph:
  > Microsoft Academic Graph. [n. d.]. Retrieved from https://kddcup2016.azurewebsites.net/.

For the Facebook datasets, the authors do not provide a specific citation in the references, but they are commonly referenced in the community detection literature. I will note that these datasets are widely used and can be cited as follows:

- Facebook Datasets:
  > McAuley, J. J., & Leskovec, J. (2014). Discovering social circles in ego networks. *TKDD*, 8(1), 1-29.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will summarize the information for each dataset:

1. **Facebook Datasets**:
   - Description: A collection of small ego-networks from the Facebook graph.
   - Citation: McAuley, J. J., & Leskovec, J. (2014). Discovering social circles in ego networks. *TKDD*, 8(1), 1-29.

2. **Co-authorship Networks**:
   - Description: Datasets constructed from the Microsoft Academic Graph, corresponding to research areas in Chemistry, Computer Science, Medicine, and Engineering.
   - Citation: Microsoft Academic Graph. [n. d.]. Retrieved from https://kddcup2016.azurewebsites.net/.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This systematic approach ensures that I have accurately captured all relevant datasets and their citations from the research paper.
