To extract datasets from the research paper titled "OpenCon: Open-world Contrastive Learning" by Yiyou Sun and Yixuan Li, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract states that the authors demonstrate the effectiveness of OpenCon on "challenging benchmark datasets," which suggests that there are specific datasets used in their experiments.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In the **experiments section**, the authors mention evaluating their method on standard benchmark image classification datasets, specifically **CIFAR-100** and **ImageNet**. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for their evaluation.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

1. **CIFAR-100**: 
   > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton, et al. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009.

2. **ImageNet**: 
   > Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, and Li Fei-Fei. *ImageNet: A Large-Scale Hierarchical Image Database*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 248–255, 2009.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use.

In summary, the datasets extracted from the paper are:
- **CIFAR-100** with citation: Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton, et al. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009.
- **ImageNet** with citation: Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, and Li Fei-Fei. *ImageNet: A Large-Scale Hierarchical Image Database*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 248–255, 2009.
