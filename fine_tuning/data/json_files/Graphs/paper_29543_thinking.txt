To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Streaming Noise Context Aware Enhancement for Automatic Speech Recognition in Multi-Talker Environments" by Joe Caroselli et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the challenges of multi-talker environments and mentions algorithms for speech enhancement, but it does not specify datasets. 

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experimental Setup)**, which is likely to contain information about the datasets used for the experiments. Here, the authors describe the data collection process, indicating that they used recordings made in a living-room lab environment. They mention that desired speech and noise were recorded separately using a three-microphone array, but they do not provide specific dataset names.

I will also look for any references to existing datasets in the **results and discussion sections**. However, the paper primarily discusses the performance of their algorithms rather than specific datasets.

Since the authors do not explicitly name any publicly available datasets, I will check the **References section** to see if they cite any datasets or related works that might have used datasets relevant to their study. 

Upon reviewing the references, I find that they cite various works related to speech recognition and enhancement, but none of them seem to refer to a specific dataset that was used in their experiments.

In conclusion, while the paper provides a detailed description of the experimental setup and the conditions under which the data was collected, it does not explicitly mention any named datasets. Therefore, I will note that no specific datasets were extracted from this paper, and I will document this finding accordingly.

Finally, I will summarize my findings, ensuring to include any relevant citations from the references that may pertain to the methodologies or datasets discussed in the context of the research, even if they are not directly used in this study.
