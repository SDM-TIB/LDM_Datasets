To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Heterogeneous Domain Generalization via Domain Mixup" by Yufei Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments based on the **Visual Decathlon benchmark**, which suggests that this benchmark may contain multiple datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors describe their evaluation methodology. They mention that the Visual Decathlon benchmark consists of ten heterogeneous domains, which include datasets like **ImageNet**, **CIFAR-100**, **Aircraft**, **Describable Textures**, **German Traffic Signs**, and others. This is a strong indication that these datasets are crucial for the study.

In the **experiments section**, the authors specifically mention the source domains (Ds) and target domains (Dt) used for their experiments. The source domains include:
- **CIFAR-100**: A dataset with 100 classes.
- **Daimler Pedestrian**: A dataset for pedestrian detection.
- **GTSRB (German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark)**: A dataset for traffic sign recognition.
- **Omniglot**: A dataset for character recognition.
- **SVHN (Street View House Numbers)**: A dataset for digit recognition.
- **ImageNet**: A large-scale dataset for image classification.

The target domains include:
- **Aircraft**: A dataset for fine-grained classification of aircraft.
- **Describable Textures**: A dataset for texture classification.
- **VGG-Flowers**: A dataset for flower classification.
- **UCF101**: A dataset for action recognition in videos.

Now, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. Here are the citations I need to extract:

1. **ImageNet**:
   > Olga Russakovsky et al. "Imagenet large scale visual recognition challenge." *International Journal of Computer Vision*, vol. 115, no. 3, pp. 211–252, Dec 2015.

8. **UCF101**:
   > Hakan Bilen et al. "Dynamic image networks for action recognition." In *CVPR*, 2016, pp. 3034–3042.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries with their full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented and attributed to its original source. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
