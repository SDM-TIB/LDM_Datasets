To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CLINE: Contrastive Learning with Semantic Negative Examples for Natural Language Understanding" by Dong Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges faced by pre-trained language models and the need for robust training methods. However, they do not explicitly mention datasets here.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Pilot Experiment and Analysis)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. They mention two specific datasets:

1. **IMDB Dataset**: This dataset is used for sentiment analysis, where the task is to predict the sentiment (positive or negative) of movie reviews.

2. **SNLI Dataset**: This dataset is utilized for natural language inference, where the goal is to determine the relationship between two sentences (entailment, contradiction, or neutral).

In **section 4.2 (Datasets)**, the authors provide additional context about the datasets used in their experiments. They mention four more datasets:

3. **PERSPECTRUM Dataset**: A natural language inference dataset that predicts whether a relevant perspective is for or against a given claim.

4. **BoolQ Dataset**: A reading comprehension dataset with boolean (yes or no) answers.

5. **AG Dataset**: A sentence-level classification dataset regarding four news topics: World, Sports, Business, and Science/Technology.

6. **MR Dataset**: A sentence-level sentiment classification dataset focused on positive and negative movie reviews.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
