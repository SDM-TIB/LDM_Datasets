To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An Empirical Study on Disentanglement of Negative-free Contrastive Learning" by Jinkun Cao et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. In the abstract, the authors mention benchmarking their method on **popular synthetic datasets and a real-world dataset CelebA**. This indicates that there are datasets involved, and I need to find their specific names and details.

Next, I will look for explicit mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. In section 5.1, the authors list the datasets used for evaluation, which include:

1. **dSprites**: A synthetic dataset designed for testing disentangled representation learning, containing images of simple shapes with various factors of variation.
2. **Cars3D**: A dataset consisting of 183 different car objects rendered from various elevations and azimuths.
3. **Shapes3D**: Another synthetic dataset that includes 3D shapes with multiple factors.
4. **SmallNORB**: A dataset for 3D object recognition, containing images of toys from different viewpoints and lighting conditions.
5. **CelebA**: A real-world dataset containing human face images with 40 binary attributes.

In the **references section**, I will find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use.
