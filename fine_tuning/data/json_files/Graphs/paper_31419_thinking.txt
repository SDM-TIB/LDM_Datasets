To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Unsupervised Facial Expression Representation Learning with Contrastive Local Warping" by Fanglei Xue et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets along with their full citations.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of unsupervised representation learning for facial expression analysis, which suggests that datasets are likely involved. I will look for any specific datasets mentioned in these sections.

Next, I will move on to the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In section 4.2, the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for training and evaluation:

1. **MS1M Dataset**: This dataset is described as a large-scale face recognition dataset containing approximately 3.8 million facial images from popular celebrities. It is used for pre-training the ContraWarping method.

2. **RAF-DB Dataset**: This dataset is noted as a large-scale facial expression recognition dataset with 30,000 facial images labeled into seven basic or compound expression categories. Each image is manually labeled multiple times to ensure reliability.

3. **AffectNet Dataset**: This dataset is mentioned as one of the most challenging facial expression recognition datasets, consisting of about one million facial images collected from the internet, with a subset of 280,000 images labeled in seven basic categories for training and testing.

4. **FEC Dataset**: This dataset is used for the facial expression retrieval task and consists of about 358,000 training triplet samples and 28,000 testing triplet samples.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

- For **MS1M Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yandong Guo, Lei Zhang, Yuxiao Hu, Xiaodong He, and Jianfeng Gao. *Ms-celeb-1m: A dataset and benchmark for large-scale face recognition*. In ECCV, pages 87–102, 2016.

- For **RAF-DB Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Shan Li, Weihong Deng, and JunPing Du. *Reliable Crowd-sourcing and Deep Locality-Preserving Learning for Expression Recognition in the Wild*. In CVPR, volume 28, pages 2584–2593, IEEE, July 2017.

- For **AffectNet Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Ali Mollahosseini, Behzad Hasani, and Mohammad H Mahoor. *Affectnet: A database for facial expression, valence, and arousal computing in the wild*. IEEE T-AC, 10(1):18–31, 2017.

- For **FEC Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Raviteja Vemulapalli and Aseem Agarwala. *A Compact Embedding for Facial Expression Similarity*. In CVPR, pages 5676–5685, June 2019.

Now that I have gathered the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
