To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Precise Weakly Supervised Object Detection via Interactive Contrastive Learning of Context Information" by Qi Lai and Chi-Man Vong, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted extensive experiments on widely used benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of weakly supervised object detection and mention the need for datasets with image-level annotations. This hints at the datasets they might have used, but I need to find specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for evaluation. They state that they employed the **PASCAL VOC 2007** and **MS COCO** datasets for their experiments. This is a clear indication of the datasets utilized in their research.

Now, I will gather detailed information about these datasets, including their characteristics and the context in which they were used. The paper mentions that the PASCAL VOC 2007 dataset consists of 20 semantic categories and 9,943 images, while the MS COCO dataset is larger, containing 80 object categories with a training set of 41K images and a validation set of 5K images.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **PASCAL VOC 2007 dataset**, the citation is:
   > M. Everingham, S. Eslami, L. Van Gool, C. K. Williams, J. Winn, and A. Zisserman. *The PASCAL Visual Object Classes Challenge: A Retrospective*. International Journal of Computer Vision, vol. 111, no. 1, pp. 98–136, 2015.

2. For the **MS COCO dataset**, the citation is:
   > T.-Y. Lin, M. Maire, S. Belongie, J. Hays, P. Perona, D. Ramanan, P. Dollár, and C. L. Zitnick. *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. In European Conference on Computer Vision, Springer, 2014, pp. 740–755.

With this information, I will summarize the datasets and their citations clearly.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that is ready for review or further processing.
