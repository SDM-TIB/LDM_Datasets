To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ImGCL: Revisiting Graph Contrastive Learning on Imbalanced Node Classification" by Liang Zeng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions "extensive experiments on multiple imbalanced graph datasets," which indicates that datasets are indeed used.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors describe their methodology and the datasets they utilized. In this section, they explicitly mention four datasets:

1. **Wiki-CS**: This dataset is described as a reference network constructed based on Wikipedia, where nodes represent articles about computer science, and edges represent hyperlinks between articles.

2. **Amazon-Computers**: This dataset consists of a network of co-purchase relationships from Amazon, where nodes represent goods and edges indicate that two goods are frequently bought together.

3. **Amazon-Photo**: Similar to the Amazon-Computers dataset, this dataset also represents co-purchase relationships but focuses on photo-related products.

4. **DBLP**: This dataset is a citation network constructed from the DBLP website, where nodes represent academic papers and edges represent citation relationships between them.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **Wiki-CS**, the citation is:
  > Zhu, Y., Xu, Y., Liu, Q., & Wu, S. (2021). An Empirical Study of Graph Contrastive Learning. In Thirty-fifth Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems Datasets and Benchmarks Track.

- For **Amazon-Computers** and **Amazon-Photo**, the citation is:
  > Shchur, O., Mumme, M., Bojchevski, A., & GÂ¨unnemann, S. (2018). Pitfalls of graph neural network evaluation. arXiv preprint arXiv:1811.05868.

- For **DBLP**, the citation is the same as above since it is also part of the datasets evaluated in the same paper.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
