To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Knowledge Soft Integration for Multimodal Recommendation" by Kai Ouyang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that extensive experiments were conducted on three benchmark datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed present in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this case, I find that in **section 4.1 (Datasets and Metrics)**, the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. They mention three publicly available datasets: **Baby**, **Sports**, and **Clothing**.

I will take note of the details provided for each dataset, including the types of modalities involved (textual and visual) and the statistics related to user-item interactions. The paper provides a table (Table 1) that summarizes the statistics of these datasets, which is crucial for understanding their characteristics.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The paper mentions that the datasets can be accessed at a specific URL, which is important for proper citation. However, I need to ensure that I provide the correct citation format as per academic standards.

The citations for the datasets are as follows:

1. **Baby Dataset**: 
   - Citation: "Baby dataset can be accessed at https://jmcauley.ucsd.edu/data/amazon"

2. **Sports Dataset**: 
   - Citation: "Sports dataset can be accessed at https://jmcauley.ucsd.edu/data/amazon"

3. **Clothing Dataset**: 
   - Citation: "Clothing dataset can be accessed at https://jmcauley.ucsd.edu/data/amazon"

Since all three datasets are from the same source, I will ensure to mention that they are part of the Amazon dataset collection.

Finally, I will compile the extracted information into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations. This will ensure that I have a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
