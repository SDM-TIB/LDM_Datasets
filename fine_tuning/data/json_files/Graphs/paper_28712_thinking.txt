To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "From Good to Best: Two-Stage Training for Cross-lingual Machine Reading Comprehension" by Nuo Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on two cross-lingual MRC benchmark datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors describe their evaluation methods. In this section, they mention using two datasets: **MLQA** and **XQUAD**. I will look for detailed descriptions of these datasets, including their characteristics and any relevant statistics.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide a table (Table 4) that summarizes the statistics of the datasets used. They mention:

1. **MLQA**: This dataset is used for evaluating cross-lingual machine reading comprehension and covers various languages. The statistics indicate that it has 87,599 training examples and includes multiple languages such as English, Arabic, German, Spanish, Hindi, and Vietnamese.

2. **XQUAD**: Another dataset for evaluating cross-lingual model performance, which consists of 11 languages. The authors also mention that they test their method with the same six languages as in MLQA.

Now, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **MLQA**, the citation is:
  > Lewis, P. S. H., Oguz, B., Rinott, R., Riedel, S., & Schwenk, H. (2020). MLQA: Evaluating Cross-lingual Extractive Question Answering. In Proceedings of the 58th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL), 7315â€“7330.

- For **XQUAD**, the citation is:
  > Asai, A., Eriguchi, A., Hashimoto, K., & Tsuruoka, Y. (2018). Multilingual Extractive Reading Comprehension by Runtime Machine Translation. CoRR, abs/1809.03275.

With this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research.
