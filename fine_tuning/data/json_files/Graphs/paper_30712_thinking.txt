To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Modeling Multivariate Biosignals With Graph Neural Networks and Structured State Space Models" by Siyi Tang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the datasets used in the study. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their model on three distinct biosignal classification tasks, which suggests that there are multiple datasets involved.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **methods** and **experiments** sections. In the experiments section, the authors describe the tasks they performed and the datasets they used for each task. I will pay close attention to any dataset names, descriptions, and relevant details.

From the text, I identify the following datasets:

1. **Temple University Hospital EEG Seizure Corpus (TUSZ)**: This dataset is used for seizure detection from electroencephalographic signals. It is publicly available and consists of EEG clips with a specific sampling rate and number of sensors.

2. **Dreem Open Dataset-Healthy (DOD-H)**: This dataset is used for sleep staging from polysomnographic signals. It includes overnight PSG recordings from multiple volunteers and is also publicly available.

3. **ICBEB ECG Dataset**: This dataset is used for 12-lead electrocardiogram classification. It is publicly available and contains ECG records annotated by multiple reviewers.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset from the **references section** of the paper:

- For the **Temple University Hospital EEG Seizure Corpus (TUSZ)**, the citation is:
  > Vassilis Kalofolias. *How to learn a graph from smooth signals*. In Proceedings of the 19th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics, volume 51 of Proceedings of Machine Learning Research, pages 920–929, Cadiz, Spain, 2016.

- For the **Dreem Open Dataset-Healthy (DOD-H)**, the citation is:
  > Antoine Guillot, Fabien Sauvet, Emmanuel H During, and Valentin Thorey. *Dreem open datasets: Multi-Scored sleep datasets to compare human and automated sleep staging*. IEEE Trans. Neural Syst. Rehabil. Eng., 28(9):1955–1965, September 2020.

- For the **ICBEB ECG Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Feifei Liu, Chengyu Liu, Lina Zhao, Xiangyu Zhang, Xiaoling Wu, Xiaoyan Xu, Yulin Liu, Caiyun Ma, Shoushui Wei, Zhiqiang He, Jianqing Li, and Eddie Ng Yin Kwee. *An open access database for evaluating the algorithms of electrocardiogram rhythm and morphology abnormality detection*. Journal of Medical Imaging and Health Informatics, 8(7):1368–1373, 2018.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
