To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "Identity Inference on Blockchain using Graph Neural Network" by Jie Shen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on two datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention two datasets: **ETHG** and **EOSG**. I will extract the relevant details about each dataset, including their characteristics and the context in which they were used.

1. **ETHG Dataset**: The authors describe ETHG as containing transaction records from Ethereum, specifically mentioning that it includes 1,660 phisher accounts and 1,700 non-phisher accounts with their 2-hop transaction records. This dataset is sourced from Xblock, a blockchain data platform for academic research.

2. **EOSG Dataset**: The EOSG dataset is described as being collected from various on-chain data sources, including the Enhanced Money Flow Graph (EMFG) and the Enhanced Account Creation Graph (EACG). It contains 229,907 normal accounts and 63,863 bot-like accounts.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the sources of these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

- For the **ETHG dataset**, the citation is:
  > Xblock. *Xblock: A blockchain data platform for academic research*. Available at: http://xblock.pro/

- For the **EOSG dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yuheng Huang et al. *Understanding (mis) behavior on the eosio blockchain*. Proceedings of the ACM on Measurement and Analysis of Computing Systems, 4(2):1â€“28, 2020.

Now that I have gathered all necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their respective citations.
