To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Risk Awareness in HTN Planning" by Ebaa Alnazer et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and it may mention specific datasets used in the study.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments or results sections** of the paper, as these sections typically detail the datasets used for evaluation. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

If the paper includes a **dedicated section on datasets**, I will examine it closely. This section often contains detailed descriptions of each dataset, including how they were collected, their structure, and any relevant statistics.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily.

For each dataset, I will note the following details:
1. **Dataset Name**: The official name of the dataset as mentioned in the paper.
2. **Description**: A brief description of the dataset, including its purpose and any relevant characteristics.
3. **Full Citation**: The complete citation for the dataset as provided in the references section of the paper.

If the dataset is derived from another source, I will ensure to cite the original source as well.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile it into a structured format that clearly presents each dataset along with its citation. This will ensure that the information is organized and easy to understand.

By following these steps, I will be able to extract and document the datasets from the paper effectively, ensuring that all citations are complete and accurate.
