To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MICE: Mixture of Contrastive Experts for Unsupervised Image Clustering" by Tsung Wei Tsai et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions evaluating the clustering performance of MiCE on "four widely adopted natural image datasets," which indicates that datasets are indeed used.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this section, the authors provide a table summarizing the statistics of the datasets used, which is crucial for identifying them. The datasets listed are:

1. **CIFAR-10**: This dataset consists of 60,000 images, with a size of 32 × 32 × 3 pixels, and contains 10 classes.
2. **CIFAR-100**: Similar to CIFAR-10, this dataset also has 60,000 images, with the same size, but it contains 100 classes.
3. **STL-10**: This dataset contains 13,000 images, with a size of 96 × 96 × 3 pixels, and has 10 classes.
4. **ImageNet-Dog**: This dataset consists of 19,500 images, also sized at 96 × 96 × 3 pixels, and contains 15 classes.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **CIFAR-10** and **CIFAR-100**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton, et al. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. Technical Report, 2009.

- For **STL-10**, the citation is:
  > Adam Coates, Andrew Ng, and Honglak Lee. *An analysis of single-layer networks in unsupervised feature learning*. In Proceedings of the Fourteenth International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics (AISTATS), pp. 215–223. JMLR Workshop and Conference Proceedings, 2011.

- For **ImageNet-Dog**, the citation is:
  > Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-jia Li, Kai Li, and Fei-fei Li. *ImageNet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pp. 248–255, 2009.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described with its name, description, and full citation, ready for structured output or further processing.
