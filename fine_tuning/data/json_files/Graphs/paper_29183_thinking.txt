To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MolNet: A Chemically Intuitive Graph Neural Network for Prediction of Molecular Properties" by Yeji Kim et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. In the abstract, the authors refer to the **BACE dataset** and the **ESOL dataset** as part of their evaluation, which indicates that these datasets are critical for understanding the performance of their proposed model.

Next, I will look into the **results and discussion** section, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of how they used these datasets. In the results, they mention that the BACE dataset contains 1547 experimental binary inhibition labels and that the ESOL dataset consists of 1128 aqueous solubility values. This confirms that both datasets are used for specific tasks: classification for BACE and regression for ESOL.

I will then check the **methods** section for any additional details about the datasets, such as their structure or specific characteristics. The authors mention that the BACE dataset was filtered to include only ligands with fewer than 200 heavy atoms, which is important for understanding the dataset's application.

After gathering this information, I will refer to the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and further exploration of the datasets.

1. **BACE Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Subramanian, G.; Ramsundar, B.; Pande, V.; Denny, R. A. Computational modeling of β-secretase 1 (BACE-1) inhibitors using ligand-based approaches. *J. Chem. Inf. Model.* 2016, 56, 1936–1949.

2. **ESOL Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Delaney, J. S. ESOL: estimating aqueous solubility directly from molecular structure. *J. Chem. Inf. Comput. Sci.* 2004, 44, 1000–1005.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly presents each dataset along with its citation. This will ensure that the datasets are accurately represented and can be easily referenced in future work.
