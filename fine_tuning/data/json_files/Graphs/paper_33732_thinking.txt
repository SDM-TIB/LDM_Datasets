To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Complete Instances Mining for Weakly Supervised Instance Segmentation" by Zecheng Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted empirical evaluations on the **PASCAL VOC 2012** and **MS COCO** datasets, indicating that these datasets are used in their experiments.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (section 4.1) where the authors provide more details about the datasets. Here, they describe the **PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset** as containing 10,582 images for training and 1,449 images for validation, comprising 20 object categories. They also mention the **MS COCO dataset**, which consists of 115K training images, 5K validation images, and 20K testing images across 80 object categories.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset**, the citation is:
  > Mark Everingham, Luc Van Gool, Christopher KI Williams, John Winn, and Andrew Zisserman. *The PASCAL Visual Object Classes (VOC) Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 88(2):303–338, 2010.

- For the **MS COCO dataset**, the citation is:
  > Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, Serge Belongie, James Hays, Pietro Perona, Deva Ramanan, Piotr Dollár, and C Lawrence Zitnick. *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. In Proceedings of the European Conference on Computer Vision, pages 740–755, 2014.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their full citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use. This process ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets referenced in the paper along with their proper citations.
