To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-label Guided Soft Contrastive Learning for Efficient Earth Observation Pretraining" by Yi Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the use of "large-scale satellite data" and "land-cover-land-use products," indicating that datasets are likely discussed.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors mention specific datasets such as **ESA WorldCover** and **Google Dynamic World**. These are key datasets that provide land cover information, which is crucial for the study.

In the **methodology section**, the authors describe how they built a new dataset called **SSL4EO-S12-ML** by matching images from the **SSL4EO-S12** dataset with land cover maps from **Dynamic World**. This section provides detailed information about the dataset's composition, including the number of images and the classes represented.

I will also check the **experiments and results sections** to see if any additional datasets are mentioned or used for evaluation. The authors reference several downstream tasks and datasets, including **BigEarthNet**, **EuroSAT**, and **DFC2020**, which are used to validate their model's performance.

Now, I will compile the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. Here are the datasets I have identified:

1. **SSL4EO-S12-ML**: This is a new dataset created by the authors. The citation is:
   > Yi Wang, C. M. Albrecht, N. A. A. Braham, L. Mou, and X. X. Zhu. *SSL4EO-S12: A large-scale multimodal, multitemporal dataset for self-supervised learning in earth observation*. IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Magazine, vol. 11, no. 3, pp. 98–106, 2023.

2. **Dynamic World**: This dataset provides continuous land cover mapping. The citation is:
   > C. F. Brown, S. P. Brumby, B. Guzder-Williams, T. Birch, S. B. Hyde, J. Mazzariello, W. Czerwinski, V. J. Pasquarella, R. Haertel, S. Ilyushchenko et al. *Dynamic world, near real-time global 10 m land use land cover mapping*. Scientific Data, vol. 9, no. 1, p. 251, 2022.

3. **ESA WorldCover**: This dataset provides global land cover maps. The citation is:

Lesiv, S. Carter, M. Herold, L. Li, N.-E. Tsendbazar, F. Ramoino, and O. Arino. *Esa worldcover 10 m 2020 v100*. Zenodo, 2021. [Online]. Available: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5571936

4. **BigEarthNet**: A large-scale dataset for land cover classification. The citation is:
   > G. Sumbul, M. Charfuelan, B. Demir, and V. Markl. *Bigearthnet: A large-scale benchmark archive for remote sensing image understanding*. In IGARSS 2019-2019 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium, pp. 5901–5904, 2019.

5. **EuroSAT**: A dataset for land use and land cover classification. The citation is:
   > P. Helber, B. Bischke, A. Dengel, and D. Borth. *Eurosat: A novel dataset and deep learning benchmark for land use and land cover classification*. IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing, vol. 12, no. 7, pp. 2217–2226, 2019.

6. **DFC2020**: A dataset for land cover semantic segmentation. The citation is:
   > M. Schmitt, L. Hughes, P. Ghamisi, N. Yokoya, and R. Hänsch. *IEEE grss data fusion contest*. 2020.

After gathering all this information, I will ensure that I have accurately documented each dataset's details and citations for further processing or review.
