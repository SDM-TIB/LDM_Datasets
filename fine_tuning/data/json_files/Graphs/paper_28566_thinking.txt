To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Metric-Based Multimodal Meta-Learning for Human Movement Identification via Footstep Recognition" by Muhammad Shakeel et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors used a **self-collected dataset of acoustic and vibration-based sensors** for their experiments, which suggests that a dataset is indeed present.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically looking for any detailed descriptions of the dataset. In this section, the authors mention that they collected a dataset consisting of **700 positive pairs** (where sound and vibration signals of a moving person are present) and **700 negative pairs** (where no human presence is detected). This gives me a clear understanding of the dataset's structure and purpose.

The authors also specify that the dataset contains **audio and geophone signals** recorded in an indoor lab environment, which is crucial for understanding the context of the dataset.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the dataset. However, since this dataset is self-collected and not published in a separate paper, there won't be a formal citation for it. Instead, I will note that the dataset is described as follows:

- **Self-Collected Dataset**: The dataset consists of 1400 pairs (700 positive and 700 negative) of audio and geophone signals associated with human footstep movements, collected in an indoor lab environment.

Since there is no formal citation for the dataset, I will document it as a self-collected dataset without a specific reference.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format for clarity, ensuring that I highlight the self-collected nature of the dataset and its significance in the context of the research.

In summary, the key dataset extracted from the paper is:
- **Self-Collected Dataset**: 1400 pairs (700 positive and 700 negative) of audio and geophone signals for human movement identification.

This dataset is crucial for the experiments conducted in the study, demonstrating the authors' approach to addressing data scarcity in multimodal learning for human movement detection.
