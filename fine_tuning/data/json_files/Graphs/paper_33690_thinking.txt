To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Link Prediction with Relational Hypergraphs" by Xingyue Huang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to find any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors validate their model on various relational hypergraph benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically looking for any subsections that detail the datasets used. In this section, the authors typically describe the datasets, their characteristics, and how they are utilized in the experiments.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find the following datasets mentioned:

1. **JF17K Dataset**: This dataset is used for inductive link prediction tasks. It consists of various relational data and is noted for its complexity and size.

2. **FB-AUTO Dataset**: Another dataset used for transductive link prediction tasks, which includes relational data from the Facebook social network.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

- For the **JF17K Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yifan Feng, Haoxuan You, Zizhao Zhang, Rongrong Ji, and Yue Gao. *Inductive relation prediction by subgraph reasoning*. In ICML, 2020.

- For the **FB-AUTO Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Bahare Fatemi, Perouz Taslakian, David Vazquez, and David Poole. *Knowledge hypergraphs: Prediction beyond binary relations*. In IJCAI, 2021.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and future reference. This will include the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all necessary details are captured for each dataset mentioned in the paper.
