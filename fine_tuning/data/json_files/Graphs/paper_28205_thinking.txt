To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network with Multi-view Representation Learning" by Zezhi Shao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that "extensive experiments on three real-world HG datasets demonstrate the significant superiority of our proposed MV-HetGNN." This indicates that there are specific datasets used for the experiments, which I need to identify.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors describe the datasets used in **section 5.1 (Experimental Setup)**. Here, they explicitly list three datasets:

1. **DBLP Dataset**: This dataset is a subset of DBLP, which includes authors, papers, terms, and conferences. It is used for node classification and clustering tasks.

2. **IMDb Dataset**: This dataset is a subset of IMDb, where each movie is labeled as one of three classes. It is also used for node classification and clustering tasks.

3. **Last.fm Dataset**: This dataset is a subset of Last.fm, used for link prediction tasks. It includes user-artist pairs and is divided into training, validation, and testing sets.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the **References section** of the paper. The citations are as follows:

- For the **DBLP dataset**, the citation is:
  > Ji, M., Sun, Y., Danilevsky, M., Han, J., & Gao, J. (2010). Graph regularized transductive classification on heterogeneous information networks. In ECML PKDD.

- For the **IMDb dataset**, the citation is:
  > Cantador, I., Brusilovsky, P., & Kuflik, T. (2011). 2nd workshop on information heterogeneity and fusion in recommender systems (hetrec 2011). In RecSys.

- For the **Last.fm dataset**, the citation is:
  > Cantador, I., Brusilovsky, P., & Kuflik, T. (2011). 2nd workshop on information heterogeneity and fusion in recommender systems (hetrec 2011). In RecSys.

With the datasets identified and their citations retrieved, I will now compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
