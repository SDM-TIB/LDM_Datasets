To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Digital Twin of Industrial Networked Control System based on Value of Information" by Van-Phuc Bui et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental evaluation sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract discusses the use of sensors in an Industrial Networked Control System, which suggests that there may be datasets related to sensor data or experimental results.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental evaluation section** where the authors describe their experimental setup. They mention using a **UWB module based on the IEEE 802.15.4-compatible Qorvo DWM1001C radio module** and an **IMU sensor integrated with an Arduino Nano 33 IoT kit**. This indicates that there are datasets related to the measurements taken from these sensors.

In this section, the authors also mention that they collected ground truth data using a **Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) sensor**. This is a crucial dataset as it serves as a reference for evaluating the accuracy of their algorithms.

I will now look for specific details about these datasets, including their characteristics, size, and any relevant information that can help describe them accurately.

1. **UWB Sensor Data**: The paper describes the use of UWB sensors operating in specific frequency bands. However, it does not provide a specific dataset name or citation for this data. I will note that this data is collected from the UWB module.

2. **IMU Sensor Data**: Similar to the UWB data, the IMU sensor data is mentioned but lacks a specific dataset name or citation. I will document this as well.

3. **Ground Truth Data**: The authors state that they gathered ground truth data using a LiDAR sensor, which is crucial for validating their results. However, the paper does not provide a specific citation for this dataset either.

Next, I will check the **References section** to see if any of the cited works correspond to datasets or provide additional context for the datasets mentioned. 

- The paper cites various works, but none of them appear to be direct datasets. They are primarily related to methodologies or technologies used in the study.

Since the paper does not provide explicit dataset names or citations, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **UWB Sensor Data**: Collected from the Qorvo DWM1001C module, used for positioning tasks.
2. **IMU Sensor Data**: Collected from the Arduino Nano 33 IoT kit, used for measuring acceleration and angular velocity.
3. **Ground Truth Data**: Collected using a LiDAR sensor for accuracy validation.

For the citations, since specific datasets were not named in the paper, I will note that the UWB and IMU data are derived from the respective hardware modules mentioned, and the ground truth data is based on LiDAR technology, but no formal citation can be provided.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for clarity, ensuring that I highlight the lack of specific dataset citations while documenting the sources of the data used in the experiments.
