To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-Modality Deep Network for JPEG Artifacts Reduction" by Xuhao Jiang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may highlight the datasets used for evaluation. In this case, the authors mention evaluating their method on specific datasets, which is a good starting point.

Next, I will look into **section 4.1 (Datasets and Evaluation Methodology)**, where the authors typically provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention two datasets: 

1. **CUB Dataset**: This dataset contains images of 200 species of birds, totaling 11,788 images, with specific splits for training and testing.
2. **Oxford-102 Dataset**: This dataset consists of 102 flower categories, with a total of 8,189 images, also split into training and testing sets.

I will ensure to note the specific details provided about each dataset, such as the number of images and the categories they cover, as these details are crucial for understanding the datasets' scope and application.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are essential for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. The citations I will extract are:

- For the **CUB Dataset**:
  > Wah, C., Branson, S., Welinder, P., Perona, P., & Belongie, S. (2011). The Caltech-UCSD Birds-200-2011 Dataset.

- For the **Oxford-102 Dataset**:
  > Nilsback, M.-E., & Zisserman, A. (2008). Automated flower classification over a large number of classes. In 2008 Sixth Indian Conference on Computer Vision, Graphics & Image Processing (pp. 722-729). IEEE.

Finally, I will compile the extracted information into a structured format that clearly presents each dataset along with its citation. This will ensure that the datasets are well-documented and easily accessible for future reference or use in related research.
