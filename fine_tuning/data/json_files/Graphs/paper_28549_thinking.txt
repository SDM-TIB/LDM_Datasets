To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Leveraging blur information for plenoptic camera calibration" by Mathieu Labussière et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **experimental setup section**, the authors describe their experiments in detail. Here, they mention that they built four datasets with different focus distances for their experiments. Specifically, they refer to:

1. **R12-A**: Dataset for focus distance h = 450 mm.
2. **R12-B**: Dataset for focus distance h = 1000 mm.
3. **R12-C**: Dataset for focus distance h = ∞.
4. **R12-D**: Dataset for focus distance h = 1500 mm.

Each dataset consists of:
- White raw plenoptic images acquired at different apertures.
- Free-hand calibration target images acquired at various poses.
- Calibration targets acquired with controlled translation motion for quantitative evaluation.

Next, I will check the **results and discussion sections** to confirm the datasets' usage and any additional details that might be relevant for describing them.

After confirming the datasets, I will look into the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets or related works mentioned in the paper. This is crucial for providing proper attribution.

The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **R12-A, R12-B, R12-C, and R12-D**, the datasets are part of the research conducted by the authors themselves, and they mention that the datasets can be found in their public repository:
  > Labussière, Mathieu, Celine Teulière, Frédéric Bernardin, and Omar Ait-Aider. "Leveraging blur information for plenoptic camera calibration." *International Journal of Computer Vision*. Available at: https://github.com/comsee-research/plenoptic-datasets.

- For the **UPC-S dataset**, which is a simulated dataset, the citation is also part of the authors' work:
  > Labussière, Mathieu, Celine Teulière, Frédéric Bernardin, and Omar Ait-Aider. "Leveraging blur information for plenoptic camera calibration." *International Journal of Computer Vision*. Available at: https://github.com/comsee-research/plenoptic-datasets.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly describes each dataset, ensuring that the full citations are included for proper attribution. This will facilitate further analysis or use of the datasets in related research.
