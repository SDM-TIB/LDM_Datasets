To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Challenging Low Homophily in Social Recommendation" by Wei Jiang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on three public real-world datasets: **LastFM**, **Douban**, and **Yelp**. This is a strong indication that these datasets will be discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will look into **section 4.1 (Experimental Settings)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention:

1. **LastFM**: This dataset is used for social recommendation tasks. The paper states that it contains 92,834 users, 1,892 items, and 17,632 interactions, with a density of 0.28% and a homophily ratio of 0.1026.

2. **Douban**: Another dataset used in the experiments, which consists of 25,434 users, 39,586 items, and 198,397 interactions. The density is reported as 0.79% with a homophily ratio of 0.0425.

3. **Yelp**: The third dataset mentioned, which includes 16,239 users, 14,284 items, and 158,590 interactions, with a density of 0.08% and a homophily ratio of 0.0154.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. However, the paper does not provide specific citations for these datasets, as they are commonly used datasets in the field of social recommendation.

To summarize, I will compile the information about each dataset, including their names, descriptions, and any relevant statistics, while ensuring to note that the full citations are not provided in the paper. 

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for further processing or review.
