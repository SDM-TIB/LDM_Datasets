To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Medium. Permeation: SARS-COV-2 Painting Creation by Generative Model" by Yuan-Fu Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the work, and I will look for any references to datasets used for training or evaluation.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss their approach to generating artwork based on SARS-CoV-2 illustrations. They mention collecting over 300 viral illustrations from worldwide illustrators, which indicates a dataset used for training their Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). I will note this dataset and look for more details.

Next, I will examine the **methodology section**, particularly the parts where they describe the training process for their GAN and the Graph Neural Network (GNN). They mention using 196 paintings of the new coronavirus created by AI, which suggests another dataset. I will ensure to capture the context in which these datasets are used.

In the **results section**, the authors describe the output of their generative model, which is based on the datasets they collected. They also mention the use of a video art piece called "Gradual Change," which presents the generated paintings in a sequential manner. This indicates that the dataset of 196 paintings is significant for their final output.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper references various artists and their works, which may provide additional context for the datasets used. However, since the datasets are primarily based on the authors' own collection of illustrations and generated artworks, I will focus on documenting these.

The datasets I will extract are:

1. **Viral Illustrations Dataset**: This dataset consists of over 300 illustrations of the novel coronavirus collected from various artists worldwide. It is used to train the GAN to generate artwork in an Impressionist style.

2. **Generated Paintings Dataset**: This dataset includes 196 paintings created by the AI using the GAN, which are presented in a video format as part of the artwork "Gradual Change."

For the citations, since the datasets are based on the authors' own work and collections, I will note them as follows:

- For the **Viral Illustrations Dataset**, I will cite it as:
  > Yang, Y.-F., Fang, I.-K., Sun, M., & Hsu, S.-C. (2023). *Medium. Permeation: SARS-COV-2 Painting Creation by Generative Model*. [Dataset of over 300 viral illustrations collected from worldwide illustrators].

- For the **Generated Paintings Dataset**, I will cite it as:
  > Yang, Y.-F., Fang, I.-K., Sun, M., & Hsu, S.-C. (2023). *Medium. Permeation: SARS-COV-2 Painting Creation by Generative Model*. [Dataset of 196 paintings generated by AI].

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
