To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A closed-form approximation for pricing geometric Istanbul options" by Mohamed Amine Kacef and Kamal Boukhetala, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and numerical analysis sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of Monte-Carlo simulations for comparison, which suggests that there may be datasets involved in the simulations.

Next, I will examine the **numerical analysis section** closely, as it typically contains details about the datasets used for simulations. Here, the authors mention using Monte-Carlo simulations with a control variate method, but they do not explicitly name any datasets. Instead, they describe the parameters used in their simulations, such as the risk-free interest rate (r), volatility (Ïƒ), and various strike prices (K) and barriers (B).

Since the paper does not provide specific datasets or their citations, I will look for any references to datasets in the **References section**. However, it appears that the references primarily cite previous works related to the theoretical foundations and methods used in the paper rather than specific datasets.

Given that the paper does not explicitly mention any datasets or provide citations for them, I will conclude that there are no formal datasets to extract from this paper. Instead, the authors focus on theoretical models and numerical methods without referencing any external datasets.

In summary, I will document that no specific datasets were identified in the paper, and therefore, there are no citations to provide. This will be noted in my final output.
