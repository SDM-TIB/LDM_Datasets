To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Evaluating Logical Generalization in Graph Neural Networks" by Koustuv Sinha et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract introduces a benchmark suite called **GraphLog**, which is a key focus of the paper. This indicates that there is a dataset involved.

Next, I will look into **section 3 (GraphLog)**, where the authors describe the dataset in detail. Here, they mention that GraphLog consists of **57 distinct logical domains** and provides a comprehensive overview of how the dataset is generated, including the number of graphs and the structure of the knowledge graphs.

In **section 3.4 (Summary of the GraphLog Dataset)**, the authors provide aggregate statistics about the dataset, confirming that it includes **5000 graphs per world** for training, validation, and testing. This section is crucial as it outlines the dataset's characteristics and its intended use for evaluating GNNs.

I will also check the **References section** to find any citations related to the datasets mentioned. The paper does not reference external datasets but focuses on the proposed GraphLog dataset. Therefore, I will note that the citation for the GraphLog dataset is as follows:

- For **GraphLog**, the citation is:
  > Koustuv Sinha, Shagun Sodhani, Joelle Pineau, and William L. Hamilton. *Evaluating Logical Generalization in Graph Neural Networks*. In Proceedings of the Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS), 2023.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the GraphLog dataset as it is the primary dataset discussed in the paper. This will ensure that all relevant details are captured for future reference or analysis.
