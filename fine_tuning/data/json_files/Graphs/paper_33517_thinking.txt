To extract datasets from the research paper titled "GLISP: A Scalable GNN Learning System by Exploiting Inherent Structural Properties of Graphs" by Zhongshu Zhu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and evaluation sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that extensive experiments were conducted, which suggests that datasets were used. The introduction provides context about the challenges faced in GNNs and mentions specific datasets, indicating that I should look for their names and details.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically looking for any tables or lists that summarize the datasets used. In this case, I find a table (Table I) that lists the statistics of the datasets used in the experiments, which includes:

1. **OGBN-Products**: This dataset contains 2,449,029 vertices and 10,458,278,953 edges.
2. **WikiKG90Mv2**: This dataset has 61,859,140 vertices and 601,062,811 edges.
3. **Twitter-2010**: This dataset consists of 91,230,610 vertices and 1,468,365,181 edges.
4. **OGBN-Paper**: This dataset includes 41,652,230 vertices and 48,959,724,102 edges.
5. **RelNet**: An internal dataset with 111,059,956 vertices and 10,458,278,953 edges.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The paper references the OGBN datasets, which are part of the Open Graph Benchmark. The citations for these datasets are typically found in the corresponding papers or the official OGB website.

For the datasets mentioned, I will compile the following citations:

- **OGBN-Products**:

- **WikiKG90Mv2**:

- **Twitter-2010**:
  > Twitter-2010 dataset. Available at: https://law.di.unimi.it/webdata/twitter-2010/

- **OGBN-Paper**:

- **RelNet**: Since this is an internal dataset, it may not have a formal citation available. I will note that it is an internal dataset used by the authors.

Now, I will summarize the datasets and their citations in a structured format for clarity and future reference. This will ensure that I have all the necessary information to present the datasets effectively.
