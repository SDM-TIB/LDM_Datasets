To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Uncertainty Aware Trader-Company Method: Interpretable Stock Price Prediction Capturing Uncertainty" by Yugo Fujimoto et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted a comprehensive evaluation based on synthetic and real market datasets, which suggests that there are specific datasets used in their research.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors describe their methodology and the datasets used. In this section, they mention two types of datasets:

1. **Synthetic Datasets**: The authors describe the creation of synthetic datasets for their experiments, specifically mentioning a simple nonlinear case and a dataset shift case. However, they do not provide a formal citation for these synthetic datasets since they are generated by the authors for the purpose of the study.

2. **Real Market Datasets**: The authors specify that they used the **TOPIX100 index** for their experiments. They provide details about the data used, including the time period and the nature of the data (daily and hourly trading). 

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper does not provide a formal citation for the synthetic datasets, as they are original to the study. However, for the real market dataset, the authors refer to the TOPIX100 index, which is a well-known financial index.

The citation for the TOPIX100 index is not explicitly provided in the paper, but I can reference it as follows:
- **TOPIX100 Index**: The TOPIX100 index is a market capitalization-weighted index of large-cap Japanese stocks, consisting of the top 100 stocks with particularly high market capitalization and liquidity.

Since the authors did not provide a formal citation for the TOPIX100 index in the references, I will note that it is a widely recognized index in financial literature.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **Synthetic Datasets**: Original datasets created by the authors for the purpose of this study.
2. **TOPIX100 Index**: A market capitalization-weighted index of large-cap Japanese stocks.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing.
