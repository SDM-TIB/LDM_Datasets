To extract datasets from the research paper titled "OPTIMAL MIX AMONG PAYGO, EET AND INDIVIDUAL SAVINGS" by Lin He et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. These sections often provide a summary of the research and may mention any datasets used for analysis. In this case, the abstract discusses the transformation of pension systems and the evaluation of different schemes, which may imply the use of datasets related to pension systems.

Next, I will examine the **methodology** and **experiments** sections, as these typically detail the datasets used for analysis. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, descriptions, and any relevant statistics or characteristics. 

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors reference various datasets related to pension systems, demographic data, and economic indicators. However, they do not provide specific dataset names or citations directly in the text. Therefore, I will need to look at the **references section** to identify any datasets that may have been cited in previous works.

In the references, I will look for papers or datasets that are commonly used in pension research. For example, if the authors reference datasets from government sources or well-known studies, I will note these down. 

After identifying the datasets, I will ensure to write down the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and for others to locate the datasets used in the research.

For example, if I find that the authors used the "World Bank Pension Database," I would document it as follows:

- **World Bank Pension Database**: 
  > World Bank. *World Bank Pension Database*. Available at: [URL or DOI if available].

If they referenced specific studies or datasets, I would format them similarly, ensuring to include all necessary details such as authors, title, publication year, and where to access the dataset.

Finally, I will compile all the identified datasets along with their citations into a structured format for easy reference.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets used in the research paper, providing full citations for each to maintain academic integrity.
