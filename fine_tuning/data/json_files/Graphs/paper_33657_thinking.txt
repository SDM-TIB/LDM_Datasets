To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Personalized Privacy: User-Governed Data Contribution for Federated Recommendation" by Wei Yuan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that extensive experiments were conducted on two public datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed present in the paper. I will look for the names of these datasets.

Next, I will examine **section 4.1 (Settings)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention two datasets:

1. **Gowalla**: This dataset is described as a location-based social network dataset consisting of users and their locations by checking in. The authors provide statistics about the dataset, including the number of users, items, and interactions.

2. **Yelp2018**: This dataset is a business review dataset that includes customers, restaurants, and the associated reviews given by customers to these restaurants. Similar to Gowalla, the authors provide statistics about this dataset as well.

To ensure I have the correct full citations for these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper. The authors reference the datasets as follows:

- For **Gowalla**, the citation is:
  > Dawen Liang, Laurent Charlin, James McInerney, and David M Blei. *Modeling user exposure in recommendation*. In Proceedings of the 25th International Conference on World Wide Web (WWW), pages 951â€“961, 2016.

- For **Yelp2018**, the citation is:
  > Yelp Dataset Challenge. *Yelp Dataset Challenge*. Available at: https://www.yelp.com/dataset/challenge.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This will include the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all necessary details are captured accurately.
