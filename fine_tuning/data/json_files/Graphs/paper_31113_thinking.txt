To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Simple yet Effective Gradient-Free Graph Convolutional Networks" by Yulin Zhu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on various tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved. However, it does not specify any dataset names. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they explicitly mention four commonly used citation networks: **Cora**, **Cora-ML**, **Citeseer**, and **PubMed**. Each of these datasets represents published papers as nodes and citations as edges, which is crucial information for understanding their context.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The authors reference a paper by Sen et al. (2008) that provides details about these datasets. The citation is as follows:

- For **Cora, Cora-ML, Citeseer, and PubMed**, the citation is:
  > Prithviraj Sen, Galileo Namata, Mustafa Bilgic, Lise Getoor, Brian Galligher, and Tina Eliassi-Rad. *Collective classification in network data*. AI magazine, 29(3):93â€“93, 2008.

Having gathered this information, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **Cora**: A citation network dataset where nodes represent papers and edges represent citations.
2. **Cora-ML**: A variant of the Cora dataset that includes additional features.
3. **Citeseer**: Another citation network dataset similar to Cora.
4. **PubMed**: A dataset consisting of scientific publications in the biomedical domain.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names and their corresponding citations, ensuring that the information is clear and ready for further processing or review.
