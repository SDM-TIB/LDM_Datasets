To extract datasets from the research paper titled "LAMBDANET: Probabilistic Type Inference Using Graph Neural Networks" by Jiayi Wei et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions and may mention datasets used for evaluation. 

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this paper, the authors mention that they evaluated their model on **300 popular TypeScript projects from GitHub**. This indicates that the dataset consists of real-world codebases, which is crucial for understanding the context of their experiments.

In the **evaluation section**, the authors provide details about the dataset, stating that it contains TypeScript projects with varying lines of code and user-defined types. They also mention that they used **60 projects for testing, 40 for validation, and the remainder for training**. This information is essential for understanding the dataset's composition.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. In this case, the dataset is derived from GitHub projects, so I will need to cite the source of the dataset appropriately. Since the authors do not provide a specific citation for the dataset, I will reference the GitHub repository where the projects can be found.

The citation for the dataset can be structured as follows:
> Wei, J., Goyal, M., Durrett, G., & Dillig, I. (2020). *LAMBDANET: Probabilistic Type Inference Using Graph Neural Networks*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR). Available at: https://github.com/MrVPlusOne/LambdaNet

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and citation. This will ensure that I have a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
