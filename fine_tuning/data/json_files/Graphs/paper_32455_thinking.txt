To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Unsupervised Adaptation of Polyp Segmentation Models via Coarse-to-Fine Self-Supervision" by Jiexiang Wang and Chaoqi Chen, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **experiments section**, specifically section 3.1, the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for evaluation. They state that they evaluated their method on three public datasets and one in-house dataset. The datasets mentioned are:

1. **ClinicDB**: This dataset contains 612 Standard Definition (SD) frames from 31 sequences.
2. **ETIS-LARIB**: This dataset consists of 196 High Definition (HD) frames from 34 sequences.
3. **Kvasir-SEG**: This dataset includes 1000 polyp frames with various resolutions.
4. **In-house dataset**: Collected from a local hospital, this dataset contains 5175 frames with polyp annotations sketched by two experienced gastroenterologists.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **ClinicDB**, the citation is:
  > Silva, J., Histace, A., Romain, O., Dray, X., Granado, B. (2014). Toward embedded detection of polyps in WCE images for early diagnosis of colorectal cancer. *International Journal of Computer Assisted Radiology and Surgery*, 9(2), 283–293.

- For **ETIS-LARIB**, the citation is:
  > Bernal, J., Sánchez, F.J., Fernández-Esparrach, G., Gil, D., Rodríguez, C., Vilarinho, F. (2015). Wm-dova maps for accurate polyp highlighting in colonoscopy: Validation vs. saliency maps from physicians. *Computerized Medical Imaging and Graphics*, 43, 99–111.

- For **Kvasir-SEG**, the citation is:
  > Jha, D., Smedsrud, P.H., Riegler, M.A., Halvorsen, P., Lange, T.d., Johansen, D., Johansen, H.D. (2020). Kvasir-seg: A segmented polyp dataset. In *International Conference on Multimedia Modeling* (pp. 451–462). Springer.

- The **in-house dataset** does not have a formal citation as it is collected from a local hospital, but it is important to note its origin and the annotation process.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and attributed correctly. This structured approach will ensure that I capture all relevant information about the datasets used in the research paper.
