To extract datasets from the research paper titled "StreamYOLO: Real-time Object Detection for Streaming Perception" by Jinrong Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on the **Argoverse-HD dataset**, which indicates that this dataset is likely important for their research.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **introduction**. The authors discuss the need for real-time object detection in streaming perception, and they reference the **Argoverse-HD dataset** as a key dataset used for their experiments.

In the **experiments section**, I will look for detailed descriptions of the datasets used. The authors explicitly state that they conducted experiments on the **Argoverse-HD dataset**. I will note the details provided about this dataset, such as its characteristics, the number of videos, and the types of annotations available.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the **Argoverse-HD dataset**. The citation is as follows:
> M.-F. Chang, J. Lambert, P. Sangkloy, J. Singh, S. Bak, A. Hartnett, D. Wang, P. Carr, S. Lucey, D. Ramanan et al. "Argoverse: 3D tracking and forecasting with rich maps." In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2019, pp. 8748â€“8757.

Since the paper primarily focuses on the **Argoverse-HD dataset**, I will ensure to include this dataset in my final output.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring that the full citation is included. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the dataset used in the research paper, ready for downstream processing or review.
