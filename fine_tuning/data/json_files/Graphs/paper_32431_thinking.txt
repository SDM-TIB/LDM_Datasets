To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Blur aware metric depth estimation with multi-focus plenoptic cameras" by Mathieu Labussière et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions the introduction of a new dataset for validating the proposed depth estimation framework, which indicates that there are datasets to extract. The introduction may provide additional context or names of the datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **experiments**. In this paper, the authors specifically mention datasets in section 7.3, where they describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they introduce several datasets:

1. **R12-A, B, C**: These datasets correspond to different focus distances (450 mm, 1000 mm, and infinity, respectively) and are used for relative depth evaluation. The authors refer to previous work (Labussière et al., 2020) for these datasets.

2. **R12-E**: This dataset corresponds to a new focus distance of 2133 mm and includes various real-world 3D scenes with metric ground truth acquired with a 3D lidar scanner.

3. **R12-ES**: A simulated dataset built upon their own simulator based on ray tracing, which generates images with known absolute positions.

4. **R12-ELP20**: This dataset includes several real-world scenes with metric ground truth acquired with a lidar scanner, containing various objects and scenes.

After identifying these datasets, I will then refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. The citations for the datasets are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The citations I will extract include:

- For **R12-A, B, C**:

- For **R12-E** and **R12-ELP20**:

- For **R12-ES**:

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including their names, descriptions, and citations, into a structured format that can be easily reviewed or processed further. This systematic approach ensures that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.
