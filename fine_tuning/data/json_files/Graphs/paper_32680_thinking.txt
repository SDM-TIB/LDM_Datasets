To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Contrastive Learning for Enhancing Robust Scene Transfer in Vision-based Agile Flight" by Jiaxu Xing et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract discusses the performance of the proposed method on various tasks, which may indicate the use of specific datasets. The introduction may provide further context or mention datasets directly.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors describe their approach and the environments used for training the vision encoder. They mention that images for training were collected from four simulation environments, which suggests that these environments may be treated as datasets.

In the **experiments section**, I will pay close attention to any references to specific datasets used for evaluation or training. The authors mention collecting **12,000 images** from various environments, including a simple warehouse scene, a digital twin of the testing environment, an empty scene, and a realistic digital twin rendered using Blender. These environments can be considered datasets for the purpose of their experiments.

Now, I will compile the information about the datasets:

1. **Simulated Warehouse Scene**: This dataset consists of images collected from a simple warehouse environment used for training the vision encoder.

2. **Digital Twin of Testing Environment**: This dataset includes images from a digital twin that simulates the real-world testing environment.

3. **Empty Scene**: This dataset is composed of images from an empty environment, which serves as another training scenario.

4. **Realistic Digital Twin Rendered Using Blender**: This dataset consists of images rendered using Blender to create a realistic simulation of the environment.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. However, since the datasets in this paper are primarily derived from simulation environments created by the authors, they may not have formal citations like publicly available datasets.

After gathering all this information, I will ensure that I document each dataset clearly, including its name, description, and any relevant details about how it was used in the research.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for easy reference, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its description and context within the research paper.
