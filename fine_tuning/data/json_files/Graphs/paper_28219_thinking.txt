To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Self-supervised Representation Learning for Trip Recommendation" by Qiang Gao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to gather initial insights about the datasets used. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their method on **four real-world datasets**, which indicates that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **evaluation section** where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they explicitly list the datasets as follows:

1. **Toronto Dataset**: This dataset is derived from Flickr and contains user-generated trip data, specifically focusing on the city of Toronto. The authors mention that it has been widely used in prior studies.

2. **Osaka Dataset**: Similar to the Toronto dataset, this dataset is also sourced from Flickr and pertains to user trips in Osaka. It is noted for its relevance in trip recommendation research.

3. **Glasgow Dataset**: This dataset, again from Flickr, includes trip data for the city of Glasgow, contributing to the evaluation of the proposed method.

4. **Edinburgh Dataset**: The final dataset mentioned is for Edinburgh, also sourced from Flickr, and is included in the experiments to assess the performance of the SelfTrip framework.

In the **results section**, the authors provide descriptive statistics for each dataset, confirming their use in the experiments. This reinforces the identification of these datasets as critical components of their research.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **Toronto Dataset**, the citation is:

- For the **Osaka Dataset**, the citation is:

- For the **Glasgow Dataset**, the citation is:

- For the **Edinburgh Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Lim, K. H.; Chan, J.; Leckie, C.; and Karunasekera, S. (2015). Personalized tour recommendation based on user interests and points of interest visit durations. In IJCAI.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented and properly cited.
