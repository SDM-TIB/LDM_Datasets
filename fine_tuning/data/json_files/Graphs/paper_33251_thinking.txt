To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Spectral Temporal Contrastive Learning" by Sacha Morin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a general overview of the research focus but may not specify datasets. The introduction may contain references to datasets used in prior work or in the context of the current study.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly the **Appendix** where the authors describe their experimental setup. Here, they mention two specific datasets:

1. **3D Teapot Model Dataset**: This dataset consists of images of a 3D Teapot model rotated over 400 different angles. The downstream task involves predicting the Teapot angle pose (cos θ, sin θ).

2. **Grid World Environment Dataset**: This dataset is based on images generated by a Grid World environment, where the task is to predict the (x, y) coordinates of an agent. The authors collected random trajectories with random uniform policies in this environment.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. However, in this case, the datasets are described in the context of the experiments rather than being formally published datasets with citations. The 3D Teapot model dataset is referenced from a work by Weinberger et al. (2004), which I will need to cite properly.

The citation for the 3D Teapot model dataset is:
> Kilian Q. Weinberger, Fei Sha, and Lawrence K. Saul. *Learning a kernel matrix for nonlinear dimensionality reduction*. In Proceedings ICML, page 106, 2004.

Since the Grid World dataset is generated for the purpose of this research and does not have a formal citation, I will note that it is a custom dataset created by the authors.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citation for the 3D Teapot model dataset and a description for the Grid World dataset. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.
