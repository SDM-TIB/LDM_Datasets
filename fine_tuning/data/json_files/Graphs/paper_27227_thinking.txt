To extract datasets from the research paper titled "General Hannan and Quinn Criterion for Common Time Series" by Kare Kamila, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly referenced. The abstract mentions "Monte-Carlo experiments and an illustrative example on the CAC 40 index," which suggests that there may be datasets related to these experiments.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this section, the author discusses "numerical experiments" and mentions three different Data Generating Processes (DGPs) used for testing the model selection criteria. The DGPs are:

1. **DGP I**: \(X_t = 0.5 X_{t-1} + 0.2 X_{t-2} + \xi_t\)
2. **DGP II**: \(X_t = 0.1(X_{t-1} + X_{t-2} + ... + X_{t-6}) + \xi_t\)
3. **DGP III**: \(X_t = 0.2 + 0.4 X_{t-2} + \xi_t\)

These DGPs are not traditional datasets but rather mathematical models used to generate synthetic data for the experiments. However, they are crucial for understanding the context of the experiments.

Additionally, the paper mentions the **CAC 40 index** as a real-world dataset used for analysis. I will need to find the full citation for this dataset as it is a well-known financial index.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the CAC 40 index. The paper does not provide a specific citation for the dataset itself, but it is commonly referenced in financial literature. A typical citation for the CAC 40 index might look like this:

- **CAC 40 Index**: 
  > Euronext. *CAC 40 Index*. Available at: [https://www.euronext.com/en/products/indices/FR0003500008-XPAR](https://www.euronext.com/en/products/indices/FR0003500008-XPAR).

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets and their citations as follows:

1. **DGP I**: A synthetic dataset generated by the model \(X_t = 0.5 X_{t-1} + 0.2 X_{t-2} + \xi_t\).
2. **DGP II**: A synthetic dataset generated by the model \(X_t = 0.1(X_{t-1} + X_{t-2} + ... + X_{t-6}) + \xi_t\).
3. **DGP III**: A synthetic dataset generated by the model \(X_t = 0.2 + 0.4 X_{t-2} + \xi_t\).
4. **CAC 40 Index**: 
   > Euronext. *CAC 40 Index*. Available at: [https://www.euronext.com/en/products/indices/FR0003500008-XPAR](https://www.euronext.com/en/products/indices/FR0003500008-XPAR).

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
