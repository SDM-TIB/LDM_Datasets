To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MoNet: Motion-based Point Cloud Prediction Network" by Fan Lu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the proposed method is evaluated on "two large scale outdoor LiDAR datasets," indicating that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention:

1. **KITTI Odometry Dataset**: This dataset contains 11 sequences (00-11) with ground truth data. The authors specify that they use sequences 00 to 05 for training, 06 to 07 for validation, and 08 to 10 for testing.

2. **Argoverse Dataset**: The authors utilize the 3D tracking branch of this dataset and follow the default splits for training, validation, and testing.

In the **experiments section**, the authors confirm that they performed extensive experiments on these two datasets, which reinforces their relevance to the study.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **KITTI Odometry Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Andreas Geiger, Philip Lenz, and Raquel Urtasun. *Are we ready for autonomous driving? The KITTI vision benchmark suite*. In 2012 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 3354–3361. IEEE, 2012.

- For the **Argoverse Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Ming-Fang Chang, John Lambert, Patsorn Sangkloy, Jagjeet Singh, Slawomir Bak, Andrew Hartnett, De Wang, Peter Carr, Simon Lucey, Deva Ramanan, et al. *Argoverse: 3D tracking and forecasting with rich maps*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 8748–8757, 2019.

With this information, I can now summarize the datasets and their citations clearly. 

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
