To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Slot Induction via Pre-trained Language Model Probing and Multi-level Contrastive Learning" by Hoang H. Nguyen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method on "two NLU benchmark datasets," which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they state that they evaluate their work on the **ATIS** and **SNIPS** datasets. I will look for detailed descriptions of these datasets, including their characteristics and any relevant statistics.

In **Table 1**, the authors provide a summary of the datasets, including the number of intents, slots, and samples for both datasets. Here’s what I find:

1. **ATIS Dataset**: 
   - Number of Intents: 14
   - Number of Slots: 68
   - Train Samples: 3811
   - Validation Samples: 414
   - Test Samples: 750
   - Average Train Sentence Length: 11.67
   - Average Validation Sentence Length: 11.82
   - Average Test Sentence Length: 10.68

2. **SNIPS Dataset**: 
   - Number of Intents: 5
   - Number of Slots: 31
   - Train Samples: 9356
   - Validation Samples: 500
   - Test Samples: 501
   - Average Train Sentence Length: 8.65
   - Average Validation Sentence Length: 8.72
   - Average Test Sentence Length: 8.71

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The authors reference the original papers for both datasets:

- For the **ATIS dataset**, the citation is:
  > Tur, G., Hakkani-Tür, D., & Heck, L. (2010). What is left to be understood in ATIS? In *2010 IEEE Spoken Language Technology Workshop* (pp. 19-24). IEEE.

- For the **SNIPS dataset**, the citation is:
  > Coucke, A., Saade, A., Ball, A., Bluche, T., Caulier, A., Leroy, D., Doumouro, C., Gisselbrecht, T., Caltagirone, F., Lavril, T., et al. (2018). Snips voice platform: an embedded spoken language understanding system for private-by-design voice interfaces. *arXiv preprint arXiv:1805.10190*.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use.

In summary, I have extracted the following datasets from the paper:

1. **ATIS Dataset**
   - Citation: Tur, G., Hakkani-Tür, D., & Heck, L. (2010). What is left to be understood in ATIS? In *2010 IEEE Spoken Language Technology Workshop* (pp. 19-24). IEEE.

2. **SNIPS Dataset**
   - Citation: Coucke, A., Saade, A., Ball, A., Bluche, T., Caulier, A., Leroy, D., Doumouro, C., Gisselbrecht, T., Caltagirone, F., Lavril, T., et al. (2018). Snips voice platform: an embedded spoken language understanding system for private-by-design voice interfaces. *arXiv preprint arXiv:1805.10190*.

With this information, I am ready to format the dataset entries as needed for downstream processing.
