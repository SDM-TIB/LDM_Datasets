To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Canonical Tensor Decomposition for Knowledge Base Completion" by TimothÃ©e Lacroix et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their methods on several datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will focus on **section 6 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. They mention five common benchmark datasets for link prediction in knowledge bases:

1. **WN18**: This dataset is derived from the WordNet database and contains 41,000 entities and 18 predicates. The training set has 5,000 triples, the validation set has 5,000 triples, and the test set has 141,000 triples.

2. **WN18RR**: A modified version of WN18, this dataset has 41,000 entities and 11 predicates, with 3,000 training triples, 3,000 validation triples, and 87,000 test triples.

3. **FB15K**: This dataset is a subset of Freebase with 15,000 entities and 1,000 predicates. It includes 60,000 training triples, 5,000 validation triples, and 50,000 test triples.

4. **FB15K-237**: A modified version of FB15K, this dataset has 15,000 entities and 237 predicates, with 20,000 training triples, 5,000 validation triples, and 18,000 test triples.

5. **YAGO3-10**: This dataset contains 123,000 entities and 37 predicates, with 500,000 training triples, 5,000 validation triples, and 272,000 test triples.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:

- For **WN18**, the citation is:

- For **WN18RR**, the citation is:

- For **FB15K**, the citation is:

- For **FB15K-237**, the citation is:
  > Dettmers, T., Minervini, P., Stenetorp, P., & Riedel, S. (2017). Convolutional 2D knowledge graph embeddings. arXiv preprint arXiv:1707.01476.

- For **YAGO3-10**, the citation is:
  > Dettmers, T., Minervini, P., Stenetorp, P., & Riedel, S. (2017). Convolutional 2D knowledge graph embeddings. arXiv preprint arXiv:1707.01476.

Now that I have gathered the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
