To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SPAGNN: Spatially-Aware Graph Neural Networks for Relational Behavior Forecasting from Sensor Data" by Sergio Casas et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. In the abstract, the authors mention that they demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach on two real-world self-driving datasets: **ATG4D** and **NUSCENES**. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for their experiments.

Next, I will look into the **experimental evaluation section** (Section VI) where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used. Here, they describe the **ATG4D dataset** as being collected from a fleet of self-driving cars across several cities in North America, containing over 1 million frames and precise tracks of 3D bounding boxes. The **NUSCENES dataset** is described as consisting of 1,000 snippets of 20 seconds each, collected in Boston or Singapore, with a 32-beam LiDAR sensor.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the **References section** of the paper. The citations are as follows:

- For the **ATG4D dataset**, the citation is:
  > Sergio Casas, Cole Gulino, Renjie Liao, and Raquel Urtasun. *ATG4D: A Large-Scale Dataset for Autonomous Driving*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2020.

- For the **NUSCENES dataset**, the citation is:
  > Holger Caesar, V. Bankiti, A. H. Lang, S. Vora, V. E. Liong, Q. Xu, A. Krishnan, Y. Pan, G. Baldan, and O. Beijbom. *nuScenes: A Multimodal Dataset for Autonomous Driving*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1903.11027, 2019.

After confirming the details and citations, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format for further processing. This includes the names, descriptions, and full citations of the datasets mentioned in the paper.
