To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Self-supervised Contrastive Video-Speech Representation Learning for Ultrasound" by Jianbo Jiao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on **multi-modal fetal ultrasound video and audio**, which suggests that there is a dataset involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors discuss the challenges of manual annotations in medical imaging and the need for self-supervised learning from unlabelled data. They mention using ultrasound video and corresponding narrative speech audio, which implies that these two modalities form the basis of their dataset.

In the **experiments section**, specifically **section 3.1 (Data and Experimental Settings)**, the authors provide detailed information about the dataset they used. They mention that the data is from a **routine clinical fetal ultrasound dataset**, which includes scanned video and corresponding real-time speech, as well as eye-gaze data from sonographers. They specify that there are **81 scans** with speech data, and each video scan consists of approximately **55,000 frames**.

To ensure I have the correct citation for the dataset, I will check the **References section**. The authors reference the dataset with the following note:
> "UK Research Ethics Committee Reference 18/WS/0051."

However, they do not provide a full citation for the dataset itself in the references. Since this is a clinical dataset, it may not have a formal citation like publicly available datasets. Therefore, I will note it as a clinical dataset without a specific citation.

Now, I will summarize the findings:

1. **Fetal Ultrasound Dataset**: This dataset consists of ultrasound video and corresponding narrative speech audio, collected from 81 scans. Each video scan contains about 55,000 frames, and the dataset is used for self-supervised learning tasks.

Since the dataset does not have a formal citation, I will document it as follows:

- **Dataset Name**: Fetal Ultrasound Dataset
- **Description**: A clinical dataset containing ultrasound video and corresponding narrative speech audio from 81 scans, used for self-supervised representation learning.
- **Citation**: Not formally cited; referenced under UK Research Ethics Committee Reference 18/WS/0051.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format for further processing or review.
