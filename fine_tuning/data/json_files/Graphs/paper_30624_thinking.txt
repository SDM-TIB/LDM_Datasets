To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On Negative Sampling for Contrastive Audio-Text Retrieval" by Huang Xie et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions exploring negative sampling strategies in the context of audio-text retrieval, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors discuss their experimental setup. Here, they mention using the **Clotho v2 dataset** for their experiments. I will extract the details provided about this dataset:

1. **Clotho v2 Dataset**: The paper describes this dataset as consisting of 5,929 audio clips, each with five human-written captions, totaling 29,645 captions. The clips last between 15 to 30 seconds, and the dataset is divided into development, validation, and evaluation splits.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Clotho v2 dataset. The citation provided in the references is:

- For **Clotho v2 Dataset**:
  > K. Drossos, S. Lipping, and T. Virtanen. *Clotho: an Audio Captioning Dataset*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP), pages 736â€“740, 2020.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets explicitly, I will conclude my extraction here.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry for the Clotho v2 dataset, ensuring that I include the full citation as required. This will be ready for further processing or review.
