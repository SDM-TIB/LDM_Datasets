To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Freshness or Accuracy, Why Not Both? Addressing Delayed Feedback via Dynamic Graph Neural Networks" by Xiaolin Zheng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. In the abstract, the authors mention conducting experiments on **three industry datasets**, which indicates that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section IV) where the authors explicitly state the datasets used for their experiments. They mention three datasets: **TENCENT**, **CRITEO2**, and **CIKM**. I will look for detailed descriptions of these datasets, including their characteristics and any relevant statistics.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide a brief overview of each dataset:
1. **TENCENT**: An industry dataset for social advertising competition, which includes 14 days of click and conversion logs.
2. **CRITEO2**: A newly-released dataset representing Criteo live traffic data over 90 days, with additional feature names for graph construction.
3. **CIKM**: A competition dataset used in CIKM 2019 Ecomm AI, providing user behavior data in Taobao over 14 days.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. However, it appears that the datasets themselves are not associated with specific papers in the references, as they are industry datasets. Therefore, I will document them based on the information provided in the paper.

The citations for the datasets will be as follows:
- **TENCENT Dataset**: No specific citation is provided, but it is described as an industry dataset for social advertising competition.
- **CRITEO2 Dataset**: No specific citation is provided, but it is described as a dataset for sponsored search traffic from Criteo.
- **CIKM Dataset**: No specific citation is provided, but it is described as a competition dataset used in CIKM 2019 Ecomm AI.

Since these datasets are industry datasets and may not have formal citations, I will note that they are referenced as part of the experimental setup in the paper.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and any relevant statistics, ensuring that I clearly indicate the lack of formal citations for these industry datasets.
