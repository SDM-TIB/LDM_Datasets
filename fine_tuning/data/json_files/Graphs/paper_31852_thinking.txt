To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Visual Information Extraction in the Wild: Practical Dataset and End-to-end Solution" by Jianfeng Kuang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors propose a large-scale dataset for Visual Information Extraction (VIE) and mention existing datasets like SROIE and EPHOIE. This suggests that I should look for detailed descriptions of these datasets in the paper.

Next, I will examine **section 3 (POIE Dataset)**, where the authors describe their proposed dataset, the "Products for OCR and Information Extraction (POIE)." This section provides crucial information about the dataset, including its characteristics, number of images, and types of entities. The authors state that POIE consists of 3,000 images with 111,155 text instances, which is significant for understanding its scale and application.

In **section 2.1 (VIE Datasets)**, the authors discuss existing datasets, specifically mentioning:

1. **SROIE**: This dataset is described as the most widely used for VIE, consisting of scanned receipts in English. The authors provide a reference to the original paper that introduced SROIE.

2. **EPHOIE**: This dataset is noted for Chinese document VIE, which is not suitable for English VIE assessments. The authors also provide a reference for this dataset.

I will now gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper from the **References section**:

- For **SROIE**, the citation is:
  > Huang, Z., Chen, K., He, J., Bai, X., Karatzas, D., Lu, S. (2019). *ICDAR2019 competition on scanned receipt ocr and information extraction*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition (ICDAR), pp. 1516–1520.

- For **EPHOIE**, the citation is:
  > Wang, J., Liu, C., Jin, L., Tang, G., Zhang, J., Zhang, S., Wang, Q., Wu, Y., Cai, M. (2021). *Towards robust visual information extraction in real world: new dataset and novel solution*. In Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, vol. 35, pp. 2738–2745.

- For **POIE**, since it is a new dataset proposed by the authors, I will cite the paper itself:
  > Kuang, J., Hua, W., Liang, D., Yang, M., Jiang, D., Ren, B., Bai, X. (2023). *Visual Information Extraction in the Wild: Practical Dataset and End-to-end Solution*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition (ICDAR).

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets discussed in the paper, which is essential for any further analysis or application of the research findings.
