To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Students’ interest in knowledge acquisition in Artificial Intelligence" by Manuela-Andreea Petrescu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, results, and conclusion sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, but it does not mention any datasets directly. I will need to look deeper into the methodology and results sections for any data collection details.

In the **methodology section**, the authors describe conducting a survey among 58 undergraduate students. This survey is the primary source of data for the study, but it does not refer to an external dataset; rather, it is an original dataset created from the survey responses. The authors mention that the survey included both closed and open questions, which were analyzed thematically.

Next, I will check the **results section** to see how the data collected from the survey is presented. The results summarize students' expectations and interests in AI, but again, this is based on the original data collected through the survey rather than an external dataset.

Since the paper does not reference any pre-existing datasets or publicly available datasets, I will note that the only dataset involved is the one generated from the survey responses of the students. 

Now, I will look at the **references section** to ensure that I have captured any relevant citations. However, since the paper primarily discusses the authors' own survey data, there are no external datasets to cite.

In conclusion, I will document the dataset as follows:

- **Dataset Name**: Student Survey on AI Interest
- **Description**: A dataset comprising responses from 58 undergraduate students enrolled in a Computer Science specialization, focusing on their expectations and interests in the field of Artificial Intelligence.
- **Citation**: Petrescu, M.-A., Popa, E.-L., & Mihoc, T.-D. (2023). Students’ interest in knowledge acquisition in Artificial Intelligence. *Procedia Computer Science*, 00, 000–000. Available online at www.sciencedirect.com.

This dataset is unique to this study and does not have an external citation since it is not derived from previously published data. I will compile this information into a structured format for further use.
