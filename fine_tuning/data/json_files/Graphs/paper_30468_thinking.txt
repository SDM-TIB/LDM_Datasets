To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Graph Attention Networks Unveil Determinants of Intra- and Inter-city Health Disparity" by Chenyue Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the study uses large-scale anonymized mobility data and population activity data provided by Spectus and SafeGraph, which indicates that these are key datasets for the research.

Next, I will examine the **data collection and data processing** section, where the authors describe the specific datasets used. They mention that public health data related to obesity, diabetes, cancer, and heart disease were collected from the **Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)**. This dataset includes various health measures at different geographic levels, which is crucial for the analysis.

Additionally, I will look for any other datasets mentioned in the **methodology** and **results** sections. The authors refer to mobility data from **Spectus** and **SafeGraph**, which are used to derive features related to population activity and mobility. They also mention using **American Community Survey** data for socio-demographic features.

Now, I will compile the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper:

1. **Public Health Data**:
   - Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. *Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System*. Retrieved from https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/index.html

2. **Mobility Data**:
   - Spectus. Data provided by Spectus, a location intelligence company that collects anonymized mobility data from mobile devices.
   - SafeGraph. Data provided by SafeGraph, which includes information on points of interest (POI) and population activity.

3. **Socio-Demographic Data**:
   - United States Census Bureau. *American Community Survey*. Retrieved from https://data.census.gov/cedsci/

After gathering this information, I will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets and their respective citations. This will allow me to create a structured output that reflects the datasets used in the research, ensuring that all citations are complete and properly formatted for future reference or analysis.
