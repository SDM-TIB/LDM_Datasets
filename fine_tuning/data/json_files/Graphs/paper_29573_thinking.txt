To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MultiBiSage: A Web-Scale Recommendation System Using Multiple Bipartite Graphs at Pinterest" by Saket Gurukar et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the datasets used in the study. The abstract mentions that the authors trained their model on "six bipartite graphs," which indicates that multiple datasets are involved.

Next, I will look into **section 4.1 (Experiments)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the datasets. Here, they describe the six bipartite graphs curated from Pinterest logs, including their statistics such as the number of entities and edges. The specific bipartite graphs mentioned are:

1. **Pin-Board Graph**: This graph captures the relationship between pins and boards, containing over 1.9 billion edges.
2. **User-Product Graph**: This graph represents interactions between users and products, with over 40 million edges.
3. **User-Ad Graph**: This graph captures user interactions with ads, containing over 9 million edges.
4. **SearchQuery-Pin Graph**: This graph represents the relationship between search queries and pins, with nearly 190 million edges.
5. **Creator-IdeaPin Graph**: This graph captures the relationship between creators and idea pins, with over 12 million edges.
6. **IdeaPin-User Graph**: This graph represents interactions between idea pins and users, containing over 41 million edges.

In the **experiments section**, the authors also provide statistics about the number of distinct query pins, engaged pins, and query-engaged pin pairs, which further emphasizes the scale of the datasets used.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets or related works mentioned. However, the paper primarily discusses the bipartite graphs constructed from Pinterest's internal data, and it does not provide external dataset citations. Therefore, I will focus on documenting the internal datasets as described in the paper.

The final step will be to compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the paper itself, as it serves as the primary source for the datasets.

The citation for the paper is:

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for review or further processing.
