To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ProbMCL: Simple Probabilistic Contrastive Learning for Multi-Label Visual Classification" by Ahmad Sajedi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors validate their framework using datasets from the computer vision and medical imaging domains, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experimental Results)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for evaluation. They state that they evaluate the performance of their method using two benchmark multi-label image recognition datasets: **MS-COCO** and **ADP (Atlas of Digital Pathology)**. This section will provide insights into the datasets' characteristics and their relevance to the study.

In this section, the authors describe **MS-COCO** as a well-known computer vision dataset, which is widely used for various tasks, including multi-label classification. They also mention **ADP** as a medical imaging dataset, specifically designed for deep learning applications in pathology.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **MS-COCO**, the citation is:
  > T.-Y. Lin, M. Maire, S. Belongie, J. Hays, P. Perona, D. Ramanan, P. Dollár, and C. L. Zitnick. *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. In European Conference on Computer Vision, pages 740–755, 2014.

- For **ADP (Atlas of Digital Pathology)**, the citation is:
  > M. S. Hosseini, L. Chan, G. Tse, M. Tang, J. Deng, S. Norouzi, C. Rowsell, K. N. Plataniotis, and S. Damaskinos. *Atlas of Digital Pathology: A Generalized Hierarchical Histological Tissue Type-Annotated Database for Deep Learning*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 11 747–11 756, 2019.

Having gathered the necessary information, I will now compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described accurately and includes the full citation as required. This will prepare the information for structured output or further analysis.
