To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fairness-Aware Node Representation Learning" by Öykü Deniz Köse and Yanning Shen, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on fairness in graph contrastive learning, but it does not specify datasets. The introduction discusses the importance of node representation learning and mentions various applications, but again, no datasets are explicitly named.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. In **subsection 4.1 (Datasets and Settings)**, the authors mention two datasets: **Pokec-z** and **Pokec-n**. They provide details about these datasets, including the number of nodes, edges, features, and the sensitive attributes involved.

1. **Pokec-z Dataset**: This dataset consists of 7,659 users, with 29,476 edges and 59 features. The sensitive attribute is the region of the users, and the dataset is derived from a larger social network dataset called Pokec.

2. **Pokec-n Dataset**: This dataset includes 6,185 users, with 21,844 edges and also 59 features. Similar to Pokec-z, the sensitive attribute is the region of the users.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The authors reference the original Pokec dataset as follows:

- For **Pokec Dataset**:
  > Takac, L., & Zabovsky, M. (2012). Data analysis in public social networks. In International Scientific Conference and International Workshop. 'Present Day Trends of Innovations', vol. 1, no. 6, May 2012.

Since the datasets Pokec-z and Pokec-n are derived from the original Pokec dataset, I will use the citation for the Pokec dataset as the authoritative source.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations in the appropriate format. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
