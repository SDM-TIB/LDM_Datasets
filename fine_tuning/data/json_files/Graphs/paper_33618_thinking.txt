To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Exploiting Liver CT scans in Colorectal Carcinoma" by Daniele Perlo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study involves a dataset of CT scans for colorectal carcinoma, which suggests that there may be specific datasets referenced later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **Methods section**, particularly the subsection titled **Dataset**. Here, the authors describe their dataset, which they refer to as **CRC4AI**. They provide details about the dataset, including the number of patients, lesions, and the criteria for inclusion. This section is crucial as it contains the primary dataset used in their study.

In addition to CRC4AI, the authors mention two other datasets used for pretraining their model: **IRCADb** and **LiTS17**. I will take note of these datasets as well, as they are relevant to the research.

Now, I will gather the necessary details for each dataset:

1. **CRC4AI**: This dataset consists of CT images collected from 50 patients with advanced colorectal carcinoma, totaling 92 liver lesions. The authors describe the strict criteria for patient selection and the data collection process.

2. **IRCADb**: This dataset includes 15 patients with 118 annotated liver lesions. It is primarily designed for segmentation tasks.

3. **LiTS17**: This is a larger dataset that contains 130 patients and 885 annotated liver lesions, also intended for segmentation tasks.

Next, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is essential for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access these datasets.

The citations I will extract are:

- For **CRC4AI**, since it is a novel dataset created by the authors, I will note that it is planned for public release in 2023, but it may not have a formal citation yet.

- For **IRCADb**, the citation is:
  > Soler, L., Hostettler, A., Agnus, V., Charnoz, A., Fasquel, J., Moreau, J., Osswald, A., Bouhadja, M., Marescaux, J. *3D image reconstruction for comparison of algorithm database: A patient specific anatomical and medical image database*. IRCAD, Strasbourg, France, Tech. Rep (2010).

- For **LiTS17**, the citation is:
  > Bilic, P., et al. *The liver tumor segmentation benchmark (lits)*. CoRR abs/1901.04056 (2019), http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.04056.

Finally, I will compile the information about each dataset, including their descriptions and citations, ensuring that I maintain clarity and accuracy in the details provided. This structured approach will help in creating a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
