To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learn molecular representations from large-scale unlabeled molecules for drug discovery" by Pengyong Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to gather initial insights about the datasets. The abstract mentions that the proposed method was evaluated on **13 benchmark datasets** for various drug discovery tasks, which indicates that multiple datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **results section**, particularly the subsections that detail the experiments and evaluations. In this section, the authors provide a table summarizing the performance of their method on different datasets. This table is crucial as it lists the datasets used for molecular properties prediction, drug-drug interaction (DDI), and drug-target interaction (DTI).

Upon reviewing the results, I identify the following datasets:

1. **BBBP**: A dataset used for blood-brain barrier penetration prediction, containing 2,039 molecules.
2. **SIDER**: A dataset for side effect prediction, consisting of 1,427 molecules.
3. **ClinTox**: A dataset for clinical toxicity prediction, with 1,478 molecules.
4. **BACE**: A dataset for predicting activity against the β-secretase enzyme, containing 1,513 molecules.
5. **Tox21**: A dataset for toxicity prediction, which includes 7,831 molecules.
6. **ToxCast**: A dataset for toxicity prediction with 8,575 molecules.
7. **ESOL**: A dataset for solubility prediction, containing 1,128 molecules.
8. **Lipo**: A dataset for lipophilicity prediction, consisting of 4,200 molecules.
9. **FreeSolv**: A dataset for solvation free energy prediction, with 642 molecules.

Additionally, the paper mentions that the authors participated in a DDI prediction task using the **BIOSNAP** dataset and a DTI prediction task using the **Human** and **C.elegans** datasets.

Now, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is essential for proper attribution and to provide context for future researchers.

The citations I find are as follows:
