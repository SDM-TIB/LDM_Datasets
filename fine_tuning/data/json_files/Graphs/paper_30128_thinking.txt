To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Data augmentation on graphs for table type classification" by Davide del Bimbo, Andrea Gemelli, and Simone Marinai, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of the **Tab2Know dataset**, which is a strong indication that this dataset is central to the research.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (The Tab2Know dataset)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the dataset. They explain that the Tab2Know dataset contains tables extracted from scientific papers in the Semantic Scholar Open Research Corpus. The dataset includes 73,000 tables, which are labeled using a weak supervision approach and human verification.

In this section, the authors also mention that they used a subset of the Tab2Know dataset for their experiments, specifically noting that they obtained a subset containing **33,069 tables extracted from 11,800 scientific documents**. This subset is further categorized into four classes: Observation, Input, Example, and Other.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Tab2Know dataset. The relevant citation is:

- For **Tab2Know dataset**, the citation is:
  > Kruit, B., He, H., & Urbani, J. (2021). *Tab2Know: building a Knowledge Base from tables in scientific papers*. ArXiv abs/2107.13306.

Since the authors refer to the Tab2Know dataset throughout the paper, I will ensure to include this citation in my dataset extraction.

Finally, I will compile the information about the dataset into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the dataset used in the research.
