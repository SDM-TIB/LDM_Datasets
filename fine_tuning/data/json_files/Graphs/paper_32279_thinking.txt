To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fundamental limits of overparametrized shallow neural networks for supervised learning" by Francesco Camilli, Daria Tieplova, and Jean Barbier, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a high-level overview, and the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the datasets used in the research.

Next, I will look for specific sections that typically contain dataset information, such as **"Datasets," "Experiments," or "Methodology."** In this paper, I will focus on sections that describe the experimental setup, as they usually detail the datasets used for training and evaluation.

Upon reviewing the paper, I will note any datasets explicitly mentioned, including their names, characteristics, and any relevant statistics. For example, if the authors mention using a dataset with a specific number of samples or features, I will record that information.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research. I will ensure that I capture the authors, title, publication venue, and year for each dataset.

If the paper refers to well-known datasets, I will cross-reference them with existing literature to ensure I have the correct citations. For instance, if the paper mentions the "Penn Action Dataset," I will look up its citation in the literature.

Finally, I will compile the extracted datasets and their citations into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited. This will facilitate further analysis or integration into other research efforts.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets used in the research paper.
