To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Few-Example Clustering via Contrastive Learning" by Minguk Jang and Sae-Young Chung, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant details, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. In the abstract, the authors mention conducting extensive experiments on two datasets: **mini-ImageNet** and **CUB-200-2011**. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for understanding the experiments conducted.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used. In section 4.1, they explicitly state that they evaluate their method on the **mini-ImageNet** and **CUB-200-2011** datasets. They describe mini-ImageNet as consisting of 100 classes with 600 images each, and CUB-200-2011 as containing 11,788 images of birds across 200 classes.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **mini-ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Deng, J., Dong, W., Socher, R., Li, L., Kai Li, and Li Fei-Fei. *Imagenet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pp. 248â€“255, 2009. doi: 10.1109/CVPR.2009.5206848.

- For **CUB-200-2011**, the citation is:
  > Wah, C., Branson, S., Welinder, P., Perona, P., and Belongie, S. *The Caltech-UCSD Birds-200-2011 Dataset*. Technical report, 2011.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will summarize the findings:

1. **mini-ImageNet**: A dataset consisting of 100 classes with 600 images each, used for testing generic visual recognition capabilities.
   - Citation: Deng et al. (2009).

2. **CUB-200-2011**: A dataset containing 11,788 images of birds across 200 classes, used for fine-grained image classification.
   - Citation: Wah et al. (2011).

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly presents each dataset along with its citation, ensuring that all details are accurately captured for future reference or processing.
