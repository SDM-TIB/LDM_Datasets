To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A New Graph Node Classification Benchmark: Learning Structure from Histology Cell Graphs" by Claudia Vanea et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the introduction of a new benchmark dataset called **Placenta**, which is crucial for my extraction process. The introduction further elaborates on the dataset's purpose and characteristics, indicating that it consists of cell graphs from placenta histology images.

Next, I will look into **section 2 (Dataset Description)**, where the authors provide a detailed overview of the **Placenta** dataset. They describe it as consisting of two cell graphs from healthy placenta histology images, totaling 2,395,747 nodes, with 799,745 nodes having ground truth labels. This section is essential as it contains specific details about the dataset's structure and the challenges it addresses.

I will also check the **experiments section** to confirm that the dataset is used in the experiments and to gather any additional context about its application. The authors mention using the **Placenta** dataset for evaluating various scalable models, which reinforces its significance in the study.

After gathering the necessary information about the dataset, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citation for the **Placenta** dataset. The authors reference their own work for the dataset's creation, which is indicated as follows:

- For the **Placenta** dataset, the citation is:
  > Claudia Vanea, Jonathan Campbell, Omri Dodi, Liis Salumäe, Karen Meir, Drorith Hochner-Celnikier, Hagit Hochner, Triin Laisk, Linda M. Ernst, Cecilia M. Lindgren, and Christoffer Nellåker. *A New Graph Node Classification Benchmark: Learning Structure from Histology Cell Graphs*. In Proceedings of the 36th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2022).

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use. This includes ensuring that the dataset's name, description, and citation are clearly articulated for anyone who may reference this extraction in the future.
