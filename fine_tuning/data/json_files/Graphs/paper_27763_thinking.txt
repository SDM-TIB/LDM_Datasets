To extract datasets from the research paper titled "GraphFM: Graph Factorization Machines for Feature Interaction Modeling" by Zekun Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on several real-world datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, there is a **Table 1** in the experiments section that summarizes the statistics of the evaluation datasets. This table provides key information about the datasets used in the experiments.

The datasets listed in Table 1 are:

1. **Criteo Dataset**: This dataset is described as having 45,840,617 instances, 39 fields, and 998,960 sparse features. It is a well-known dataset for click-through rate (CTR) prediction.

2. **Avazu Dataset**: This dataset contains 40,428,967 instances, 23 fields, and 1,544,488 sparse features. It is also used for CTR prediction.

3. **MovieLens-1M Dataset**: This dataset includes 739,012 instances, 7 fields, and 3,529 features. It is a popular dataset for recommender systems.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations for these datasets are typically included in the references or can be found through a quick search if they are well-known datasets.

The full citations for the datasets are:

- **Criteo Dataset**:
  > Criteo. *Criteo Display Advertising Challenge Dataset*. Available at: https://www.kaggle.com/c/criteo-display-ad-challenge.

- **Avazu Dataset**:
  > Avazu. *Avazu Click-Through Rate Prediction Dataset*. Available at: https://www.kaggle.com/c/avazu-ctr-prediction.

- **MovieLens-1M Dataset**:
  > GroupLens Research. *MovieLens 1M Dataset*. Available at: http://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets, I will compile this into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations. This will ensure that all relevant details are captured for further processing or review.
