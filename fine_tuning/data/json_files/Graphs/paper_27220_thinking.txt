To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Active Screening for Recurrent Diseases: A Reinforcement Learning Approach" by Han-Ching Ou et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract and introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study and may highlight key datasets used for evaluation. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets in relation to the research problem.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically section 5, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they explicitly list the datasets and provide brief descriptions of each. I will take note of the names of the datasets and any relevant details provided.

The paper mentions several datasets, including:

1. **Hospital Dataset**: A contact network collected by wearable devices in a university hospital, where links are established based on close-range interactions.
2. **India Dataset**: A network collected from a village in India through household surveys, representing real-world social contacts.
3. **Face-to-Face Dataset**: A network describing face-to-face interactions during an exhibition in Dublin, simulating potential influenza spread.
4. **Flu Dataset**: A network of close proximity interactions in an American high school, collected using wireless sensor technology.
5. **Irvine Dataset**: A network from an online student community at UC Irvine, used to analyze information spread through online messaging.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including their descriptions and citations, into a structured format for easy reference and further analysis.
