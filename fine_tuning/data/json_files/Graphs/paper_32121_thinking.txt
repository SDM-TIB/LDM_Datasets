To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-level Cross-modal Feature Alignment via Contrastive Learning towards Zero-shot Classification of Remote Sensing Image Scenes" by Chun Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses zero-shot classification and mentions that extensive experiments were conducted, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors highlight the challenges of preparing sufficient samples for each class of image scenes and mention the use of zero-shot learning methods. This indicates that they may have utilized specific datasets for their experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors describe their experimental setup. They mention using a dataset that has been referenced in the work of Li et al. [5]. This is a crucial clue, as it implies that the dataset is not only relevant but also cited in the references.

In the **dataset and preprocessing subsection**, the authors specify that they used a dataset with **70 classes and 800 image scenes per class**, with each image scene sized at 256x256 pixels. However, they do not provide a specific name for this dataset in the text.

To find the full citation for the dataset, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. The reference [5] corresponds to:
> Y. Li, D. Kong, Y. Zhang, Y. Tan, and L. Chen. "Robust deep alignment network with remote sensing knowledge graph for zero-shot and generalized zero-shot remote sensing image scene classification." ISPRS Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, vol. 179, pp. 145–158, 2021.

Now, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format. The dataset used in the experiments is as follows:

1. **Dataset Name**: The specific name of the dataset is not provided in the paper, but it is referenced as the dataset used in Li et al. [5].
2. **Description**: The dataset consists of 70 classes with 800 image scenes per class, each image scene sized at 256x256 pixels.
3. **Full Citation**: 
   > Y. Li, D. Kong, Y. Zhang, Y. Tan, and L. Chen. "Robust deep alignment network with remote sensing knowledge graph for zero-shot and generalized zero-shot remote sensing image scene classification." ISPRS Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, vol. 179, pp. 145–158, 2021.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entry for further processing or review.
