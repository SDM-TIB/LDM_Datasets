To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Dual Contrastive Learning for Unsupervised Image-to-Image Translation" by Junlin Han et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **experiments section (Section 4)**, the authors explicitly list the datasets they evaluated their methods on. I will focus on this section to gather detailed information about each dataset.

The paper mentions six different datasets used for evaluation:

1. **Horse ↔ Zebra**: This dataset contains 1067 horse images and 1344 zebra images for training, along with 260 test images. It was introduced in CycleGAN.

2. **Cat ↔ Dog**: This dataset consists of 5000 training images and 500 test images for each domain. It was introduced in StarGAN2.

3. **CityScapes**: This dataset includes 2975 training images and 500 validation images, focusing on city scenes and semantic segmentation labels.

4. **Van Gogh → Photo**: This dataset contains 400 Van Gogh paintings and 6287 photographs from Flickr, collected in CycleGAN.

5. **Label ↔ Facade**: Similar to CityScapes, this dataset has 400 paired training images and 106 paired test images from the CMP Facade Database.

6. **Orange → Apple**: This dataset includes 1019 orange images and 995 apple images for training, with 248 orange images for testing, sourced from ImageNet.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and further exploration of the datasets.

The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- **Horse ↔ Zebra**: 
  > Jun-Yan Zhu, Taesung Park, Phillip Isola, and Alexei A. Efros. *Unpaired image-to-image translation using cycle-consistent adversarial networks*. In IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2017.

- **Cat ↔ Dog**: 
  > Yunjey Choi, Youngjung Uh, Jaejun Yoo, and Jung-Woo Ha. *Stargan v2: Diverse image synthesis for multiple domains*. In IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2020.

- **Label ↔ Facade**: 
  > Radim Tylecek and Radim Sara. *Spatial pattern templates for recognition of objects with regular structure*. In German Conference on Pattern Recognition, 2013.

- **Orange → Apple**: 
  > Jia Deng et al. *Imagenet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2009.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is properly documented for future reference or analysis.
