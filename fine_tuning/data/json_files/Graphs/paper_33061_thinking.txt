To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Distributed Matrix-Based Sampling for Graph Neural Network Training" by Alok Tripathy et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors provide experimental results on the largest Open Graph Benchmark (OGB) datasets, which indicates that datasets are involved. I will look for specific names of datasets in these sections.

Next, I will navigate to **section 7 (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used in their experiments. In this section, they provide a table (Table 3) that summarizes the datasets, including their names, number of vertices, edges, batches, and features. The datasets mentioned are:

1. **Products Dataset**: 
   - Vertices: 196
   - Edges: 2.4M
   - Batches: 100
   - Features: 100

2. **Protein Dataset**: 
   - Vertices: 1024
   - Edges: 126M
   - Batches: 8.7M
   - Features: 128

3. **Papers Dataset**: 
   - Vertices: 1172
   - Edges: 111M
   - Batches: 1.6B
   - Features: 128

I will also check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. The authors mention that the Protein dataset is from the HipMCL data repository, and the Products and Papers datasets are from the Open Graph Benchmark by Hu et al. 

For the citations, I will note the following:

- **Products Dataset**: 
  > Hu, W., Fey, M., Zitnik, M., Dong, Y., Ren, H., Liu, B., Catasta, M., and Leskovec, J. *Open Graph Benchmark: Datasets for Machine Learning on Graphs*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2005.00687, 2020.

- **Protein Dataset**: 
  > Azad, A., Pavlopoulos, G. A., Ouzounis, C. A., Kyrpides, N. C., and BulucÂ¸, A. *HipMCL: A High-Performance Parallel Implementation of the Markov Clustering Algorithm for Large-Scale Networks*. Nucleic Acids Research, 46(6):e33, 2018.

- **Papers Dataset**: 
  > Hu, W., Fey, M., Zitnik, M., Dong, Y., Ren, H., Liu, B., Catasta, M., and Leskovec, J. *Open Graph Benchmark: Datasets for Machine Learning on Graphs*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2005.00687, 2020.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations into a structured format for further processing. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets and their sources as required.
