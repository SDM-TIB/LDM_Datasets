To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Constructing Stronger and Faster Baselines for Skeleton-based Action Recognition" by Yi-Fan Song et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the proposed method is evaluated on **two large-scale datasets**, which indicates that datasets are indeed involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experimental Results)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention:

1. **NTU RGB+D 60**: This dataset contains 56,880 human action videos collected by three Kinect v2 cameras, covering 60 action classes. The authors provide details about the training and evaluation splits, which are crucial for understanding how the dataset is structured.

2. **NTU RGB+D 120**: This is an extended version of the NTU RGB+D 60 dataset, containing 114,480 videos performed by 106 subjects across 155 viewpoints, covering 120 action classes. The authors also describe the training and evaluation splits for this dataset.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **NTU RGB+D 60**, the citation is:
  > A. Shahroudy, J. Liu, T.-T. Ng, and G. Wang. *NTU RGB+D: A large scale dataset for 3D human activity analysis*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 1010â€“1019, 2016.

- For **NTU RGB+D 120**, the citation is:
  > J. Liu, A. Shahroudy, M. L. Perez, G. Wang, L.-Y. Duan, and A. K. Chichung. *NTU RGB+D 120: A large-scale benchmark for 3D human activity understanding*. IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 2019.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets, I will compile the dataset entries with their full citations, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly referenced. This structured approach will help in accurately documenting the datasets used in the research.
