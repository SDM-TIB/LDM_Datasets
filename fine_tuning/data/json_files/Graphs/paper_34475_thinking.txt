To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Relative Counterfactual Contrastive Learning for Mitigating Pretrained Stance Bias in Stance Detection" by Jiarui Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss stance detection and reference several datasets. However, I need to locate specific mentions of datasets and their details. 

Next, I will examine the **experiments section**, particularly the subsection labeled **Datasets**. Here, the authors explicitly list the datasets used in their experiments. They mention three datasets:

1. **SemEval-2016 Task 6 Sub-task A dataset**: This dataset is widely used for stance detection tasks and contains five targets: "Atheism (AT)", "Climate Change is a real Concern (CC)", "Feminist Movement (FM)", "Hillary Clinton (HC)", and "Legalization of Abortion (LA)".

2. **UKP dataset**: This dataset consists of eight different topics, including "Abortion (AB)", "Cloning (CL)", "Death Penalty (DP)", "Gun Control (GC)", "Marijuana Legalization (ML)", "Minimum Wage (MW)", "Nuclear Energy (NE)", and "School Uniforms (SU)".

3. **VAST dataset**: This dataset is designed for zero-shot and few-shot stance detection and includes a wide range of targets covering various themes.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. 

The citations I need to extract are:

- For the **SemEval-2016 Task 6 Sub-task A dataset**, the citation is:
  > Saif Mohammad, Svetlana Kiritchenko, Parinaz Sobhani, Xiaodan Zhu, and Colin Cherry. *SemEval-2016 task 6: Detecting stance in tweets*. In Proceedings of the 10th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval-2016), pages 31–41, San Diego, California, 2016.

- For the **UKP dataset**, the citation is:
  > Christian Stab, Tristan Miller, Benjamin Schiller, Pranav Rai, and Iryna Gurevych. *Cross-topic argument mining from heterogeneous sources*. In Proceedings of the 2018 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 3664–3674, Brussels, Belgium, 2018.

- For the **VAST dataset**, the citation is:
  > Emily Allaway and Kathleen McKeown. *Zero-Shot stance detection: A dataset and model using generalized topic representations*. In Proceedings of the 2020 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 8913–8931, Online, 2020.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
