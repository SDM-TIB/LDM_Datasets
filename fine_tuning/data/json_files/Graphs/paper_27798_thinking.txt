To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Semantic-Aware Contrastive Learning for Multi-object Medical Image Segmentation" by Ho Hin Lee et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their method on "in-house data and MICCAI Challenge 2015 BTCV datasets," which indicates that there are at least two datasets to look for.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (specifically section IV) where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used. Here, they mention:

1. **MICCAI 2015 Challenge Beyond The Cranial Vault (BTCV) dataset**: This dataset consists of 100 de-identified 3D contrast-enhanced CT scans with 7968 axial slices. It includes annotations for 12 organs, and the resolution of the scans is specified.

2. **Non-contrast clinical cohort**: This dataset is retrieved from the ImageVU database of Vanderbilt University Medical Center, comprising 56 3D CT scans with expert annotations for the same 12 organs as the BTCV dataset.

3. **PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset**: This dataset includes 10,582 training images, 1,449 validation images, and 456 testing images with pixel-level annotations for 20 classes and one background.

After identifying these datasets, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

- For the **MICCAI 2015 BTCV dataset**, the citation is:
  > Landman, B., Xu, Z., Iglesias, J., Styner, M., Langerak, T., & Klein, A. (2015). *MICCAI Multi-Atlas Labeling Beyond the Cranial Vault—Workshop Challenge*. In Proceedings of the MICCAI Multi-Atlas Labeling Beyond Cranial Vault—Workshop Challenge.

- For the **Non-contrast clinical cohort**, since it is an in-house dataset, it may not have a formal citation, but I will note it as:
  > ImageVU database, Vanderbilt University Medical Center.

- For the **PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset**, the citation is:
  > Everingham, M., Van Gool, L., Williams, C. K. I., Winn, J., & Zisserman, A. (2012). *The PASCAL Visual Object Classes Challenge 2012 (VOC2012)*. Retrieved from http://www.pascal-network.org/challenges/VOC/voc2012/workshop/index.html.

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations for further processing or review.
