To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Contrastive Meta Learning with Behavior Multiplicity for Recommendation" by Wei Wei et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that extensive experiments were conducted on three real-world datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed present. I will look for specific names and descriptions of these datasets.

Next, I will navigate to the **experiments section** (section 4.1) where the authors provide details about the datasets used. Here, I will find the following datasets explicitly mentioned:

1. **Tmall Dataset**: This dataset is collected from Tmall, one of the largest e-commerce platforms in China, and includes user behavior data with various interactions such as page views, favorites, carts, and purchases. The statistics indicate 31,882 users, 31,232 items, and 1,451,219 interactions.

2. **IJCAI-Contest Dataset**: This dataset was used in the IJCAI15 Challenge and reflects a business-to-customer retail system. It shares the same behavior types as the Tmall dataset, with 17,435 users, 35,920 items, and 799,368 interactions.

3. **Retail Rocket Dataset**: This dataset is collected from the Retail Rocket recommender system and includes interactions such as page views, add-to-cart, and transactions. It consists of 2,174 users, 30,113 items, and 97,381 interactions.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. However, since the datasets are likely proprietary or specific to the authors' research, they may not have formal citations like traditional datasets. Instead, I will document them as described in the paper.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its relevant statistics and context.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for review, ensuring that all necessary details are included for each dataset extracted from the paper.
