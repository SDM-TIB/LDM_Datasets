To extract datasets from the research paper titled "LightGCL: Simple Yet Effective Graph Contrastive Learning for Recommendation" by Xuheng Cai et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract states that experiments were conducted on several benchmark datasets, which indicates that specific datasets will be discussed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4.1), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they mention five real-world datasets:

1. **Yelp**: This dataset consists of 29,601 users, 24,734 items, and 1,069,128 interactions, collected from the rating interactions on the Yelp platform.
2. **Gowalla**: This dataset contains 50,821 users, 57,440 items, and 1,172,425 interactions, derived from users' check-in records on the Gowalla platform.
3. **ML-10M**: A well-known movie-rating dataset for collaborative filtering, comprising 69,878 users, 10,195 items, and 6,999,171 interactions.
4. **Amazon-book**: This dataset is composed of users’ ratings on books collected from Amazon, featuring 78,578 users, 77,801 items, and 2,240,156 interactions.
5. **Tmall**: An E-commerce dataset containing users’ purchase records on different products in Tmall, with 47,939 users, 41,390 items, and 2,357,450 interactions.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. However, the datasets themselves may not have dedicated citations in the references, as they are commonly used datasets in the field. In such cases, I will provide the standard citations for these datasets based on their common usage:

- **Yelp Dataset**: 
  > Yelp Dataset Challenge. *Yelp Dataset*. Available at: https://www.yelp.com/dataset.

- **Gowalla Dataset**: 
  > Gowalla Dataset. *Gowalla Check-in Data*. Available at: https://snap.stanford.edu/data/loc-gowalla.html.

- **ML-10M Dataset**: 
  > F. Maxwell Harper and Joseph A. Konstan. *The MovieLens Datasets: History and Context*. ACM Transactions on Interactive Intelligent Systems, 5(4):19, 2015.

- **Amazon-book Dataset**: 
  > Julian McAuley and Jure Leskovec. *Hidden Factors and Hidden Topics: Understanding Rating Dimensions with Review Text*. In Proceedings of the 7th ACM Conference on Recommender Systems, pages 6–12, 2013.

- **Tmall Dataset**: 
  > Tmall Dataset. *Tmall E-commerce Data*. Available at: https://tianchi.aliyun.com/dataset/dataDetail?dataId=56.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
