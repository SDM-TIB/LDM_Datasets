To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DocumentCLIP: Linking Figures and Main Body Text in Reflowed Documents" by Fuxiao Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors collected a large Wikipedia dataset for pretraining, which indicates that this dataset is significant and likely to be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets**. In this paper, the relevant information is found in **section 3 (Pretraining Dataset)**. Here, the authors describe the dataset they collected from Wikipedia, which includes 66,000 articles and 320,000 images/caption pairs. This section provides essential details about the dataset's structure and the criteria used for its creation.

The authors also mention that they used the latest English Wikipedia dump to extract articles and that they regard all sentences within the same section as ground truth for the associations between images and text. This is crucial for understanding how the dataset is structured.

Now, I will gather the full citation for the Wikipedia dataset. The authors do not provide a specific citation for the dataset itself, but they reference the use of Wikipedia articles, which can be cited as follows:

- For the Wikipedia dataset, the citation is:
  > Wikipedia contributors. *Wikipedia, The Free Encyclopedia*. Available at: https://www.wikipedia.org/

Additionally, the authors mention that they do not have the rights to use certain datasets referenced in the paper, which indicates that they are focusing on their own dataset.

Finally, I will summarize the dataset information extracted:

1. **Wikipedia Dataset**: A large dataset collected from Wikipedia, containing 66,000 articles and 320,000 images/caption pairs. The dataset is structured to link sections of text with corresponding images and captions.

Now, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
