To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An Empirical Study on Leveraging Position Embeddings for Target-oriented Opinion Words Extraction" by Samuel Mensah et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study but does not specify datasets. The introduction discusses the task of target-oriented opinion words extraction (TOWE) but does not mention specific datasets either.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In **section 3.2 (Data)**, the authors explicitly state that they use four benchmark datasets: **restaurant (Res14, Res15, Res16)** and **laptop (Lap14)** reviews from SemEval. This is a crucial finding as it indicates the datasets utilized in their experiments.

I will then look for detailed statistics about these datasets in **Table 2**, which provides information such as the number of sentences, average sentence length, number of aspect terms, number of opinion words, and average dependency and sequential distances. This information is essential for understanding the datasets' characteristics.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The authors reference the SemEval tasks, which are crucial for the datasets:

- For **SemEval 2014 Task 4 (Res14)**, the citation is:
  > Maria Pontiki, Dimitrios Galanis, John Pavlopoulos, Ion Androutsopoulos, and Harris Papageorgiou, Suresh Manandhar. *SemEval-2014 Task 4: Aspect based sentiment analysis*. In Proceedings of the 8th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval 2014), page 27–35, 2014.

- For **SemEval 2015 Task 12 (Res15)**, the citation is:
  > Maria Pontiki, Dimitrios Galanis, Harris Papageorgiou, Suresh Manandhar, and Ion Androutsopoulos. *SemEval-2015 Task 12: Aspect based sentiment analysis*. In Proceedings of the 9th international workshop on semantic evaluation (SemEval 2015), pages 486–495, 2015.

- For **SemEval 2016 Task 5 (Res16)**, the citation is:
  > Maria Pontiki, Dimitrios Galanis, Haris Papageorgiou, Ion Androutsopoulos, Suresh Manandhar, Mohammad Al-Smadi, Mahmoud Al-Ayyoub, Yanyan Zhao, Bing Qin, Orphée De Clercq, et al. *SemEval-2016 Task 5: Aspect based sentiment analysis*. In International workshop on semantic evaluation, pages 19–30, 2016.

- For **SemEval 2014 Task 4 (Lap14)**, the citation is the same as for Res14 since it is part of the same task.

With this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the study, along with their respective citations.
