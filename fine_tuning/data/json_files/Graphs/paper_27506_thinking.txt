To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Enriched Music Representations with Multiple Cross-modal Contrastive Learning" by Andres Ferraro et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their approach on three tasks, which suggests that multiple datasets are involved. I will look for any specific dataset names or descriptions in these sections.

Next, I will focus on the **evaluation section** (section 3), where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they explicitly mention the **Melon Playlist Dataset** as the dataset used to train their models. I will note the details provided about this dataset, including the number of songs, playlists, and genres.

In the same section, the authors also refer to the **GTZAN dataset** for genre classification and the **MTG-Jamendo dataset** for automatic tagging. I will extract the relevant details about these datasets as well.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

1. **Melon Playlist Dataset**:
   > Ferraro, A., Kim, Y., Lee, S., Kim, B., Jo, N., Lim, S., Lim, S., Jang, J., Kim, S., Serra, X., & Bogdanov, D. (2021). *Melon playlist dataset: a public dataset for audio-based playlist generation and music tagging*. In International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP 2021).

2. **GTZAN Dataset**:
   > Tzanetakis, G., & Cook, P. (2002). *Musical genre classification of audio signals*. IEEE Transactions on Speech and Audio Processing, 10(5), 293-302.

3. **MTG-Jamendo Dataset**:
   > Bogdanov, D., Won, M., Tovstogan, P., Porter, A., & Serra, X. (2019). *The MTG-Jamendo dataset for automatic music tagging*. In Proceedings of the Machine Learning for Music Discovery Workshop, 36th International Conference on Machine Learning, ML4MD at ICML 2019.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will prepare the information for any required structured output or further analysis.
