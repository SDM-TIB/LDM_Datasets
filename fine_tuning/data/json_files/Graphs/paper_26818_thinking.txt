To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Group-wise Contrastive Learning for Neural Dialogue Generation" by Hengyi Cai et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on "three large-scale conversation datasets," which indicates that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention three datasets:

1. **PersonaChat**: This dataset contains multi-turn dialogues collected via Amazon Mechanical Turk, specifically designed for conversational agents. The authors provide statistics such as the number of context-response pairs and average turns per context.

2. **Douban Corpus**: This dataset consists of daily conversations from a popular social networking service in China. Similar to PersonaChat, the authors provide statistics regarding the number of training, validation, and test pairs.

3. **OpenSubtitles**: This dataset includes human-human conversations derived from movie transcripts. The authors again provide relevant statistics about the dataset.

In the **table (Table 1)** within section 3, the authors summarize the data statistics for these three datasets, which further confirms their usage in the experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **PersonaChat**, the citation is:
  > Zhang, Y., Dinan, E., Urbanek, J., Szlam, A., Kiela, D., & Weston, J. (2018). Personalizing dialogue agents: I have a dog, do you have pets too? In *Proceedings of the 56th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL)*.

- For **Douban Corpus**, the citation is:
  > Wu, Y., Wu, Y., Chen, Y., & Zhang, Y. (2017). Sequential matching network: A new architecture for multi-turn response selection in retrieval-based chatbots. In *Proceedings of the 55th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL)*.

- For **OpenSubtitles**, the citation is:
  > Lison, P., & Tiedemann, J. (2016). Opensubtitles2016: Extracting large parallel corpora from movie and TV subtitles. In *Proceedings of the 10th International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC)*.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation, ready for structured output.
