To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Transformers for One-Shot Visual Imitation" by Sudeep Dasari and Abhinav Gupta, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and while it may not explicitly mention datasets, it sets the context for the experiments. The introduction often discusses related work and may reference datasets used in prior studies.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experimental Results)**, particularly **subsection 4.1 (Simulation Environment and Tasks)**, where the authors describe the environments and tasks used for their experiments. Here, they mention that they collected training data using an expert pick-place policy in the target environments. This indicates that there is a dataset involved, but I need to find specific names and details.

In **subsection 4.1**, the authors state that they collected **100 train task instances for each of the 16 tasks**, resulting in **1600 total demonstration videos alongside 1600 expert robot trajectories**. However, they do not provide a specific name for this dataset. I will note this information for context.

Next, I will check the **References section** to see if any datasets are cited. The authors reference prior works that may have datasets associated with them, such as RoboTurk, which is mentioned in the context of the environments used. The citation for RoboTurk is:

- For **RoboTurk**:
  > A. Mandlekar, Y. Zhu, A. Garg, J. Booher, M. Spero, A. Tung, J. Gao, J. Emmons, A. Gupta, E. Orbay, et al. *Roboturk: A crowdsourcing platform for robotic skill learning through imitation*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1811.02790, 2018.

Additionally, I will look for any other datasets mentioned in the paper, especially in the context of the tasks or environments used. If the authors refer to any specific datasets for training or evaluation, I will extract their names and citations.

After gathering all relevant information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and that full citations are included. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, which is crucial for reproducibility and further research.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for easy reference and use in future work.
