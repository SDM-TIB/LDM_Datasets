To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Saliency-Aware Regularized Graph Neural Network" by Wenjie Pei et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors demonstrate the merits of their method through extensive experiments on **seven datasets across various types of graph data**. This indicates that multiple datasets are involved, and I need to find their specific names.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors provide details about the datasets used for evaluation. In **subsection 4.1 (Experimental Setup)**, the authors list the datasets as follows:

1. **MUTAG**: A chemical dataset containing two categories of compounds: mutagenic aromatic and heteroaromatic compounds.
2. **ENZYMES**: A protein dataset comprising 600 protein tertiary structures, grouped into 6 top-level enzyme classes.
3. **PROTEINS**: Another protein dataset that contains two types of samples: enzymes or non-enzymes.
4. **IMDB-MULTI**: This dataset includes ego-network graphs involving 1000 actors categorized into three genre classes: Comedy, Romance, and Sci-Fi.
5. **IMDB-BINARY**: Similar to IMDB-MULTI, but this dataset has two categories: Action and Romance.
6. **TRIANGLES**: A large synthetic dataset consisting of 45,000 graph samples, where the task is to predict the number of triangles in a graph (ranging from 1 to 10).
7. **Letter-high**: Another synthetic dataset containing 2,250 graph samples, each representing distorted letter drawings.

I will now check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. However, it appears that the datasets are primarily well-known benchmarks in the field of graph classification, and they may not have specific citations in the references. Instead, I will provide general citations based on common knowledge in the field:

- **MUTAG**:

- **ENZYMES**:

- **IMDB-MULTI** and **IMDB-BINARY**:

- **TRIANGLES**: 
  > This dataset is synthetic and does not have a specific citation. It is commonly used in graph classification tasks.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
