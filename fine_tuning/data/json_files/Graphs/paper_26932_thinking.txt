To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Metapath and Entity-Aware Graph Neural Network for Recommendation" by Muhammad Umer Anwaar et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted empirical evaluations on several datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention three datasets: **MovieLens-small**, **MovieLens-25M**, and **Yelp**. I will extract the relevant details about each dataset, including their characteristics and the context in which they were used.

1. **MovieLens-small**: This dataset is described as having approximately 100,000 ratings, with a 10-core setting where each user and item has at least 10 interactions. It is widely recognized as a benchmark dataset for movie recommendation.

2. **MovieLens-25M**: This is a larger version of the MovieLens dataset, containing around 25 million ratings. The authors specify that they selected items with at least 10 interactions and users with 10 to 300 interactions to ensure quality.

3. **Yelp**: This dataset is used for business recommendations and contains around 10 million interactions. The authors note that they consider businesses as items and reviews as interactions, and they also utilize user features to build a heterogeneous information network (HIN).

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

- For **MovieLens-small**, the citation is:
  > GroupLens Research. *MovieLens Datasets*. Available at: https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/

- For **MovieLens-25M**, the citation is:
  > GroupLens Research. *MovieLens Datasets*. Available at: https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/

- For **Yelp**, the citation is:
  > Yelp. *Yelp Dataset Challenge*. Available at: https://www.yelp.com/dataset

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their proper citations.
