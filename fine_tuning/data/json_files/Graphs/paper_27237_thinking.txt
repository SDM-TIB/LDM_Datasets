To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Development and evaluation of a 3D annotation software for interactive COVID-19 lesion segmentation in chest CT" by Simone Bendazzoli et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors are addressing the need for large manually segmented datasets for training machine learning models, which suggests that datasets may be discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly looking for any explicit mentions of datasets used for testing or training. In this section, the authors mention that they tested their pipeline on the **COVID-19 CT Lung and Infection Segmentation Dataset**. This is a clear indication of a dataset being utilized.

I will then check the **results section** to see if there are any additional datasets mentioned or if the authors provide further details about the dataset used. The authors confirm that they used the **COVID-19 CT Lung and Infection Segmentation Dataset** for their experiments, which reinforces its significance in their study.

Now, I will refer to the **references section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The relevant citation for the **COVID-19 CT Lung and Infection Segmentation Dataset** is:

- Jun, M., et al. *COVID-19 CT Lung and Infection Segmentation Dataset*. Zenodo, Apr, 2020.

I will also check if there are any other datasets mentioned in the paper. The authors refer to a reference segmentation provided by Ma et al. as part of the dataset, which may also be relevant. The citation for this reference is:

- Ma, J., et al. *Towards Efficient COVID-19 CT Annotation: A Benchmark for Lung and Infection Segmentation*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2004.12537, 2020.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets identified, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as they are crucial for proper attribution.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
