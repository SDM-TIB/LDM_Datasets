To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Automatic Alignment of Discourse Relations of Different Discourse Annotation Frameworks" by Yingxue Fu, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the paper discusses experiments on **RST-DT** and **PDTB 3.0**, suggesting that these are the datasets of interest.

Next, I will look for specific sections that detail the datasets used, particularly in the **methodology or experiments sections**. In this paper, the author mentions using **RST-DT** (Rhetorical Structure Theory Discourse Treebank) and **PDTB 3.0** (Penn Discourse Treebank) for their experiments. I will gather detailed descriptions of these datasets from the text.

In the **experiments section**, the author states that they conducted experiments on RST-DT and PDTB 3.0, confirming these datasets are utilized in the research. I will note any specific characteristics or details provided about these datasets, such as the number of instances or types of annotations.

Now, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. **RST-DT**:
   > Lynn Carlson, Daniel Marcu, and Mary Ellen Okurowski. *RST Discourse Treebank*. Distributed via LDC. Philadelphia: Linguistic Data Consortium: LDC2002T07, Text resources, 1.0, ISLRN: 299-735-991-930-2.

2. **PDTB 3.0**:
   > Rashmi Prasad, Bonnie Webber, Alan Lee, and Aravind Joshi. *Penn Discourse Treebank Version 3.0*. LDC. Distributed via LDC. Philadelphia: Linguistic Data Consortium: LDC2019T05, Text resources, 3.0, ISLRN 977-491-842-427-0.

With this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
