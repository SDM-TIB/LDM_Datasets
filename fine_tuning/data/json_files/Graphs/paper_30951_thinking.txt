To extract datasets from the research paper titled "TEMPCLR: Temporal Alignment Representation with Contrastive Learning" by Yuncong Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their approach on various tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved. I will look for specific mentions of datasets in these sections.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of video representation learning and mention the use of a dataset called **HowTo100M** for pre-training. This is a significant dataset, and I will note it down.

Next, I will check the **experiments section** where the authors detail their evaluation methods. In **section 4.1**, they mention using **YouCookII** for evaluation, which is another dataset I need to include. They also refer to **CrossTask** in section 4.2 for action step localization, which is relevant for my dataset extraction.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper from the **References section**:

1. **HowTo100M**:
   > Antoine Miech, Dimitri Zhukov, Jean-Baptiste Alayrac, Makarand Tapaswi, Ivan Laptev, and Josef Sivic. *Howto100m: Learning a text-video embedding by watching hundred million narrated video clips*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision, pp. 2630–2640, 2019.

2. **YouCookII**:
   > Zhou, Feng, et al. *YouCookII: A Large-Scale Dataset for Video-to-Text Generation*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 1000-1010, 2018.

3. **CrossTask**:
   > Zhukov, Dimitri, et al. *Cross-task weakly supervised learning from instructional videos*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 3537–3545, 2019.

After identifying these datasets and their citations, I will compile them into a structured format for further processing. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references for future use.
