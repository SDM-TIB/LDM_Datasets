To extract datasets from the research paper titled "FaceTouch: Detecting hand-to-face touch with supervised contrastive learning to assist in tracing infectious diseases" by Mohamed R. Ibrahim et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors introduce a new dataset for detecting hand-to-face touches, which suggests that there is a dataset to extract.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention the lack of existing benchmark datasets for recognizing hand-to-face touch, which reinforces the idea that they have created a new dataset. 

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, where the authors describe their dataset collection process. They state that they gathered over 20,000 images from Google Images, focusing on 10,413 images of individuals touching or not touching their faces. This section provides critical details about the dataset, including its size and the criteria for labeling.

The authors also mention that the dataset is divided into training and test sets with a ratio of 0.8 to 0.2. This information is essential for understanding how the dataset can be utilized.

In addition, the **results section** includes a summary table (Table 1) that outlines the datasets used in the research, confirming the details about the new dataset and providing a benchmark dataset (VOC) for object detection.

Now, I will look at the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper introduces a new dataset called **FaceTouch** and also utilizes the **VOC dataset**.

The full citation for the **FaceTouch dataset** is not explicitly provided in the references since it is a newly introduced dataset. However, I can summarize its details as follows:
- **FaceTouch Dataset**: A dataset containing 10,413 images (8,101 negative samples and 2,312 positive samples) collected from Google Images, focusing on various human poses in indoor and outdoor settings.

For the **VOC dataset**, the citation is:
> Everingham M, Eslami SMA, Van Gool L, Williams CKI, Winn J, Zisserman A. *The Pascal Visual Object Classes Challenge: A Retrospective*. Int J Comput Vis. 2015;111: 98â€“136. doi:10.1007/s11263-014-0733-5

Now, I will compile the extracted dataset information, ensuring to include the full citations for the datasets as required. This will prepare the information for structured output or further processing.
