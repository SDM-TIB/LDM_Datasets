To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Physics-driven GraphSAGE Method for Physical Process Simulations Described by Partial Differential Equations" by Hang Hu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any references to datasets or simulations that may have been used.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly the parts that describe the experiments conducted. This section often contains detailed information about the datasets used, including their names, sizes, and characteristics. I will look for any specific mentions of datasets related to the physical simulations described in the paper.

In the **results section**, the authors may discuss the outcomes of their experiments and the datasets used to validate their findings. This could provide additional context and confirmation of the datasets identified earlier.

I will also check the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned in the paper. This is crucial for proper attribution and to ensure that the datasets can be located by others.

From my reading, I will identify the following datasets:

1. **Electrostatics Field Problems Dataset**: This dataset is used in the experiments related to the Poisson equation for electrostatic fields. The authors describe the computational domain and the number of evaluated points used in their simulations.

2. **Electromagnetic Problems Dataset**: This dataset pertains to the Helmholtz equations used in the electromagnetic simulations. The authors provide details about the boundary conditions and the number of evaluated points.

3. **Heat Conduction Problems Dataset**: This dataset is related to the parametric Poisson equations for heat conduction. The authors mention the Gaussian random field used as a source term and the number of samples generated for training and validation.

After identifying these datasets, I will compile the full citations for each dataset from the references section. For example, if the authors refer to a specific dataset or method that has been previously published, I will ensure to include that citation.

Finally, I will summarize the datasets in a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation, ready for further processing or review.
