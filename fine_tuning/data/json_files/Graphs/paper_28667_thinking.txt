To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Spatial-Temporal Graphs for Active Speaker Detection" by Sourya Roy et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. In the abstract, the authors mention that they demonstrate their method on the **AVA-ActiveSpeaker dataset**, which indicates that this dataset is crucial for their experiments.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (section 4) to gather more details about the dataset. In section 4.1, the authors explicitly state that they perform experiments on the **AVA-ActiveSpeaker dataset**. They provide information about the dataset's characteristics, such as its derivation from Hollywood movies and the extensive annotations available for face tracks.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the **AVA-ActiveSpeaker dataset**. The citation provided in the paper is:
> Joseph Roth, Sourish Chaudhuri, Ondrej Klejch, Radhika Marvin, Andrew C. Gallagher, Liat Kaver, Sharadh Ramaswamy, Arkadiusz Stopczynski, Cordelia Schmid, Zhonghua Xi, and Caroline Pantofaru. *AVA-ActiveSpeaker: An Audio-Visual Dataset for Active Speaker Detection*. In IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP), 2020.

Since the paper primarily focuses on this dataset, I will ensure to include it in my dataset extraction.

Finally, I will compile the information regarding the dataset into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation as required. This will allow for a comprehensive understanding of the dataset used in the research and its significance in the context of the study.
