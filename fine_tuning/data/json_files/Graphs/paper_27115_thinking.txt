To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Scale Aware Adaptation for Land-Cover Classification in Remote Sensing Imagery" by Xueqing Deng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the challenges of land-cover classification and mentions the use of benchmark datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they explicitly mention three datasets:

1. **ISPRS Vaihingen Dataset**: This dataset contains 33 labeled tiles with 6 semantic classes. The authors specify that the spatial resolution is 9 cm, and they detail how they selected images for validation and training.

2. **ISPRS Potsdam Dataset**: This dataset consists of 38 tiles, with 24 annotated. The spatial resolution is 5 cm, and similar to the Vaihingen dataset, the authors describe the selection process for validation and training images.

3. **DeepGlobe Land Cover Classification Challenge Dataset**: This dataset includes 1146 satellite images with a pixel resolution of 50 cm, categorized into several classes. The authors mention the split into training, validation, and test sets.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **ISPRS Vaihingen Dataset**, the citation is:
  > ISPRS 2D Semantic Labeling Challenge. http://www2.isprs.org/commissions/comm3/wg4/semantic-labeling.html.

- For the **ISPRS Potsdam Dataset**, the citation is:
  > ISPRS 2D Semantic Labeling Challenge. http://www2.isprs.org/commissions/comm3/wg4/semantic-labeling.html.

- For the **DeepGlobe Land Cover Classification Challenge Dataset**, the citation is:
  > I. Demir et al. "DeepGlobe 2018: A Challenge to Parse the Earth through Satellite Images." In IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops (CVPRW), 2018.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will summarize the findings in a structured manner, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its citation. This will facilitate any further processing or review of the datasets extracted from the paper.
