To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Symmetry reduction for deep reinforcement learning active control of chaotic spatiotemporal dynamics" by Kevin Zeng and Michael D. Graham, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and it may mention specific datasets or experimental setups used in the study.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly any subsections that discuss experiments or data collection. This section often contains detailed descriptions of the datasets used, including their characteristics and how they were utilized in the experiments.

In this paper, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets related to the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky Equation (KSE) or any other experimental setups. If the authors refer to specific datasets or provide details about the data used for training or testing their deep reinforcement learning models, I will take note of those.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** for full citations. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets themselves. I will ensure to capture the authors, title, publication venue, and year for each dataset mentioned.

If the paper does not explicitly mention datasets but refers to data generated from simulations or experiments, I will note that as well, indicating that the data is derived from the authors' own experiments rather than an external dataset.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described with its full citation. This will include any relevant details such as the nature of the data, the context in which it was used, and any specific characteristics that are important for understanding its application in the research.

By following these steps, I will ensure a thorough extraction of datasets from the paper while maintaining proper citation practices.
