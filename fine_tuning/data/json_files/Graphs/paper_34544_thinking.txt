To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SmoothGNN: Smoothing-based GNN for Unsupervised Node Anomaly Detection" by Xiangyu Dong et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments on **9 real-world datasets**. This indicates that there are multiple datasets to look for, but I need to find their specific names and details.

Next, I will look into **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they provide a table (Table 1) that lists the datasets along with their characteristics, such as the number of nodes, edges, and anomaly ratios. The datasets mentioned are:

1. **Reddit**
2. **Tolokers**
3. **Amazon**
4. **T-Finance**
5. **YelpChi**
6. **Questions**
7. **Elliptic**
8. **DGraph-Fin**
9. **T-Social**

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The paper mentions that the datasets were obtained from a benchmark paper by Tang et al. (2023). Therefore, I will look for the citation for this benchmark paper to provide the necessary details.

The citation for the benchmark paper is:
> Jianheng Tang, Fengrui Hua, Ziqi Gao, Peilin Zhao, and Jia Li. *Gadbench: Revisiting and benchmarking supervised graph anomaly detection*. In NeurIPS, pp. 29628â€“29653, 2023.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the dataset names and the citation for the benchmark paper from which they were obtained.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format, ready for further processing or review.
