To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DHSEGATs: Distance and Hop-wise Structures Encoding Enhanced Graph Attention Networks" by Zhiguo Huang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, but I need to look for specific mentions of datasets.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of existing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and the need for improved structure and distance information. However, they do not explicitly mention any datasets at this point.

Next, I will examine the **methodology section** where the authors describe their approach in detail. They mention using the **ogbn-arxiv dataset** for their experiments. This is a key dataset that I need to document.

In the **experiments section**, the authors present results based on the **ogbn-arxiv dataset**. They provide performance comparisons and detailed results, confirming that this dataset is indeed used for evaluation.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the **ogbn-arxiv dataset**. The citation is as follows:
> Hu, Z., Dong, Y., Wang, K., Chang, K.-W., & Sun, Y. (2020). "Open Graph Benchmark: Datasets for Machine Learning on Graphs." In Proceedings of the 26th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery & Data Mining, pp. 1857â€“1867.

With this information, I will summarize the dataset details:

1. **ogbn-arxiv Dataset**: This dataset is used for node classification tasks and contains a citation network of arXiv papers. Each node represents a paper, and edges represent citations between them.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format for further processing, ensuring that the full citation is included for proper referencing.
