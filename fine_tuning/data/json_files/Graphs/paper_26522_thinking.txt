To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Exploiting Implicit Human Feedback for Improving RDF2vec Embeddings" by Ahmad Al Taweel and Heiko Paulheim, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research but does not explicitly mention datasets. However, the introduction discusses RDF2vec and its applications, which may lead to dataset mentions later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Approach)**, where the authors describe their methodology. Here, they mention using **DBpedia** as the knowledge graph for generating RDF2vec embeddings. This indicates that DBpedia is a dataset used in their experiments.

In **section 4 (Experiments)**, the authors detail their experimental setup. They mention two types of experiments: one involving **benchmark datasets for machine learning on the semantic web** and another using a **variant of the MovieLens dataset**. This section is crucial as it confirms the datasets used for evaluation.

I will look for specific mentions of the datasets in the text. The authors state that they used three sets of entities for their benchmarks: **cities, movies, and albums**, but they do not provide specific dataset names for these entities. However, they do mention that the MovieLens dataset is linked to DBpedia, which is important for citation.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. **DBpedia**:
   > Auer, S., Bizer, C., Kobilarov, G., Lehmann, J., Cyganiak, R., & Ives, Z. (2007). DBpedia: A nucleus for a web of open data. In The Semantic Web (pp. 722â€“735). Springer.

2. **MovieLens Dataset**:
   > Harper, F. M., & Konstan, J. A. (2015). The MovieLens Datasets: History and Context. ACM Transactions on Interactive Intelligent Systems, 5(4), 1-19.

Since the authors do not provide specific citations for the benchmark datasets (cities, movies, albums), I will note that they are commonly used datasets in the field but do not have specific references in this paper.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for DBpedia and the MovieLens dataset, while noting the lack of specific citations for the benchmark datasets used in the experiments.
