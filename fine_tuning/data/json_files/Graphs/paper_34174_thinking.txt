To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Anatomical Conditioning for Contrastive Unpaired Image-to-Image Translation of Optical Coherence Tomography Images" by Marc S. Seibel et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study involves an OCT dataset of Spectralis-OCT and Home-OCT images, which suggests that these are the primary datasets used.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors describe the dataset in detail. They mention that the dataset consists of images from **38 subjects**, each examined with both Spectralis-OCT and Home-OCT devices. The subjects were diagnosed with eye diseases, particularly neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD), and specific biomarkers were annotated by a clinical expert.

In the **experiments section**, the authors also provide details about the annotations, including subretinal fluids (SRF) and pigment epithelial detachment (PED), which are relevant biomarkers. This confirms the dataset's focus on medical imaging and its application in disease monitoring.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper cites a reference for the dataset used, which is:

- For the **Spectralis-OCT and Home-OCT dataset**, the citation is:
  > C. von der Burchard et al., “Self-Examination Low-Cost Full-Field Optical Coherence Tomography (SELFF-OCT) for neovascular age-related macular degeneration: A cross-sectional diagnostic accuracy study,” *BMJ Open*, vol. 12, no. 6, p. e055082, Jun. 2022.

Since the authors used both Spectralis-OCT and Home-OCT images from the same study, this citation will serve as the authoritative reference for the dataset.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including the dataset names and their full citations, ensuring that I have accurately captured all relevant details for future reference or processing.
