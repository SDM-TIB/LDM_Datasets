To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Contrastive Representation Learning for Whole Brain Cytoarchitectonic Mapping in Histological Human Brain Sections" by Christian Schiffer et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, but I need to look for specific dataset details in the main body of the paper.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of cytoarchitectonic maps and the challenges in identifying cytoarchitectonic areas. However, they do not mention specific datasets here.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, where the authors describe their approach to contrastive learning and the data used for training. In this section, they mention that the dataset contains **1860 histological human brain sections** stained for cell bodies, sampled from **7 postmortem human brains**. They also note that they used annotations of **113 cortical cytoarchitectonic areas** from different parts of the brain.

In the **results section**, the authors provide further details about the dataset, including the extraction of **1200 patches per cytoarchitectonic area** from 80% of the sections, which confirms the dataset's structure and usage.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper does not provide a specific citation for the dataset itself, as it is based on the authors' own collection of histological brain sections. However, they reference the **Julich-Brain cytoarchitectonic maps** in reference [2], which is relevant to the dataset's annotations.

The citation for the Julich-Brain cytoarchitectonic maps is:
> K. Amunts et al., “Julich-Brain: A 3D probabilistic atlas of the human brain’s cytoarchitecture,” Science, vol. 369, no. 7, pp. 988–992, 2020.

Since the dataset is derived from the authors' own research and does not have a formal citation like a publicly available dataset, I will note that the dataset is based on their own collection of histological sections and the annotations from the Julich-Brain atlas.

Finally, I will summarize the dataset information as follows:

1. **Dataset Name**: Histological Human Brain Sections
   - **Description**: Contains 1860 histological human brain sections stained for cell bodies, sampled from 7 postmortem human brains. Annotations of 113 cortical cytoarchitectonic areas are included.
   - **Citation**: K. Amunts et al., “Julich-Brain: A 3D probabilistic atlas of the human brain’s cytoarchitecture,” Science, vol. 369, no. 7, pp. 988–992, 2020.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format for further processing.
