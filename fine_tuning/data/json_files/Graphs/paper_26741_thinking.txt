To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Self-supervised Video Representation Learning Using Inter-intra Contrastive Framework" by Li Tao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to gather initial insights about the datasets used. In the abstract, the authors mention evaluating their method on video retrieval and recognition tasks, which suggests that they likely used specific datasets for these evaluations.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they state that they conducted evaluations on two benchmark datasets: **UCF101** and **HMDB51**. This is a clear indication that these datasets are crucial for their research.

I will then look for detailed descriptions of these datasets within the same section. The authors provide the following information:

1. **UCF101 Dataset**: This dataset consists of 13,320 videos categorized into 101 action classes. It is widely used for action recognition tasks.

2. **HMDB51 Dataset**: This dataset contains 7,000 videos across 51 action classes. It is another popular benchmark for evaluating action recognition algorithms.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **UCF101**, the citation is:
  > Khurram Soomro, Amir Roshan Zamir, and Mubarak Shah. *UCF101: A dataset of 101 human actions classes from videos in the wild*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1212.0402, 2012.

- For **HMDB51**, the citation is:
  > Hildegard Kuehne, Hueihan Jhuang, Estíbaliz Garrote, Tomaso Poggio, and Thomas Serre. *HMDB: a large video database for human motion recognition*. In 2011 International Conference on Computer Vision, pages 2556–2563, 2011.

Now that I have gathered all necessary information about the datasets, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
