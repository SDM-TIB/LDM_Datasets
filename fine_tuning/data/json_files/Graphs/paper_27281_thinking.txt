To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Syntactic Nuclei in Dependency Parsing – A Multilingual Exploration" by Ali Basirat and Joakim Nivre, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract discusses experiments on 12 languages, which suggests that there may be datasets involved, but I need to find specific names.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology or experiments sections**. In this paper, the authors refer to **Universal Dependencies (UD) treebanks** as the primary resource for their experiments. This indicates that UD treebanks are a significant dataset used in their research.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Universal Dependencies project. The relevant citation is:

- **Universal Dependencies (UD) v2.3**: 
  > Nivre, J., de Marneffe, M.-C., Ginter, F., Hajiˇc, J., Manning, C. D., Pyysalo, S., Schuster, F., Tyers, F., & Zeman, D. (2020). Universal Dependencies v2: An ever-growing multilingual treebank collection. In Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC).

Additionally, I will note that the paper mentions using **UD treebanks** for 12 different languages, which implies that there are multiple datasets involved, but they are all part of the larger UD collection.

Now, I will summarize the datasets identified:

1. **Universal Dependencies (UD) Treebanks**: A collection of cross-linguistically consistent morphosyntactic annotations for many languages, used for evaluating dependency parsing models.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research.
