To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Locally Adaptive Translation for Knowledge Graph Embedding" by Yantao Jia et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that experiments were conducted on two benchmark datasets, which indicates that specific datasets will be discussed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, where the authors detail the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they explicitly list the datasets as follows:

1. **WN18**: This dataset is derived from WordNet and is used for knowledge graph embedding tasks. The paper states that it contains 40,943 entities and 141,442 training triples.

2. **FB15K**: This dataset is from Freebase and is another benchmark for knowledge graph embedding. It includes 14,951 entities and 483,142 training triples.

3. **WN11**: Another dataset from WordNet, it has 38,696 entities and 112,581 training triples.

4. **FB13**: This dataset is also from Freebase, containing 75,043 entities and 316,232 training triples.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **WN18**, the citation is:
  > Bordes, A., Glorot, X., Weston, J., & Bengio, Y. (2014). A semantic matching energy function for learning with multi-relational data. *Machine Learning*, 94(2), 233–259.

- For **FB15K**, the citation is:
  > Bordes, A., Usunier, N., Garcia-Duran, A., Weston, J., & Yakhnenko, O. (2013). Translating embeddings for modeling multi-relational data. In *Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems* (pp. 2787–2795).

- For **WN11**, the citation is:
  > Socher, R., Chen, D., Manning, C. D., & Ng, A. (2013). Reasoning with neural tensor networks for knowledge base completion. In *Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems* (pp. 926–934).

- For **FB13**, the citation is:
  > Socher, R., Chen, D., Manning, C. D., & Ng, A. (2013). Reasoning with neural tensor networks for knowledge base completion. In *Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems* (pp. 926–934).

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured all necessary details regarding the datasets used in the research.
