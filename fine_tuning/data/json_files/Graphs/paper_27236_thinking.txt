To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Formalising Concepts as Grounded Abstractions" by Stephen Clark et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by scanning the **abstract and introduction** sections for any mentions of datasets. These sections often provide a high-level overview of the research and may explicitly state the datasets used or referenced.

Next, I will carefully examine the **methodology and experiments sections** of the paper. These sections typically contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used for training and evaluation. I will look for any specific dataset names, descriptions, and the context in which they are used.

If the paper includes a **dedicated section on datasets**, I will focus on that section to gather comprehensive details about each dataset. This may include information such as the number of samples, types of data, and any specific characteristics that are relevant to the research.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily.

For each dataset, I will note the following details:
1. **Dataset Name**: The official name of the dataset as mentioned in the paper.
2. **Description**: A brief description of the dataset, including its purpose and key features.
3. **Citation**: The full citation as provided in the references section of the paper.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile it into a structured format that clearly presents each dataset along with its citation. This will ensure that the information is organized and easily accessible for future reference or analysis.

By following these steps, I will ensure a thorough extraction of datasets from the paper while maintaining the importance of proper citation.
