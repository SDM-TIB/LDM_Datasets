To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Advanced Graph-Based Deep Learning for Probabilistic Type Inference" by Fangke Ye, Jisheng Zhao, and Vivek Sarkar, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract and introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used in the study.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any relevant subsections within the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors describe their dataset construction process in **section 4 (Evaluation)**, where they mention that they constructed their dataset based on a corpus of popular TypeScript projects from GitHub. They also detail how they split the dataset into training, validation, and test subsets.

In this section, the authors specify the following datasets:

1. **Training Set**: Contains 74,801 files from 789 TypeScript projects.
2. **Validation Set**: Contains 3,729 files from 99 TypeScript projects.
3. **Test Set**: Contains 3,838 files from 99 TypeScript projects.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for any datasets mentioned. However, in this case, the datasets are constructed from publicly available TypeScript projects, and the authors do not provide specific citations for individual datasets. Instead, they refer to the general corpus of TypeScript projects used for their evaluation.

Since the datasets are derived from a collection of projects rather than a single dataset with a formal citation, I will summarize the dataset information as follows:

- **Dataset Name**: TypeScript Projects Dataset
  - **Description**: A collection of TypeScript projects from GitHub used for training, validation, and testing the GNN-based type inference models.
  - **Training Set**: 74,801 files from 789 projects.
  - **Validation Set**: 3,729 files from 99 projects.
  - **Test Set**: 3,838 files from 99 projects.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and completeness, ensuring that I accurately represent the datasets as described in the paper.
