To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Proactive Robot Assistance via Spatio-Temporal Object Modeling" by Maithili Patel and Sonia Chernova, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any datasets that are introduced or referenced. The abstract mentions the **Household Object Movements from Everyday Routines (HOMER)** dataset, which is a clear indication that this dataset is significant to the research.

Next, I will delve into the **introduction** section, where the authors elaborate on their contributions. Here, they explicitly state that they are introducing the HOMER dataset, which tracks household objects associated with human activities across multiple days. This reinforces the importance of this dataset in their research.

I will then proceed to the **dataset generation** section, where the authors provide a detailed description of the HOMER dataset. They explain that it consists of routine behaviors for five households over a span of 50 days for training and 10 days for testing. The dataset is generated using the VirtualHome simulator, which models human behavior and object interactions. This section provides essential details about the dataset's structure and purpose.

In the **evaluation** section, the authors mention using the HOMER dataset to validate their predictive model. This further confirms the dataset's relevance to their experiments and findings.

Now, I will look at the **References** section to find the full citation for the HOMER dataset. The authors do not provide a separate citation for the dataset itself, but they mention that it is available at a specific GitHub repository. Therefore, I will use the following citation format for the dataset:

- **Household Object Movements from Everyday Routines (HOMER) Dataset**:
  > Maithili Patel and Sonia Chernova. *Household Object Movements from Everyday Routines (HOMER) Dataset*. Available at: https://github.com/GT-RAIL/rail_tasksim/tree/homer/routines.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entry for the HOMER dataset, ensuring that I include the full citation as required. This structured approach will help me accurately extract and document the dataset from the research paper.
