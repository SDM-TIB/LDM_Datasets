To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Program Classification Using Gated Graph Attention Neural Network for Online Programming Services" by Mingming Lu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental evaluation sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention the datasets used for evaluation. 

Next, I will focus on the **experimental evaluation section** (Section V), where the authors typically describe the datasets in detail. In this section, the authors mention that the experimental data are collected from an Online Judge (OJ) programming exercise system. They specify that the dataset consists of programming tasks and the corresponding source codes submitted by students. 

I will look for specific details about the datasets, such as the number of programming tasks, the programming languages considered, and any filtering criteria applied to the data. The authors mention that they filtered the data to include only programming tasks with more than 350 submitted codes, resulting in a total of 30 programming tasks. They also mention that they used C++ source codes for their analysis.

In the **dataset statistics table (Table I)**, I will extract the relevant information, including the number of graphs, nodes, edges, classes, and edge types for both the common and similarity datasets. This table provides a concise summary of the datasets used in the experiments.

Now, I will compile the full citations for the datasets mentioned in the paper. Since the authors did not provide specific citations for the datasets, I will create a general citation for the dataset based on the information provided in the paper:

1. **Online Judge Programming Exercise Dataset**: This dataset consists of programming tasks and corresponding source codes submitted by students in an online judge system. The dataset includes 30 programming tasks with a focus on C++ source codes.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited. This will facilitate further analysis or processing of the datasets mentioned in the research paper.
