To extract datasets from the research paper titled "3D-TOGO: Towards Text-Guided Cross-Category 3D Object Generation" by Zutao Jiang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments on the largest 3D object dataset, which suggests that a specific dataset is being utilized.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly the part where the authors describe their methodology and the datasets used. In this section, they explicitly mention the **Amazon-Berkeley Objects (ABO)** dataset, detailing its characteristics, such as containing nearly 8,000 real household objects from 98 categories, along with their corresponding natural language descriptions. This is a clear indication that the ABO dataset is central to their research.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the ABO dataset. The authors cite the following paper for the dataset:

- **ABO Dataset Citation**:
  > Collins, J., Goel, S., Deng, K., Luthra, A., Xu, L., Gundogdu, E., Zhang, X., Vicente, T. F. Y., Dideriksen, T., Arora, H., et al. (2022). *ABO: Dataset and benchmarks for real-world 3D object understanding*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 21126â€“21136.

After gathering this information, I will ensure that I have accurately documented the dataset's name, description, and full citation. 

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format for clarity and future reference. This will include the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation, ensuring that all necessary details are captured for anyone reviewing the research or utilizing the dataset in their work.
