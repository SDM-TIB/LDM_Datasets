To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Artificial Intelligence Powered Material Search Engine" by Divy Patel et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, but the methods section is likely where the datasets will be detailed.

In **section 2 (Methods)**, I will focus on **subsection 2.1 (Dataset)**, where the authors describe the dataset used for their experiments. They mention that they used a dataset of d-values for various materials, specifically naming materials such as Cesium Chloride, Calcium Borate, Bismuth Selenide, and others. The authors state that the d-values were primarily obtained from the **Inorganic Material Database**.

Next, I will confirm the details of the dataset, including the number of samples and the specific materials included. The authors indicate that they generated a dataset of 89 samples, which is crucial information for describing the dataset.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the **Inorganic Material Database**. The citation provided in the references is:

- **Inorganic Material Database**: 
  > The National Institute for Materials Science. *Inorganic material database (atomwork)*, 2010. Data retrieved from National Institute for Materials Science, https://crystdb.nims.go.jp/en/.

This citation is essential for properly attributing the source of the dataset.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will summarize the dataset as follows:

1. **Dataset Name**: Inorganic Material Database
   - **Description**: A dataset containing d-values for various materials, including Cesium Chloride, Calcium Borate, Bismuth Selenide, Lead, Cadmium Oxide, Selenium Oxide, Lead Oxide, Zinc Oxide, and Copper Sulfide. The dataset consists of 89 samples, with prominent d-values considered for each material.
   - **Full Citation**: The National Institute for Materials Science. *Inorganic material database (atomwork)*, 2010. Data retrieved from National Institute for Materials Science, https://crystdb.nims.go.jp/en/.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that the dataset is accurately represented with its full citation.
