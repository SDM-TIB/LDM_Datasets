To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Massively Multi-Cultural Knowledge Acquisition & LM Benchmarking on 1000+ Sub-Country Regions and 2000+ Ethnolinguistic Groups" by Yi R. Fung et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract introduces the **CultureAtlas dataset**, which is a key focus of the paper. This indicates that I should look for more details about this dataset in the subsequent sections.

Next, I will examine **section 2 (Benchmark Construction)**, where the authors describe the data collection process for the CultureAtlas dataset. They mention that this dataset includes positive and negative samples of cultural knowledge assertions, covering a wide range of sub-country geographical regions and ethnolinguistic groups. This section provides crucial details about the dataset's scope and purpose.

In **section 2.1 (Data Collection and Data Preprocessing)**, the authors elaborate on how they constructed the CultureAtlas dataset by collecting cultural knowledge from Wikipedia and other sources. They also mention the number of documents and cultural knowledge assertion sentences, which is important for understanding the dataset's scale.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the CultureAtlas dataset. Since this dataset is created by the authors themselves, I will cite it as follows:

- **CultureAtlas Dataset**:
  > Yi R. Fung, Ruining Zhao, Jae Doo Chen, Kai Sun, and Heng Ji. *Massively Multi-Cultural Knowledge Acquisition & LM Benchmarking on 1000+ Sub-Country Regions and 2000+ Ethnolinguistic Groups*. In Proceedings of the Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), 2023.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will summarize the dataset details, including its purpose, the types of data it contains, and its significance in the context of the research.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format that captures all the relevant information, ensuring that the full citation is included for proper attribution.
