To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The Devil is in the Conflict: Disentangled Information Graph Neural Networks For Fraud Detection" by Zhixun Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments on real-world fraud detection datasets, which indicates that specific datasets will be discussed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this case, they mention two datasets: 

1. **YelpChi Dataset**: This dataset is described as collecting hotel and restaurant reviews from Yelp.com, containing 45,954 nodes (with 14.53% labeled as fraud) and various relationships among the reviews.

2. **Amazon Dataset**: This dataset includes product reviews from the Musical Instrument category, with 11,944 nodes (6.87% labeled as fraud) and multiple relationships among users based on their reviews.

I will also check the **statistics table** (Table I) provided in the experiments section for additional details about the datasets, such as the number of edges and classes.

After identifying the datasets, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **YelpChi Dataset**, the citation is:
  > S. Rayana and L. Akoglu, “Collective opinion spam detection: Bridging review networks and metadata,” in Proceedings of the 21st ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, 2015, pp. 985–994.

- For the **Amazon Dataset**, the citation is:
  > J. J. McAuley and J. Leskovec, “From amateurs to connoisseurs: modeling the evolution of user expertise through online reviews,” in Proceedings of the 22nd International Conference on World Wide Web, 2013, pp. 897–908.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
