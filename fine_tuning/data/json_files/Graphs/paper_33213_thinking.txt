To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Language Semantic Graph Guided Data-Efficient Learning" by Wenxuan Ma et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that experiments were conducted across various modalities, which suggests that multiple datasets may be involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4), where the authors typically provide detailed information about the datasets used. In this section, they explicitly list the datasets employed for their experiments, which is crucial for my extraction process.

Upon reviewing the experiments section, I find the following datasets mentioned:

1. **FGVC Aircraft**: This dataset is described as containing 10,000 images for 100 aircraft variants, split into training and testing sets.
2. **Stanford Cars**: This dataset consists of 16,185 images across 196 classes of cars, also split into training and testing sets.
3. **CUB-200-2011**: This dataset includes 11,788 images of 200 bird species, with a specified training and testing split.
4. **Office-Home**: A dataset for domain adaptation containing images from four domains, each with roughly 4,000 images across 65 categories.
5. **UCF-101**: This dataset comprises 13,320 videos across 101 action categories.
6. **HMDB51**: A collection of 6,766 video clips from 51 action categories.
7. **AudioSet-20K**: An audio event dataset with over 2 million human-annotated clips, with a specific subset referenced for experiments.

Next, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for each dataset. This is essential for proper attribution and to ensure that the datasets can be easily located by others.

The citations I find are as follows:

- **FGVC Aircraft**:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This structured approach will help in accurately documenting the datasets used in the research paper.
