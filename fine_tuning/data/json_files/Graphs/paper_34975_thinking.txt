To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Data-Driven Radio Environment Map Estimation Using Graph Neural Networks" by Ali Shibli and Tahar Zanouda, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and data sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the use of "sparse geo-located signal strength measurements," which indicates that there is a dataset involved.

Next, I will focus on **section III (Data)**, where the authors describe the dataset used for their experiments. They mention that the dataset spans 8 weeks and is collected from 2 cities, containing attributes such as global cell identifier, signal strength measurement values, timestamps, and geographical coordinates. This section provides a clear description of the dataset's characteristics.

The authors also mention that the dataset includes measurements from over 1000 deployed Radio Nodes and that it can be collected using the Minimization of Drive Tests (MDT) feature. This information is crucial for understanding the dataset's context and application.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. However, the paper does not provide a specific citation for the dataset itself, as it appears to be a proprietary or internal dataset collected by the authors or their organization. Therefore, I will note that the dataset is based on real-world measurements but lacks a formal citation.

Since the dataset is not formally cited in the references, I will summarize the dataset details as follows:

1. **Dataset Name**: Geo-located Signal Strength Measurements
   - **Description**: This dataset spans 8 weeks and includes signal strength measurements collected from two cities. Each data point contains attributes such as global cell identifier, signal strength measurement values, timestamps, and geographical coordinates (longitude and latitude). The dataset covers over 1000 deployed Radio Nodes and is collected using the Minimization of Drive Tests (MDT) feature.
   - **Citation**: Not formally cited; internal dataset based on real-world measurements.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format for further processing or review.
