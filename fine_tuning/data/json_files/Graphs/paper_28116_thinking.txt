To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Earables for Detection of Bruxism: a Feasibility Study" by Erika Bondareva et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study involves detecting bruxism-related events using earables, which suggests that data collection is a key component of the research.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors discuss the need for unobtrusive methods for bruxism detection. They mention collecting data from participants, which implies that a dataset has been created as part of this study.

In the **methodology section**, the authors provide detailed information about the data collection process. They state that they collected IMU (inertial measurement unit) data from 17 participants using eSense wireless earbuds. This data includes both accelerometer and gyroscope readings, which are crucial for the detection of teeth grinding and clenching.

The authors also mention that the dataset consists of data collected in both controlled environments and while participants performed routine activities to simulate real-world conditions. This indicates that the dataset is comprehensive and includes various scenarios.

I will now look for specific details about the dataset, such as its name, the number of participants, the types of data collected, and any unique characteristics. The authors explicitly state that they compiled a novel dataset of teeth grinding and clenching data collected through earables from 13 participants, which is a significant detail.

Next, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets or related works mentioned. However, since this dataset is novel and created by the authors themselves, it may not have an external citation. Instead, I will cite the paper itself as the source of the dataset.

The citation for the dataset will be:
> Bondareva, E., Hauksdóttir, E. R., & Mascolo, C. (2021). Earables for Detection of Bruxism: a Feasibility Study. In EarComp ’21: 2nd International Workshop on Earable Computing, Sep 25, 2021, online. ACM, New York, NY, USA, 6 pages. https://doi.org/10.1145/1122445.1122456

Now, I will summarize the dataset information:
1. **Dataset Name**: Bruxism Detection Dataset
2. **Description**: A dataset containing teeth grinding and clenching data collected from 13 participants using eSense wireless earbuds, including data from both controlled environments and simulated in-the-wild activities.
3. **Data Types**: IMU data (accelerometer and gyroscope readings).
4. **Number of Participants**: 13
5. **Unique Characteristics**: Data collected in both noise-free environments and while performing routine activities.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
