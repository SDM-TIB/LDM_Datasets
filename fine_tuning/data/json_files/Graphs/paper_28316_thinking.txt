To extract datasets from the research paper titled "HyperExpan: Taxonomy Expansion with Hyperbolic Representation Learning" by Mingyu Derek Ma et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on taxonomy expansion benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors detail their evaluation setup. Here, they explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments:

1. **WordNet-Verb**: This dataset consists of 13,936 nodes and 13,408 edges, with a maximum depth of 13. It is a well-known lexical database for the English language, where words are grouped into sets of synonyms called synsets.

2. **WordNet-Noun**: Similar to WordNet-Verb, this dataset contains 83,073 nodes and 76,812 edges, with a maximum depth of 20. It focuses on noun synsets within the WordNet framework.

3. **MAG-PSY**: This dataset is a subgraph of the Microsoft Academic Graph, specifically focusing on the field of psychology. It contains 23,187 nodes and 30,041 edges, with a maximum depth of 6.

4. **MAG-CS**: Another subgraph from the Microsoft Academic Graph, this dataset pertains to computer science and includes 24,754 nodes and 42,329 edges, also with a maximum depth of 6.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The paper does not provide explicit citations for the datasets, but I can infer the following based on common knowledge:

- For **WordNet**, the citation is:
  > George A. Miller. *WordNet: A Lexical Database for English*. Communications of the ACM, 38(11):39-41, 1995.

- For **Microsoft Academic Graph**, the citation is:
  > Sinha, A., Shen, Z., Song, Y., Ma, H., Eide, D., Hsu, B.-J., & Wang, K. (2015). *An Overview of Microsoft Academic Service (MAS) and Applications*. In Proceedings of the 24th International Conference on World Wide Web (WWW), pages 243-246.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture the necessary information for each dataset mentioned in the paper.
