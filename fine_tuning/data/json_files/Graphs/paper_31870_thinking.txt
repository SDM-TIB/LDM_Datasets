To extract datasets from the research paper titled "GCNSLIM: Graph Convolutional Network with Sparse Linear Methods for E-government Service Recommendation" by Lingyuan Kong et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on a "real e-government service dataset" and a "common public dataset," which suggests that there are specific datasets used in their research.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Dataset Description)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention:

1. **Wuhou Dataset**: This dataset is derived from the Wuhou District Administrative Approval Bureau in Chengdu, containing over 4 million records from more than 60,000 citizens interacting with over 500 government services from October 2015 to August 2019. The dataset includes user ID, gender, age, item ID, and timestamp.

2. **Movielens-1M Dataset**: This is a commonly used public dataset for recommendation systems, which includes interactions with ratings no less than 3, and the authors apply a 10-core setting to ensure each user and item has at least 10 interactions.

I will then verify the details of these datasets in the **experiments section** to confirm their usage in the experiments. The authors explicitly state that they conducted extensive experiments on both the Wuhou dataset and the Movielens-1M dataset, confirming their relevance.

Now, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Wuhou Dataset**, since it is a specific dataset from a governmental source, I will cite it as follows:
  > Wuhou District Administrative Approval Bureau. *Open Data for E-Government Services*. Chengdu, China. Available at: http://gk.chengdu.gov.cn/openApply/

- For the **Movielens-1M Dataset**, the citation is:
  > F. Maxwell Harper and Joseph A. Konstan. *The MovieLens Datasets: History and Context*. ACM Transactions on Interactive Intelligent Systems, 5(4), 2015.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all details are accurately represented for future reference or processing.
