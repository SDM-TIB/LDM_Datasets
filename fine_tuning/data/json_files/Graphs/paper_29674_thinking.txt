To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Can Hybrid Geometric Scattering Networks Help Solve the Maximum Clique Problem?" by Yimeng Min et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their method on "three popular real-world graph learning datasets," which indicates that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.2 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for evaluation. They mention:

1. **IMDB Dataset**: A dataset used for graph learning, specifically for evaluating the maximum clique problem.
2. **COLLAB Dataset**: Another graph learning dataset that is commonly used in the literature.
3. **TWITTER Dataset**: A dataset that consists of graphs derived from Twitter data, also used for evaluating the proposed method.
4. **SMALL Dataset**: A newly introduced dataset containing graphs generated according to a specific approach, with subclasses of easy, medium, and hard difficulties.
5. **LARGE Dataset**: Another new dataset with larger graphs, also containing subclasses of easy, medium, and hard difficulties.

In the **results section**, the authors provide performance metrics for their model on these datasets, confirming their relevance and usage in the experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets mentioned are as follows:

- For the **IMDB Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yanardag, P., & Vishwanathan, S. V. N. (2015). Deep graph kernels. In Proceedings of the 21st ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (pp. 1365-1374).

- For the **COLLAB Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yanardag, P., & Vishwanathan, S. V. N. (2015). Deep graph kernels. In Proceedings of the 21st ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (pp. 1365-1374).

- For the **TWITTER Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yan, X., Cheng, H., Han, J., & Yu, P. S. (2008). Mining significant graph patterns by leap search. In Proceedings of the 2008 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data (pp. 433-444).

- For the **SMALL and LARGE Datasets**, the authors reference the methodology of Xu et al. (2005) for generating these datasets:
  > Xu, K., Boussemart, F., Hemery, F., & Lecoutre, C. (2005). A simple model to generate hard satisfiable instances. In Proceedings of the 19th International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (pp. 337-342).

With this information, I can now compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
