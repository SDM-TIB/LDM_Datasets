To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ESCL: Equivariant Self-Contrastive Learning for Sentence Representations" by Jie Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, but I will focus on the sections that are likely to contain specific dataset information.

In **section 4.2 (The Datasets)**, the authors explicitly mention that they use the **SentEval toolkit** to evaluate their method on **7 semantic textual similarity (STS) tasks**. This indicates that there are datasets associated with these tasks that I need to identify.

Next, I will look for the specific datasets mentioned in this section. The authors list the following datasets:

1. **STS 2012**: A dataset for semantic textual similarity evaluation.
2. **STS 2013**: Another dataset for semantic textual similarity evaluation.
3. **STS 2014**: Continuing the series of datasets for semantic textual similarity.
4. **STS 2015**: Yet another dataset in the STS series.
5. **STS 2016**: The final dataset in the STS series mentioned.
6. **STS Benchmark**: A benchmark dataset for evaluating semantic textual similarity.
7. **SICK-Relatedness**: A dataset used for evaluating relatedness in sentences.

In the **References section**, I will look for full citations for these datasets. The citations for the STS datasets and the SICK dataset are typically found in the references, and I will ensure to extract them accurately.

The citations I will retrieve are:

- For **STS 2012**:
  > Eneko Agirre, Carmen Banea, Daniel Cer, Mona Diab, Aitor Gonzalez-Agirre, Rada Mihalcea, German Rigau, and Janyce Wiebe. *SemEval-2016 task 1: Semantic textual similarity, monolingual and cross-lingual evaluation*. In SemEval, 2016.

- For **STS 2013**:
  > Daniel Cer, Mona Diab, Eneko Agirre, Iñigo Lopez-Gazpio, and Lucia Specia. *SemEval-2017 task 1: Semantic textual similarity multilingual and crosslingual focused evaluation*. In SemEval, 2017.

- For **STS 2014**:
  > Marco Marelli, Stefano Menini, Marco Baroni, Luisa Bentivogli, Raffaella Bernardi, and Roberto Zamparelli. *A SICK cure for the evaluation of compositional distributional semantic models*. In LREC, 2014.

- For **STS 2015**:
  > Daniel Cer, Mona Diab, Eneko Agirre, Iñigo Lopez-Gazpio, and Lucia Specia. *SemEval-2017 task 1: Semantic textual similarity multilingual and crosslingual focused evaluation*. In SemEval, 2017.

- For **STS 2016**:
  > Eneko Agirre, Carmen Banea, Daniel Cer, Mona Diab, Aitor Gonzalez-Agirre, Rada Mihalcea, German Rigau, and Janyce Wiebe. *SemEval-2016 task 1: Semantic textual similarity, monolingual and cross-lingual evaluation*. In SemEval, 2016.

- For **STS Benchmark**:
  > Daniel Cer, Mona Diab, Eneko Agirre, Iñigo Lopez-Gazpio, and Lucia Specia. *SemEval-2017 task 1: Semantic textual similarity multilingual and crosslingual focused evaluation*. In SemEval, 2017.

- For **SICK-Relatedness**:
  > Marco Marelli, Stefano Menini, Marco Baroni, Luisa Bentivogli, Raffaella Bernardi, and Roberto Zamparelli. *A SICK cure for the evaluation of compositional distributional semantic models*. In LREC, 2014.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and that the full citations are included. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
