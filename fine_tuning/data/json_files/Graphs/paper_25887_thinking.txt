To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-Model Hypothesize-and-Verify Approach for Incremental Loop Closure Verification" by Tanaka Kanji, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the proposed framework for loop closure detection but does not specify any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the body of the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section III) where the author describes the experimental setup. Here, the author mentions conducting experiments using a stereo SLAM system on a university campus and collecting three sequences of stereo images. The lengths of these sequences are provided, which indicates that they are part of the dataset used for the experiments.

I will extract the following details about the datasets:

1. **Dataset of Stereo Image Sequences**: The paper states that three sequences were collected along routes with travel distances of 756 m, 657 m, and 401 m. The lengths of the sequences are 1651, 1621, and 979 images, respectively. This dataset is crucial for the experiments conducted in the paper.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find any citations related to the datasets mentioned. However, the paper does not provide a specific citation for the dataset of stereo image sequences, as it appears to be a custom dataset collected by the authors for their experiments.

Since there are no external datasets cited in the references, I will note that the dataset is an original collection by the authors and does not have a formal citation.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring to include the dataset description and the lack of a formal citation.

In summary, the dataset extracted from the paper is as follows:

- **Dataset Name**: Stereo Image Sequences
- **Description**: Three sequences collected along routes with travel distances of 756 m, 657 m, and 401 m, containing 1651, 1621, and 979 images, respectively.
- **Citation**: No formal citation available; dataset is original to the authors.

With this information, I will prepare the dataset entry for further processing.
