To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Infusing Knowledge into the Textual Entailment Task Using Graph Convolutional Networks" by Pavan Kapanipathi et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their approach on multiple textual entailment datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments & Results)**, particularly **subsection 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they mention:

1. **SNLI (Stanford Natural Language Inference)**: A widely used dataset for natural language inference tasks, consisting of sentence pairs labeled with entailment, contradiction, or neutrality.
2. **SciTail**: A dataset derived from science question answering, specifically designed for textual entailment tasks.
3. **MultiNLI (Multi-Genre Natural Language Inference)**: A dataset that covers a wide range of topics and genres, also used for evaluating natural language inference models.
4. **BreakingNLI**: An adversarial dataset designed to challenge existing NLI models, focusing on simple lexical inferences.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **SNLI**, the citation is:
  > Bowman, S. R., Angeli, G., Potts, C., & Manning, C. D. (2015). A large annotated corpus for learning natural language inference. In Proceedings of Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing Conference, 632–642.

- For **SciTail**, the citation is:
  > Khot, T., Sabharwal, A., & Clark, P. (2018). SciTail: A textual entailment dataset from science question answering. In Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence.

- For **MultiNLI**, the citation is:
  > Williams, A., Nangia, N., & Bowman, S. (2018). A broad-coverage challenge corpus for sentence understanding through inference. In Proceedings of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics Conference: Human Language Technologies, Volume 1, 1112–1122.

- For **BreakingNLI**, the citation is:
  > Glockner, M., Shwartz, V., & Goldberg, Y. (2018). Breaking NLI systems with sentences that require simple lexical inferences. In Proceedings of the 56th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 2: Short Papers), 650–655.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
