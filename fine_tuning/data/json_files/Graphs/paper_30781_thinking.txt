To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Realtime Few-shot Portrait Stylization Based On Geometric Alignment" by Xinrui Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiment sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the method is trained on various artistic styles, which suggests that datasets are involved. The introduction discusses the challenges of stylization and hints at the use of datasets for training.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiment)**, where the authors provide details about the datasets used for training their stylization network. Here, they mention:

1. **FFHQ Dataset**: This dataset consists of 10,000 images of human faces, which are cropped and resized for the portrait data.
2. **Wikiart Dataset**: Specifically for the oil paint style, the authors collected 300 facial images from this dataset.
3. **Additional Style Datasets**: They also mention collecting 820 images for animation style, 64 images for watercolor style, and 34 images for ink paint style.

Now, I will verify these datasets by checking the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

- For the **FFHQ Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Tero Karras, Samuli Laine, and Timo Aila. *A style-based generator architecture for generative adversarial networks*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pages 4401â€“4410, 2019.

- For the **Wikiart Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Kiri Nichol. *Painter by numbers, wikiart*. Kiri Nichol, 2016.

- The additional datasets (animation, watercolor, and ink paint styles) are not explicitly cited in the references, but they are mentioned in the context of the experiments. I will note that these datasets are collected by the authors for their specific study.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described accurately along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for any further processing or review.
