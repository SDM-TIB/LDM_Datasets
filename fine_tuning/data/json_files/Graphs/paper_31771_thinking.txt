To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Detecting Novelties with Empty Classes" by Svenja Uhlemeyer et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss their method and mention that they conduct experiments on several datasets, including **MNIST**, **FashionMNIST**, **CIFAR10**, **Animals10**, and **Cityscapes**. This indicates that these datasets are likely to be important for the experiments described later in the paper.

Next, I will look at the **experiments section** where the authors detail their methodology and the specific datasets used for their experiments. They mention the following datasets:

1. **MNIST**: The authors state that they use the MNIST dataset for image classification, specifically excluding certain classes (0, 5, and 7) as novel classes.

2. **FashionMNIST**: Similar to MNIST, they use FashionMNIST, excluding classes (1 and 8) as novel classes.

3. **CIFAR10**: The CIFAR10 dataset is used, with the authors extending the test data by adding classes (10 and 11) as novel classes.

4. **Animals10**: This dataset is mentioned, with classes (3, 4, 8, and 9) being selected as novel classes.

5. **Cityscapes**: The authors adapt their method for semantic segmentation using the Cityscapes dataset, excluding certain classes for evaluation.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are typically formatted in a standard way, and I will ensure to extract the necessary details for each dataset.

- For **MNIST**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun, Léon Bottou, Yoshua Bengio, and Patrick Haffner. *Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition*. Proc. IEEE, 86:2278–2324, 1998.

- For **FashionMNIST**, the citation is:
  > Han Xiao, Kashif Rasul, and Roland Vollgraf. *Fashion-MNIST: A novel image dataset for benchmarking machine learning algorithms*. ArXiv, abs/1708.07747, 2017.

- For **CIFAR10**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. 2009.

- For **Animals10**, the citation is:
  > Alessio Corrado. *Animals10 Dataset*. Available at: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alessiocorrado99/animals10.

- For **Cityscapes**, the citation is:
  > Marius Cordts, Mohamed Omran, Sebastian Ramos, Timo Rehfeld, Markus Enzweiler, Rodrigo Benenson, Uwe Franke, Stefan Roth, and Bernt Schiele. *The cityscapes dataset for semantic urban scene understanding*. 2016 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 3213–3223, 2016.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This structured approach will help in accurately documenting the datasets used in the research paper.
