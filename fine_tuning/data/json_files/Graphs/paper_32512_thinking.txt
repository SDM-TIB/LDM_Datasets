To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Decoupled Contrastive Multi-View Clustering with High-Order Random Walks" by Yiding Lu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant details, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets, which indicates that specific datasets will be discussed later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors explicitly list the datasets used for evaluation in the **experimental setup** section. Here, they mention four datasets:

1. **Scene-15**: This dataset contains 4,485 images of 15 scene categories. The authors reference the original source as "Li and Perona 2005."

2. **Caltech-101**: This dataset consists of 8,677 images of objects from 101 classes, with a reference to "Li et al. 2015."

3. **Reuters**: A multilingual news dataset with 18,758 samples, referenced as "Amini, Usunier, and Goutte 2009."

4. **LandUse-21**: This dataset includes 2,100 satellite images from 21 classes, with a citation to "Yang and Newsam 2010."

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to retrieve the full citations for each dataset:

- For **Scene-15**, the citation is:
  > Li, F., & Perona, P. (2005). A bayesian hierarchical model for learning natural scene categories. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 524–531.

- For **Caltech-101**, the citation is:
  > Li, Y., Li, M., Tang, C., Xia, J., Xiong, J., Liu, L., Kloft, M., & Zhu, E. (2015). Large-Scale Multi-View Spectral Clustering via Bipartite Graph. In Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, 2750–2756.

- For **Reuters**, the citation is:
  > Amini, M. R., Usunier, N., & Goutte, C. (2009). Learning from multiple partially observed views-an application to multilingual text categorization. Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 22.

- For **LandUse-21**, the citation is:
  > Yang, Y., & Newsam, S. (2010). Bag-of-visual-words and spatial extensions for land-use classification. In Proceedings of the ACM SIGSPATIAL International Conference on Advances in Geographic Information Systems, 270–279.

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will prepare to format this information according to the required structure for further processing or review.
