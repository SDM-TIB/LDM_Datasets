To extract datasets from the research paper titled "NeutronStream: A Dynamic GNN Training Framework with Sliding Window for Graph Streams" by Chaoyi Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their framework on several datasets, which indicates that there are datasets to be found. I will look for specific names or descriptions of these datasets.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (section 6) closely, as this is typically where datasets are detailed. In this section, the authors explicitly list six datasets used in their experiments:

1. **Social Evolution**: A dataset representing social interactions, with 84 nodes and 575 initial edges.
2. **Github**: A dataset representing interactions on the Github platform, with 284 nodes and 794 initial edges.
3. **DNC**: A communication network dataset with 2,029 nodes and no initial edges.
4. **UCI**: Another communication network dataset with 1,899 nodes and no initial edges.
5. **Reality**: A dataset with 6,809 nodes and 54,369 initial edges.
6. **Slashdot**: A dataset with 51,083 nodes and 131,175 initial edges.

I will also check the **references section** to find full citations for these datasets. The paper cites the following sources for the datasets:

- For **Social Evolution**, the citation is:
  > Anmol Madan, Manuel Cebrian, Sai Moturu, Katayoun Farrahi, et al. *Sensing the "health state" of a community*. IEEE Pervasive Computing, 11(4): 36-45, 2011.

- For **Github**, the citation is:
  > GitHub Archive. *https://www.gharchive.org/*.

- For **DNC**, the citation is:
  > Jérôme Kunegis. *KONECT: The Koblenz Network Collection*. In Proceedings of the 22nd International Conference on World Wide Web (WWW ’13 Companion), 2013.

- For **UCI**, the citation is:
  > UCI Machine Learning Repository. *https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php*.

- For **Reality**, the citation is:
  > Natha1n Eagle and Alex Pentland. *Reality mining: sensing complex social systems*. Personal and Ubiquitous Computing, 10(4): 255-268, 2006.

- For **Slashdot**, the citation is:
  > Vicenç Gómez, Andreas Kaltenbrunner, and Vicente López. *Statistical analysis of the social network and discussion threads in Slashdot*. In Proceedings of the 17th International Conference on World Wide Web, 2008.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes the full citation as required. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details or datasets mentioned in the paper.
