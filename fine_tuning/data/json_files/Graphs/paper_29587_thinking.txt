To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SHARP: Shape-Aware Reconstruction of People in Loose Clothing" by Sai Sagar Jinka et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract states that the authors evaluate their method on "3DHumans and other publicly available datasets," which indicates that at least one dataset is named.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (3DHumans Dataset)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the dataset they created. They mention that "3DHumans" is a dataset of around 250 scans containing people in diverse body shapes and various garment styles. This section will provide essential details about the dataset, including its purpose, the number of subjects, and the technology used for capturing the data.

In this section, I will note the following key points about the **3DHumans dataset**:
- It contains approximately 250 scans of individuals in various clothing styles.
- The dataset includes around 150 male and 50 female subjects.
- It was created using a structured-light scanner with high accuracy and resolution.
- The dataset will be released in the public domain for academic use.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the **3DHumans dataset**. The authors mention that the dataset will be available at a specific URL, which I will include in the citation.

Next, I will look for any other datasets mentioned in the paper, particularly in the **Experiments & Results** section. The authors refer to several publicly available datasets, including **CLOTH3D**, **THUman1.0**, and **THUman2.0**. I will extract the relevant details for each of these datasets as well.

For **CLOTH3D**, I will note:
- It consists of 6500 synthetic sequences of SMPL meshes with garments draped onto them.
- The dataset includes a variety of garment styles.

For **THUman1.0**, I will note:
- It consists of 6800 human meshes registered with SMPL body in varying poses and garments.

For **THUman2.0**, I will note:
- It contains 500 high-quality 3D scans captured using a dense DSLR rig.

I will then find the full citations for these datasets in the References section as well.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as follows:

Finally, I will ensure that all extracted information is organized and ready for downstream processing or review.
