To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Adversarially Robust Signed Graph Contrastive Learning from Balance Augmentation" by Jialong Zhou et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model on various datasets, which indicates that datasets are likely discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 7), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. Here, I will look for specific mentions of datasets, including their names and any relevant statistics or descriptions.

In this section, the authors explicitly mention four datasets used in their experiments:

1. **Bitcoin-Alpha**: A dataset collected from Bitcoin trading platforms, consisting of 3,784 nodes and 22,650 positive edges.
2. **Bitcoin-OTC**: Another dataset from Bitcoin trading platforms, with 5,901 nodes and 32,029 positive edges.
3. **Slashdot**: A dataset from a technology news website, containing 33,586 nodes and 295,201 positive edges.
4. **Epinions**: An online social network dataset with 16,992 nodes and 276,309 positive edges.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The paper cites the following works for the datasets:

- For **Bitcoin-Alpha** and **Bitcoin-OTC**, the citation is:
  > Kumar, S., Spezzano, F., Subrahmanian, V. S., & Faloutsos, C. (2016). Edge weight prediction in weighted signed networks. In Proceedings of the 16th International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM), pages 221–230. IEEE.

- For **Slashdot**, the citation is:
  > Guha, R., Kumar, R., Raghavan, P., & Tomkins, A. (2004). Propagation of trust and distrust. In Proceedings of the 13th international conference on World Wide Web, pages 403–412.

- For **Epinions**, the citation is:
  > Guha, R., Kumar, R., Raghavan, P., & Tomkins, A. (2004). Propagation of trust and distrust. In Proceedings of the 13th international conference on World Wide Web, pages 403–412.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. This includes ensuring that each dataset is clearly described with its corresponding citation, which is crucial for proper attribution in any downstream applications or analyses.
