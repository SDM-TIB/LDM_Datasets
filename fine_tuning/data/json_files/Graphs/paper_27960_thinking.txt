To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CLDA: Contrastive Learning for Semi-Supervised Domain Adaptation" by Ankit Singh, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. In the abstract, the authors mention that their experiments were conducted on three well-known domain adaptation benchmark datasets: **DomainNet**, **Office-Home**, and **Office31**. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for understanding the context of the research.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used. In section 4.1, they explicitly list the datasets:

1. **DomainNet**: The authors describe it as a large-scale domain adaptation dataset with 345 classes across 6 domains. They mention using a subset containing 126 categories across four domains: Real (R), Clipart (C), Sketch (S), and Painting (P).

2. **Office-Home**: This dataset is noted as a widely used domain adaptation benchmark with 65 classes across four domains: Art (Ar), Product (Pr), Clipart (Cl), and Real (Rl).

3. **Office31**: This dataset is described as a smaller dataset containing 31 categories of data across three domains: Amazon (A), DSLR (D), and Webcam (W).

In the **references section**, I will look for the full citations for these datasets. The authors typically cite the original papers or sources where these datasets were introduced or described. 

For **DomainNet**, the citation is:
> Xingchao Peng, Qinxun Bai, Xide Xia, Zijun Huang, Kate Saenko, and Bo Wang. *Moment Matching for Multi-Source Domain Adaptation*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2019.

For **Office-Home**, the citation is:
> Venkateswara Hemanth, Eusebio Jose, Chakraborty Shayok, and Panchanathan Sethuraman. *Deep Hashing Network for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2017.

For **Office31**, the citation is:
> Kate Saenko, Brian Kulis, Mario Fritz, and Trevor Darrell. *Adapting Visual Category Models to New Domains*. In European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), 2010.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset along with its citation. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the necessary details for each dataset mentioned in the paper.
