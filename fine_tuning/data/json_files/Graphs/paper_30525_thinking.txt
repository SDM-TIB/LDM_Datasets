To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fusing Modalities by Multiplexed Graph Neural Networks for Outcome Prediction in Tuberculosis" by Niharika S. Dâ€™Souza et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors present results on a large Tuberculosis (TB) dataset, which suggests that there is a specific dataset being used for their experiments.

Next, I will examine **section 3.1 (Data and Experimental Setup)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset used in their experiments. Here, they mention that they conducted experiments using the **Tuberculosis Data Exploration Portal**, which includes data from **3051 patients** with five classes of treatment outcomes. This section is crucial as it outlines the modalities available, including demographic, clinical, genomic, and imaging data.

The authors specify that the dataset includes:
- **Demographic data**
- **Clinical data**
- **Regimen data**
- **Genomic data**: Specifically, they mention using **81 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)** related to drug resistance and raw genome sequences from **275 patients**.
- **Imaging data**: Chest CTs are available for **1015 patients**, with features extracted using a pre-trained DenseNet model.

In addition, I will look at the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The authors reference the **Tuberculosis Data Exploration Portal** in reference [7], which is essential for providing the complete citation.

The citation for the **Tuberculosis Data Exploration Portal** is:
> Gabrielian, A., Engle, E., Harris, M., Wollenberg, K., Juarez-Espinosa, O., Glogowski, A., Long, A., Patti, L., Hurt, D.E., Rosenthal, A., Tartakovsky, M. (2019). *Tb depot (data exploration portal): A multi-domain tuberculosis data analysis resource*. PLOS ONE, 14(5), e0217410. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0217410

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and full citation for each dataset identified in the paper. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.
