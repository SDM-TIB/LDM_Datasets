To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Linear-Time Graph Neural Networks for Scalable Recommendations" by Jiahao Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for experiments or evaluations.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4), as this is typically where authors describe the datasets they used for their evaluations. In this section, the authors mention that they conducted experiments on three real-world recommendation datasets. I will look for specific names and details of these datasets.

Upon reviewing the experiments section, I find the following datasets mentioned:

1. **Yelp2018 Dataset**: This dataset is used for evaluating the proposed model. It consists of user-item interactions from the Yelp platform.

2. **Alibaba-iFashion Dataset**: Another dataset used in the experiments, which contains user-item interactions from the Alibaba platform.

3. **Amazon-Large Dataset**: This dataset is constructed from the Amazon Review Data, specifically focusing on three large subsets (Books, Clothing Shoes and Jewelry, Home and Kitchen) to create a large-scale user-item interaction dataset.

Next, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

- For the **Yelp2018 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yifan Hu, Yehuda Koren, and Chris Volinsky. *Collaborative Filtering for Implicit Feedback Datasets*. In Proceedings of the 2008 Eighth IEEE International Conference on Data Mining, pages 263–272, 2008.

- For the **Alibaba-iFashion Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Xiang Wang, Xiangnan He, Meng Wang, Fuli Feng, and Tat-Seng Chua. *Neural Graph Collaborative Filtering*. In Proceedings of the 42nd International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval, pages 165–174, 2019.

- For the **Amazon-Large Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Julian McAuley and J. Leskovec. *Learning to Rank with Collaborative Filtering*. In Proceedings of the 7th ACM Conference on Recommender Systems, pages 7–14, 2013.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference.

In summary, I have extracted the following datasets from the paper:

1. **Yelp2018 Dataset**
   - Citation: Yifan Hu, Yehuda Koren, and Chris Volinsky. *Collaborative Filtering for Implicit Feedback Datasets*. In Proceedings of the 2008 Eighth IEEE International Conference on Data Mining, pages 263–272, 2008.

2. **Alibaba-iFashion Dataset**
   - Citation: Xiang Wang, Xiangnan He, Meng Wang, Fuli Feng, and Tat-Seng Chua. *Neural Graph Collaborative Filtering*. In Proceedings of the 42nd International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval, pages 165–174, 2019.

3. **Amazon-Large Dataset**
   - Citation: Julian McAuley and J. Leskovec. *Learning to Rank with Collaborative Filtering*. In Proceedings of the 7th ACM Conference on Recommender Systems, pages 7–14, 2013.

With this information, I am now ready to present the dataset entries in the required format.
