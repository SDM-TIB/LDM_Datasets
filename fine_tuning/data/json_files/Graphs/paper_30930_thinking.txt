To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Similarity Contrastive Estimation for Image and Video Soft Contrastive Self-Supervised Learning" by Julien Denize et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the datasets referenced. The abstract mentions that the authors validate their approach on various datasets, which indicates that there are specific datasets used in their experiments.

Next, I will look for explicit mentions of datasets in the **methodology** and **experiments** sections. In these sections, the authors typically describe the datasets used for training and evaluation. I will pay close attention to any tables or figures that may summarize the datasets, as they often contain important details.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find the following datasets mentioned:

1. **ImageNet**: A large-scale dataset used for image classification, consisting of 1,000 classes and approximately 1.3 million images in the training set.

2. **Kinetics400**: A dataset for action recognition in videos, containing 400 action classes with around 216,000 video clips.

3. **UCF101**: A dataset for action recognition containing 13,320 videos across 101 action categories.
   - Citation: Soomro, K., Zamir, A. R., & Shah, M. (2012). *UCF101: A dataset of 101 human actions classes from videos in the wild*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1212.0402.

4. **HMDB51**: A dataset consisting of 6,766 videos from 51 action categories.

5. **Something-Something V2 (SSv2)**: A dataset for human-object interactions, containing 169,000 training and 25,000 validation videos across 174 classes.
   - Citation: Goyal, R., Kahou, S. E., Michalski, V., et al. (2017). *The “Something Something” video database for learning and evaluating visual common sense*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 5843–5851. https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2017.622.

6. **AVA (v2.2)**: A dataset for spatiotemporal localization of human actions, consisting of 211,000 training videos and 57,000 validation videos for 60 classes.
   - Citation: Gu, C., Sun, C., Ross, D. A., et al. (2018). *AVA: A video dataset of spatio-temporally localized atomic visual actions*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 6047–6056. https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2018.00633.

After identifying these datasets, I will ensure to document their full citations accurately, as they are crucial for referencing in any further analysis or application of the research findings.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format for easy access and review, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its citation.
