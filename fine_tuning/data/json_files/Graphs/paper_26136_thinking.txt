To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Modeling Sentiment Dependencies with Graph Convolutional Networks for Aspect-level Sentiment Classification" by Pinlong Zhao et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors evaluate their approach on the **SemEval 2014 datasets**, which indicates that there are specific datasets used for their experiments.

Next, I will look for more details in the **experiments section**. In section 4.1, the authors mention that they conduct experiments on two datasets from **SemEval 2014 Task 4**, specifically focusing on reviews in the **laptop** and **restaurant** domains. They provide a table (Table 1) that outlines the details of these datasets, including the number of positive, negative, and neutral sentiments for both datasets.

The datasets mentioned are:

1. **SemEval 2014 Restaurant Dataset**: This dataset includes reviews with sentiment polarities categorized as positive, negative, and neutral. The table indicates the number of instances for each sentiment category.

2. **SemEval 2014 Laptop Dataset**: Similar to the restaurant dataset, this dataset also contains reviews with sentiment polarities categorized as positive, negative, and neutral, with specific counts provided in the table.

Now, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The SemEval 2014 datasets are typically cited as follows:

- For the **SemEval 2014 Task 4 datasets**, the citation is:
  > M. Pontiki, D. Galanis, J. Pavlopoulos, H. Papageorgiou, I. Androutsopoulos, S. Manandhar. *SemEval-2014 Task 4: Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis*. In Proceedings of the 8th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation, SemEval@COLING 2014, Dublin, Ireland, August 23-24, 2014, pp. 27â€“35.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
