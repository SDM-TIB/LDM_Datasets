To extract datasets from the research paper titled "von Mises Quasi-Processes for Bayesian Circular Regression" by Yarden Cohen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions experiments involving the prediction of wind directions and the percentage of the running gait cycle as a function of joint angles. This indicates that there are datasets related to these experiments.

Next, I will look into **section 6 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe two specific experiments:

1. **Wind Directions in Germany**: The authors state that they used data from the German weather service (Deutcher Wetterdienst (DWD)), which consists of measurements collected at 260 weather stations every 10 minutes during a specific stormy weather period. This dataset is crucial for understanding the model's application to predicting wind directions.

2. **Percentage of Running Gait Cycle from Joint Angles**: The authors refer to data collected by Shkedy Rabani et al. (2022) from 16 healthy adults running on a treadmill at various surface gradients. This dataset is used to predict the phase in the running gait cycle based on joint angles.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the **References section**:

- For the **German weather service (DWD)** dataset, the citation is:
  > Deutcher Wetterdienst (DWD). *https://dwd.de*.

- For the **running gait cycle dataset**, the citation is:
  > Shkedy Rabani, A., Mizrachi, S., Sawicki, G. S., and Riemer, R. (2022). *Parametric equations to study and predict lower-limb joint kinematics and kinetics during human walking and slow running on slopes*. PloS one, 17(8): e0269061.

After identifying the datasets and their citations, I will summarize the key details for each dataset, including their purpose and characteristics, ensuring that I maintain clarity and accuracy in the descriptions.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that is ready for review or further processing, ensuring that all necessary information is included and properly cited.
