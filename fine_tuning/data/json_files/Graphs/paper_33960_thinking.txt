To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Self-supervised Contrastive Learning for Implicit Collaborative Filtering" by Shipeng Song et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions validation on multiple datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed used.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Experiment Settings)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. They mention five publicly available datasets:

1. **MovieLens-100k**: This dataset contains 943 users, 1,682 items, and 100,000 interactions.
2. **MovieLens-1M**: This dataset includes 6,040 users, 3,952 items, and 1,000,000 interactions.
3. **Yahoo!-R3**: This dataset has 5,400 users, 1,000 items, and 182,000 interactions.
4. **Yelp2018**: This dataset consists of 31,668 users, 38,048 items, and 1,561,406 interactions.
5. **Gowalla**: This dataset contains 29,858 users, 40,981 items, and 1,027,370 interactions.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. However, since these datasets are well-known and widely used in the research community, they may not have specific citations in the references. Instead, I will provide general information about them:

- **MovieLens-100k**: 
  > GroupLens Research. *MovieLens 100K Dataset*. Available at: https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/100k/

- **MovieLens-1M**: 
  > GroupLens Research. *MovieLens 1M Dataset*. Available at: https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/1m/

- **Yahoo!-R3**: 
  > Yahoo! Labs. *Yahoo! R3 Dataset*. Available at: https://webscope.sandbox.yahoo.com/catalog.php?datatype=r

- **Yelp2018**: 
  > Yelp. *Yelp Dataset Challenge 2018*. Available at: https://www.yelp.com/dataset/challenge

- **Gowalla**: 
  > Gowalla. *Gowalla Dataset*. Available at: https://snap.stanford.edu/data/loc-gowalla.html

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets with their respective details and citations, ensuring that I maintain clarity and accuracy in the documentation process. This will allow for a comprehensive understanding of the datasets utilized in the research.
