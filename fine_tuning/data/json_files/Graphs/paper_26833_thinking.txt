To extract datasets from the research paper titled "div2vec: Diversity-Emphasized Node Embedding" by Jisu Jeong et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on the **MovieLens dataset** and two real-world services, WATCHA and LINE Wallet Coupon. This suggests that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors provide specific details about the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention:

1. **MovieLens Dataset**: The authors specify that they used the **MovieLens-25M** dataset for offline testing. They describe the dataset's characteristics, including the number of records, users, and movies, as well as the preprocessing steps taken to convert ratings into binary data.

2. **Tag Genome**: They also mention using the **Tag Genome** from MovieLens-25M to compute intra-list similarity, which is relevant for their evaluation metrics.

In the **experiments section**, they confirm that these datasets were utilized for their offline tests, reinforcing their importance in the study.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **MovieLens Dataset**, the citation is:
  > F. Maxwell Harper and Joseph A. Konstan. *The MovieLens Datasets: History and Context*. ACM Trans. Interact. Intell. Syst. 5, 4, Article 19 (Dec. 2015), 19 pages. https://doi.org/10.1145/2827872

- For the **Tag Genome**, the citation is:
  > Jesse Vig, Shilad Sen, and John Riedl. *The Tag Genome: Encoding Community Knowledge to Support Novel Interaction*. ACM Trans. Interact. Intell. Syst. 2, 3, Article 13 (Sept. 2012), 44 pages. https://doi.org/10.1145/2362394.2362395

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described accurately and includes the full citation as required. This will prepare the information for structured output or further analysis.
