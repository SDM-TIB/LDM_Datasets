To extract datasets from the research paper titled "HOP: History-and-Order Aware Pre-training for Vision-and-Language Navigation" by Yanyuan Qiao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of the proposed method on four downstream VLN tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **Datasets** section or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors mention using four downstream tasks: R2R, RxR, NDH, and REVERIE. I will need to find out what datasets these tasks are based on.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide details about the datasets used for pre-training and evaluation. They mention two main datasets:

1. **R2R Dataset**: This dataset is collected from the Matterport3D simulator and contains 21,567 navigation instructions, 7,189 trajectories, and 10,800 panoramic views of real-world indoor environments. The average length of each instruction is 29 words.

2. **BnB Dataset**: This dataset collects image-caption pairs from Airbnb. The authors mention that they processed this dataset to adapt it for their pre-training tasks, resulting in 342K image sequence-caption pairs.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For the **R2R Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Peter Anderson, Qi Wu, Damien Teney, Jake Bruce, Mark Johnson, Niko Sünderhauf, Ian D. Reid, Stephen Gould, and Anton van den Hengel. *Vision-and-language navigation: Interpreting visually-grounded navigation instructions in real environments*. In CVPR, pages 3674–3683, 2018.

- For the **BnB Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Dong An, Yuankai Qi, Yan Huang, Qi Wu, Liang Wang, and Tieniu Tan. *Neighbor-view enhanced model for vision and language navigation*. In ACM MM, 2021.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details and that the citations are accurate and complete.
