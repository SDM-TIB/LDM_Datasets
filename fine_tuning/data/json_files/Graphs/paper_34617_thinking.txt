To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Self-Supervised Skeleton-Based Action Representation Learning: A Benchmark and Beyond" by Jiahang Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that extensive experiments were conducted under three large-scale datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Benchmark Skeleton SSL Methods)**, where the authors summarize popular datasets for skeleton action understanding. This section is likely to contain the most relevant information regarding the datasets used in their experiments.

In **Table 1**, the authors list several datasets along with their characteristics. The datasets mentioned include:

1. **CMU Dataset**: This dataset is noted for its comprehensive motion capture data.
   - Citation: > CMU. Cmu graphics lab motion capture database. [Online] http://mocap.cs.cmu.edu, 2003.

2. **NTU RGB+D 60 Dataset**: A widely used dataset with 56,578 videos and 60 action categories.
   - Citation: > Amir Shahroudy, Jun Liu, Tian-Tsong Ng, and Gang Wang. *NTU RGB-D: A large scale dataset for 3D human activity analysis*. In Proceedings of the IEEE CVPR, 2016.

3. **NTU RGB+D 120 Dataset**: An extension of the NTU 60 dataset with 114,480 videos and 120 action categories.
   - Citation: > Jun Liu, Amir Shahroudy, Mauricio Perez, Gang Wang, Ling-Yu Duan, and Alex C Kot. *NTU-RGB D 120: A large-scale benchmark for 3D human activity understanding*. IEEE TPAMI, 42(10):2684–2701, 2019.

4. **PKU Multi-Modality Dataset (PKUMMD)**: A large-scale benchmark with two subsets for action detection.
   - Citation: > Jiaying Liu, Sijie Song, Chunhui Liu, Yanghao Li, and Yueyu Hu. *A benchmark dataset and comparison study for multi-modal human action analytics*. ACM TOMM, 16(2):41:1–41:24, 2020.

5. **Kinetics Dataset**: A large dataset with approximately 260,000 video clips for action recognition.
   - Citation: > Will Kay, Joao Carreira, Karen Simonyan, Brian Zhang, Chloe Hillier, Sudheendra Vijayanarasimhan, Fabio Viola, Tim Green, Trevor Back, Paul Natsev, et al. *The kinetics human action video dataset*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1705.06950, 2017.

6. **BABEL Dataset**: A dataset collected using marker-based methods.
   - Citation: > Abhinanda R Punnakkal, Arjun Chandrasekaran, Nikos Athanasiou, Alejandra Quiros-Ramirez, and Michael J Black. *Babel: Bodies, action and behavior with english labels*. In Proceedings of the IEEE CVPR, 2021.

After identifying these datasets, I will ensure to note their characteristics, such as the number of instances, action classes, and any specific features mentioned in the paper.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information along with their full citations into a structured format for easy reference. This will ensure that I have accurately captured all relevant datasets and their citations from the research paper.
