To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A MULTI-RESOLUTION LOW-RANK TENSOR DECOMPOSITION" by Sergio Rozada and Antonio G. Marques, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research but does not mention specific datasets. Therefore, I will focus on the **introduction** and **experiments** sections for more detailed information.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the relevance of tensor decomposition in various fields but do not specify any datasets. I will then move to **section 5 (Numerical Experiments)**, where the authors describe three different scenarios for testing their proposed method. Here, they mention specific datasets:

1. **Amino Acids Dataset**: This dataset is described as a three-mode tensor of size 5 × 201 × 61. The authors reference this dataset in the context of their experiments.

2. **Video Signal Dataset**: This dataset consists of 173 frames of 1080 × 720 pixels each, resulting in a four-mode tensor of size 9 × 36 × 54 × 3 after subsampling and lowering the resolution.

3. **Multivariate Function Dataset**: The authors describe a tensor created from a continuous function, which is sampled to create a tensor with 106 entries. This dataset is used to demonstrate the effectiveness of their method in approximating multivariate functions.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The authors reference the amino acids dataset and the video signal dataset, but they do not provide specific citations for these datasets in the references. However, they do reference the Tensorly Python package, which may provide additional context or links to datasets used in their experiments.

For the **Amino Acids Dataset**, I will cite the original source:
- Bro, R. (1998). *Multi-way analysis in the food industry-models, algorithms, and applications*. Ph.D. dissertation, University of Amsterdam (NL).

For the **Video Signal Dataset**, since it is a common dataset used in video processing, I will note that it is often referenced in the context of video analysis but does not have a specific citation provided in this paper.

For the **Multivariate Function Dataset**, there is no specific citation provided, as it is a synthetic dataset created for the purpose of this research.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the relevant citations where applicable. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
