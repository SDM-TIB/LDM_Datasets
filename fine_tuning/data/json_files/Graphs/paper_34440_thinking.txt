To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fine-tuning the SwissBERT Encoder Model for Embedding Sentences and Documents" by Juri Grosjean and Jannis Vamvas, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors fine-tuned the SwissBERT model using a large number of news articles, which suggests that there is a dataset involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Fine-tuning)**, where the authors describe the fine-tuning process. They mention that the fine-tuning data consists of over **1.5 million Swiss news articles** obtained from the **Swissdox@LiRI database**. This is a significant dataset, and I will need to note its details.

In **section 4.1 (Dataset)**, the authors provide specific information about the evaluation dataset used, which is the **20 Minuten dataset**. They describe it as based on articles from one of the most widely circulated German-language newspapers in Switzerland, which is crucial for understanding the context of the dataset.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **Swissdox@LiRI database**, while the paper does not provide a specific citation, it is important to note that it is a resource for Swiss news articles. I will mention it as a dataset source but may not have a formal citation.

2. For the **20 Minuten dataset**, the citation is:
   > Tannon Kew, Marek Kostrzewa, and Sarah Ebling. *20 Minuten: A multi-task news summarisation dataset for German*. In Proceedings of the 8th edition of the Swiss Text Analytics Conference, pages 1–13, Neuchatel, Switzerland. Association for Computational Linguistics, 2023.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

- **Dataset 1**: Swissdox@LiRI database
  - Description: A collection of over 1.5 million Swiss news articles in German, French, Italian, and Romansh.
  - Citation: Not formally cited in the paper.

- **Dataset 2**: 20 Minuten dataset
  - Description: A dataset based on articles from the 20 Minuten newspaper, used for evaluating the SentenceSwissBERT model.
  - Citation: Tannon Kew, Marek Kostrzewa, and Sarah Ebling. *20 Minuten: A multi-task news summarisation dataset for German*. In Proceedings of the 8th edition of the Swiss Text Analytics Conference, pages 1–13, Neuchatel, Switzerland. Association for Computational Linguistics, 2023.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
