To extract datasets from the research paper titled "GCL: Gradient-Guided Contrastive Learning for Medical Image Segmentation with Multi-Perspective Meta Labels" by Yixuan Wu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on "four medical image segmentation datasets," which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention the following datasets:

1. **ACDC (Automated Cardiac Diagnosis Challenge)**: This dataset is used for cardiac segmentation tasks and includes various meta labels such as Patient_ID, Slice_quantile, and Organ_state.

2. **Prostate Dataset**: This dataset is utilized for prostate segmentation and also includes meta labels like Patient_ID and Slice_quantile.

3. **MMWHS (Multi-Modality Whole Heart Segmentation)**: This dataset is mentioned for segmentation tasks, and it shares similar meta labels as the Prostate dataset.

4. **HVSMR (Heart Ventricles Segmentation Challenge)**: This dataset is used for segmentation tasks and is part of the evaluation for the proposed method.

In the **References section**, I will look for full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. 

The citations I find are:

- For **ACDC**:
  > Bernard, O., Lalande, A., Zotti, C., et al. (2018). Deep learning techniques for automatic MRI cardiac multi-structures segmentation and diagnosis: Is the problem solved? *IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging*, 37(1), 1-12.

- For **Prostate Dataset**:
  > Antonelli, M., Reinke, A., Bakas, S., et al. (2022). The medical segmentation decathlon. *Nature Communications*, 13(1), 1-11.

- For **MMWHS**:
  > Zhuang, X., & Shen, J. (2016). Multi-scale patch and multi-modality atlases for whole heart segmentation of MRI. *Medical Image Analysis*, 30, 1-12.

- For **HVSMR**:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details and that the citations are accurate and complete.
