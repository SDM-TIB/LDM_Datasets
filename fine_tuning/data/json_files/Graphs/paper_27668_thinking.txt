To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Quality Assurance Challenges for Machine Learning Software Applications During Software Development Life Cycle Phases" by Md Abdullah Al Alamin and Gias Uddin, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and background sections** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract discusses quality assurance challenges in machine learning software applications but does not explicitly mention any datasets. The introduction provides context about the importance of quality assurance in machine learning but again does not specify any datasets.

Next, I will examine the **related work section** to see if any datasets are referenced in the context of previous studies. This section cites various papers but does not provide specific dataset names.

I will then look into the **taxonomy of quality assurance challenges** presented in the paper. While this section outlines challenges faced during different phases of the software development life cycle (SDLC), it does not mention specific datasets used in the research.

Since the paper does not explicitly mention any datasets used for experiments or analysis, I will check the **references section** for any papers that might have associated datasets. However, the references primarily cite other research papers and do not provide direct links to datasets.

After reviewing the entire paper, it appears that there are no specific datasets mentioned or utilized in the research. The focus is more on the challenges and recommendations regarding quality assurance in machine learning software applications rather than on empirical studies involving specific datasets.

In conclusion, since no datasets are explicitly mentioned in the paper, I will not be able to provide any dataset citations. Instead, I will summarize the findings related to quality assurance challenges without dataset entries.
