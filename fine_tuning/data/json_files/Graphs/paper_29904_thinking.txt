To extract datasets from the research paper titled "From Spectral Graph Convolutions to Large Scale Graph Convolutional Networks" by Matteo Bunino, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to look for any explicit mentions of datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the work, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, I will look for phrases that indicate the use of specific datasets, such as "we evaluate our method on the Cora dataset." This will help me identify the datasets that are central to the experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**. This section typically contains detailed information about the datasets used for evaluation. I will look for subsections that specifically mention datasets, such as "Datasets" or "Experimental Setup." Here, I will find the names of the datasets, their characteristics, and how they were used in the experiments.

In this paper, the authors mention using the **Cora dataset** for their experiments. I will note down the details provided about this dataset, including its size, the type of data it contains, and any specific splits used for training and testing.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets themselves.

For the **Cora dataset**, I will find the citation, which is typically included in the references. The citation for the Cora dataset is:
> Thomas N. Kipf and Max Welling. *Semi-Supervised Classification with Graph Convolutional Networks*. In 5th International Conference on Learning Representations, ICLR 2017, Toulon, France, April 24-26, 2017, Conference Track Proceedings, OpenReview.net, 2017.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation for each dataset identified in the paper. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.
