To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Dynamic Spatiotemporal Graph Neural Network with Tensor Network" by Chengcheng Jia et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors compare their method with state-of-the-art GNN methods on public traffic datasets, indicating that datasets are involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges in time series prediction and the need for dynamic graphs, but they do not specify any datasets yet. I will continue to the **methodology** section, where they describe the construction of the Spatial Tensor Graph (STG) and Temporal Tensor Graph (TTG), but again, no specific datasets are mentioned.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**. Here, the authors explicitly mention the **METR-LA dataset**, which contains traffic speed statistics over sensor stations in California. They provide details about the dataset, including the time range and the number of stations used for their experiments.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the METR-LA dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:
> Chao Chen, Karl Petty, Alexander Skabardonis, Pravin Varaiya, and Zhanfeng Jia. *Freeway performance measurement system: mining loop detector data*. Transportation Research Record, 1748(1):96â€“102, 2001.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the information:

1. **METR-LA Dataset**: This dataset contains four months of traffic speed statistics over 39,000 sensor stations in California, aggregated into 5-minute intervals from 30-second data samples. The authors specifically use data from District 7, which includes 256 stations, for their experiments.

With this information, I will prepare to create structured entries for the dataset, ensuring that the full citation is included as required. This will allow for clear documentation and reference in any subsequent analysis or reporting.
