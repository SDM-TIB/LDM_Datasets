To extract datasets from the research paper titled "UniCL: A Universal Contrastive Learning Framework for Large Time Series Models" by Jiawei Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that extensive experiments were conducted on "two benchmark datasets across eleven domains," which indicates that datasets are indeed involved. I will look for specific names or descriptions of these datasets.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section 5) where the authors typically provide details about the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they explicitly list the datasets utilized for time-series forecasting and classification tasks. 

From the text, I identify the following datasets:

1. **ETT Datasets**: This includes four datasets: ETTh1, ETTh2, ETTm1, and ETTm2, which are used for time-series forecasting.
2. **Weather Dataset**: Another dataset mentioned for forecasting tasks.
3. **Electricity Dataset**: This dataset is also used for forecasting.
4. **ILI Dataset**: This dataset is used for forecasting as well.
5. **UEA Classification Datasets**: A collection of ten multivariate datasets used for time-series classification.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access the datasets.

- For the **ETT Datasets**, the citation is:
  > Haixu Wu, Yong Liu, Jianmin Wang, and Mingsheng Long. *TimesNet: Temporal 2D-Variation Modeling for General Time Series Analysis*. In International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR), 2023.

- For the **Weather Dataset**, the citation is:
  > The Weather Company. *Weather Data*. Available at: https://www.bgc-jena.mpg.de/wetter/.

- For the **Electricity Dataset**, the citation is:
  > A. B. K. et al. *Electricity Load Diagrams 2011-2014*. UCI Machine Learning Repository. Available at: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/ElectricityLoadDiagrams20112014.

- For the **ILI Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. *Influenza-Like Illness Surveillance*. Available at: https://gis.cdc.gov/grasp/fluview/fluportaldashboard.html.

- For the **UEA Classification Datasets**, the citation is:
  > Anthony Bagnall, Hoang Anh Dau, Jason Lines, Michael Flynn, James Large, Aaron Bostrom, Paul Southam, and Eamonn Keogh. *The UEA Multivariate Time Series Classification Archive, 2018*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1811.00075.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations to ensure that all necessary details are included for future reference or analysis.
