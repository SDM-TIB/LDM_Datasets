To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DEHRFORMER: REAL-TIME TRANSFORMER FOR DEPTH ESTIMATION AND HAZE REMOVAL FROM VARICOLORED HAZE SCENES" by Sixiang Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors propose a new model for depth estimation and haze removal, which suggests that they may have used specific datasets for their experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used. In this section, they introduce the **varicolored haze removal and depth estimation (VHRDE) dataset**, which consists of 8000 paired data for haze removal and depth estimation tasks. They specify that 6,000 paired haze images from this dataset were used for training and 2,000 for testing.

Additionally, the authors mention using **2,000 real hazy images from the URHI (Unannotated Real Hazy Images) dataset** for semi-supervised training and 1,000 real hazy samples for testing.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **VHRDE dataset**, since it is a new dataset introduced in this paper, I will cite it as follows:
   > Chen, S., Ye, T., Shi, J., Liu, Y., Jiang, J.X., Chen, E., & Chen, P. (2023). Varicolored haze removal and depth estimation (VHRDE) dataset. *DEHRFORMER: REAL-TIME TRANSFORMER FOR DEPTH ESTIMATION AND HAZE REMOVAL FROM VARICOLORED HAZE SCENES*.

2. For the **URHI dataset**, the citation is:
   > Li, B., Ren, W., Fu, D., Tao, D., Feng, D., Zeng, W., & Wang, Z. (2018). Benchmarking single-image dehazing and beyond. *IEEE Transactions on Image Processing*, 28(1), 492-505.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented and properly cited.
