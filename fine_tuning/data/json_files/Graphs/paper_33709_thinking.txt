To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-Patch Prediction: Adapting LLMs for Time Series Representation Learning" by Yuxuan Bian et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. In the abstract, the authors discuss their framework's evaluation on various time-series datasets, which indicates that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 5) where the authors provide detailed information about the datasets used for their experiments. Specifically, I will look for subsections that list the datasets used for long-term forecasting, short-term forecasting, and anomaly detection.

In **Section 5.1 (Experimental Settings)**, the authors mention that they evaluate their proposed method on **eight popular datasets** for long-term forecasting, including:

1. **Weather Dataset**: Contains 21 meteorological indicators in Germany.
2. **Traffic Dataset**: Records road occupancy rates from various sensors on San Francisco freeways.
3. **Electricity Dataset**: Comprises hourly electricity consumption data for 321 customers.
4. **ILI Dataset**: Captures the count of patients and the influenza-like illness ratio weekly.
5. **ETTh1 Dataset**: A dataset sourced from an electricity transformer with a specific resolution.
6. **ETTh2 Dataset**: Another dataset from a different electricity transformer.
7. **ETTm1 Dataset**: A dataset with a different resolution from the electricity transformer.
8. **ETTm2 Dataset**: Another dataset with a different resolution.

For short-term forecasting, they evaluate on the **M4 Dataset**, which is widely used in marketing.

For anomaly detection, they mention five datasets:

1. **SMD Dataset**: Server machine dataset from an Internet company.
2. **MSL Dataset**: Mars Science Laboratory rover telemetry data.
3. **SMAP Dataset**: Soil Moisture Active Passive satellite telemetry data.
4. **SWaT Dataset**: Data collected from sensors in a secure water treatment system.
5. **PSM Dataset**: Pooled server metrics from various application server nodes at eBay.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and further exploration.
