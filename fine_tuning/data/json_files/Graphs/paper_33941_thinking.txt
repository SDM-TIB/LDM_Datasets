To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "LeOCLR: Leveraging Original Images for Contrastive Learning of Visual Representations" by Mohammad Alkhalefi et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments across different datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention three datasets:

1. **STL-10**: This dataset is described as "unlabeled" and contains 100,000 training images. It is commonly used for evaluating unsupervised learning methods.

2. **CIFAR-10**: This dataset consists of 50,000 training images and is a well-known benchmark for image classification tasks.

3. **ImageNet-1K**: This dataset contains 1.28 million training images and is one of the largest and most widely used datasets for image classification.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **STL-10**, the citation is:
  > Coates, A., & Ng, A.Y. (2011). Analysis of large-scale visual recognition. In Advances in neural information processing systems (pp. 284–292).

- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
  > Krizhevsky, A. (2009). Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images. Tech. rep., Citeseer.

- For **ImageNet-1K**, the citation is:
  > Russakovsky, O., Deng, J., Su, H., Krause, J., Satheesh, S., Ma, S., Huang, Z., Karpathy, A., Khosla, A., Bernstein, M., Berg, A.C., & Fei-Fei, L. (2015). ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge. International Journal of Computer Vision, 115(3), 211–252. https://doi.org/10.1007/s11263-015-0816-y

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, which is crucial for reproducibility and further research.
