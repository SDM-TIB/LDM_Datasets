To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Unsupervised Mutual Learning of Dialogue Discourse Parsing and Topic Segmentation" by Jiahui Xu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods on "two dialogue rhetorical datasets (STAC and Molweni), as well as dialogue topic datasets (Doc2Dial and TIAGE)." This indicates that there are four datasets of interest.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any relevant sections that describe the datasets in detail. In this paper, the datasets are mentioned in **section 4.1 (Experiment Settings)**, where the authors provide a table listing the datasets used for their experiments. The table includes the names of the datasets and their respective tasks.

The datasets identified are:

1. **STAC**: Used for discourse parsing.
2. **Molweni**: Also used for discourse parsing.
3. **Doc2Dial**: Used for topic segmentation.
4. **TIAGE**: Used for topic segmentation.

Now, I will gather full citations for each dataset from the **References section** of the paper. The citations are as follows:

- For **STAC**, the citation is:
  > Nicholas Asher, Julie Hunter, Mathieu Morey, Farah Benamara, and Stergos Afantenos. *Discourse structure and dialogue acts in multiparty dialogue: the stac corpus*. In 10th International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC 2016), pages 2721–2727, 2016.

- For **Molweni**, the citation is:
  > Jiaqi Li, Ming Liu, Min-Yen Kan, Zihao Zheng, Zekun Wang, Wenqiang Lei, Ting Liu, and Bing Qin. *Molweni: A challenge multiparty dialogues-based machine reading comprehension dataset with discourse structure*. In Proceedings of the 28th International Conference on Computational Linguistics, pages 2642–2652, 2020.

- For **Doc2Dial**, the citation is:
  > Song Feng, Hui Wan, Chulaka Gunasekara, Siva Patel, Sachindra Joshi, and Luis Lastras. *doc2dial: A goal-oriented document-grounded dialogue dataset*. In Proceedings of the 2020 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), pages 8118–8128, 2020.

- For **TIAGE**, the citation is:
  > Huiyuan Xie, Zhenghao Liu, Chenyan Xiong, Zhiyuan Liu, and Ann Copestake. *Tiage: A benchmark for topic-shift aware dialog modeling*. In Findings of the Association for Computational Linguistics: EMNLP 2021, pages 1684–1690, 2021.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described along with its full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I have comprehensively extracted and documented the datasets used in the research paper.
