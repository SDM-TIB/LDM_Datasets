To extract datasets from the research paper titled "UDC: A Unified Neural Divide-and-Conquer Framework for Large-Scale Combinatorial Optimization Problems" by Zhi Zheng et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for evaluation. 

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics. 

In this paper, the authors mention evaluating their method on various combinatorial optimization problems, and they refer to benchmark datasets such as **TSPLib** and **CVRPLib**. I will note these datasets and any specific instances or configurations mentioned in the text.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access the datasets. 

For example, the citations for the datasets might look like this:

- **TSPLib**: Reinelt, G. (1991). TSPLIB - A Traveling Salesman Problem Library. ORSA Journal on Computing, 3(4), 376-384.
- **CVRPLib**: Uchoa, E., Pecin, D., Pessoa, A., Poggi, M., Vidal, T., & Subramanian, A. (2017). New benchmark instances for the capacitated vehicle routing problem. European Journal of Operational Research, 257(3), 845-858.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, into a structured format for easy reference. This will ensure that all relevant details are captured and presented clearly.
