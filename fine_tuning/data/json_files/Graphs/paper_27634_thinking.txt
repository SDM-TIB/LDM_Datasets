To extract datasets from the research paper titled "User Preference-aware Fake News Detection" by Yingtong Dou et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the effectiveness of the proposed framework on real-world datasets, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors mention the need for novel approaches in fake news detection and reference existing datasets. This section may provide insights into the datasets used for their experiments.

In the **experiments section**, specifically **section 3.1.1 (Dataset)**, the authors clearly state that they utilize the **FakeNewsNet dataset**. They describe it as containing fake and real news information from two fact-checking websites along with related social engagement from Twitter. This is a crucial dataset for their study.

Additionally, the authors mention two other datasets in **Table 1**: **Politifact (POL)** and **Gossipcop (GOS)**. The table provides statistics about these datasets, including the number of graphs, total nodes, and total edges, which indicates their significance in the experiments.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to retrieve the full citations for these datasets:

1. **FakeNewsNet dataset**:
   > Kai Shu, Deepak Mahudeswaran, Suhang Wang, Dongwon Lee, and Huan Liu. 2020. *Fakenewsnet: A data repository with news content, social context, and spatiotemporal information for studying fake news on social media*. Big Data 8, 3 (2020), 171â€“188.

2. **Politifact dataset**:
   > William Yang Wang. 2017. *"Liar, Liar Pants on Fire": A New Benchmark Dataset for Fake News Detection*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1705.00648 (2017).

3. **Gossipcop dataset**:
   > Natali Ruchansky, Sungyong Seo, and Yan Liu. 2017. *CSI: A hybrid deep model for fake news detection*. In CIKM.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

- **FakeNewsNet**: A comprehensive dataset containing fake and real news articles along with social engagement data from Twitter.
- **Politifact**: A dataset that serves as a benchmark for fake news detection, providing labeled news articles.
- **Gossipcop**: A dataset that includes news articles and their corresponding fact-checking information.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
