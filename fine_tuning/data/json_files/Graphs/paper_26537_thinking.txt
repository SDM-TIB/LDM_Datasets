To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Contextualised Graph Attention for Improved Relation Extraction" by Angrosh Mandya et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance on the **SemEval 2010 Task 8 dataset**, which indicates that this dataset is crucial for the experiments conducted in the paper.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (section 4) to gather more details about the dataset. In section 4.1, the authors provide a description of the **SemEval 2010 Task 8 dataset**, stating that it contains **10,717 sentences** with specific annotations for relation extraction tasks. This section confirms the dataset's significance and provides context for its use in the experiments.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the SemEval 2010 Task 8 dataset. The citation is typically included in the references, and I will ensure to extract it accurately.

The full citation for the SemEval 2010 Task 8 dataset is:
> Rink, B., & Harabagiu, S. (2010). UTD: Classifying semantic relations by combining lexical and semantic resources. In Proceedings of the 5th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (pp. 256–259). Association for Computational Linguistics.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the findings:

1. **Dataset Name**: SemEval 2010 Task 8 dataset
   - **Description**: Contains 10,717 sentences (8,000 train and 2,717 test), each marked with two nominals and labelled with a relation from a set of 9 different relation types and an artificial relation "Other".
   - **Citation**: Rink, B., & Harabagiu, S. (2010). UTD: Classifying semantic relations by combining lexical and semantic resources. In Proceedings of the 5th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (pp. 256–259). Association for Computational Linguistics.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that the dataset details and citations are clearly presented.
