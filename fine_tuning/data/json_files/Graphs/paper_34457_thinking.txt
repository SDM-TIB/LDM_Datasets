To extract datasets from the research paper titled "HecVL: Hierarchical Video-Language Pretraining for Zero-shot Surgical Phase Recognition" by Kun Yuan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors constructed a hierarchical video-text paired dataset, which suggests that there is a dataset central to their research.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experiment setup)**, where the authors discuss the datasets used for pretraining and evaluation. Here, they mention the **Surgical Video Lecture dataset (SVL)**, which is the primary dataset they used for pretraining. They also mention that they expanded this dataset by incorporating additional phase- and video-level video-text pairs using metadata from each lecture video.

In addition, the authors specify that they evaluated their model on three public datasets: **Cholec80**, **AutoLaparo**, and **StrasBypass70/BernBypass70**. These datasets are crucial for understanding the performance of their model in a zero-shot setting.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

1. **Surgical Video Lecture dataset (SVL)**: The citation for this dataset is:
   > Yuan, K., Srivastav, V., Yu, T., Lavanchy, J., Mascagni, P., Navab, N., Padoy, N. *Learning multi-modal representations by watching hundreds of surgical video lectures*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2307.15220, 2023.

2. **Cholec80**: The citation for this dataset is:
   > Twinanda, A.P., Shehata, S., Mutter, D., Marescaux, J., De Mathelin, M., Padoy, N. *Endonet: a deep architecture for recognition tasks on laparoscopic videos*. IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging, 36(1), 86-97, 2016.

3. **AutoLaparo**: The citation for this dataset is:
   > Wang, Z., Lu, B., Long, Y., Zhong, F., Cheung, T.H., Dou, Q., Liu, Y. *Autolaparo: A new dataset of integrated multi-tasks for image-guided surgical automation in laparoscopic hysterectomy*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer-Assisted Intervention, 486-496, 2022.

4. **StrasBypass70** and **BernBypass70**: The citation for these datasets is:
   > Lavanchy, J.L., Ramesh, S., Dallâ€™Alba, D., Gonzalez, C., Fiorini, P., Muller-Stich, B., Nett, P.C., Marescaux, J., Mutter, D., Padoy, N. *Challenges in multi-centric generalization: Phase and step recognition in roux-en-y gastric bypass surgery*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2312.11250, 2023.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations to ensure that all details are accurately represented. This structured approach will help in creating a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research.
