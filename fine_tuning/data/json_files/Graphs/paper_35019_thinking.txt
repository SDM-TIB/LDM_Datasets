To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Topology Reorganized Graph Contrastive Learning with Mitigating Semantic Drift" by Jiaqiang Zhang and Songcan Chen, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention conducting extensive experiments on five real-world datasets. This indicates that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors provide a summary of the datasets in **section 5.1 (Datasets)**, where they describe five benchmark datasets used for their experiments:

1. **CiteSeer**: A citation network where nodes represent publications and edges represent citations.
2. **WikiCS**: A computer-science related network built on Wikipedia, where nodes are articles and edges are hyperlinks.
3. **Coauthor-CS**: A citation network where nodes represent authors and edges represent co-authorship relationships.
4. **Amazon-Computers**: A co-purchasing relationship network where nodes are products and edges represent co-purchases.
5. **Amazon-Photo**: Similar to Amazon-Computers, but focused on photo-related products.

Each dataset is described in terms of its structure and the relationships it represents, which is crucial for understanding their application in the research.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. However, since these datasets are commonly used benchmark datasets in the field, they may not have specific citations in the references. Instead, I will provide general descriptions based on their common usage:

- **CiteSeer**: Often referenced in literature as a benchmark dataset for citation networks.
- **WikiCS**: Commonly cited in studies involving Wikipedia-based networks.
- **Coauthor-CS**: Frequently used in research on co-authorship networks.
- **Amazon-Computers**: A well-known dataset in the domain of recommendation systems.
- **Amazon-Photo**: Similar to Amazon-Computers, also widely used in recommendation system research.

Since specific citations may not be available in the references, I will note that these datasets are widely recognized in the academic community.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the names and descriptions of each dataset, along with any relevant citations or notes about their common usage in the field. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture the datasets used in the research paper.
