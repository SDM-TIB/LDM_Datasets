To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Self-supervised Monocular Depth Estimation for All Day Images using Domain Separation" by Lina Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results on the **Oxford RobotCar dataset**, indicating that this dataset is crucial for the experiments conducted in the paper.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (section 4) to gather more details about the datasets used. In section 4.1, the authors explicitly state that they utilize the **Oxford RobotCar dataset** for their experiments. They describe it as a large outdoor-driving dataset that contains images captured at various times throughout the year, including both day and night images. This section provides essential details about how the dataset is split for training and testing.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the **Oxford RobotCar dataset**. The citation provided in the references is:
> Will Maddern, Geoffrey Pascoe, Chris Linegar, and Paul Newman. *1 year, 1000 km: The Oxford RobotCar Dataset*. The International Journal of Robotics Research, 36(1):3â€“15, 2017.

Since the paper primarily focuses on the **Oxford RobotCar dataset**, I will ensure that I accurately document this dataset's details and citation.

Now, I will summarize the findings:

1. **Oxford RobotCar Dataset**: This dataset is used for evaluating the proposed method. It includes images captured at various times of the day and night, making it suitable for the study of all-day depth estimation.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry with the necessary details and citation, ensuring that it is ready for any structured output or further processing.
