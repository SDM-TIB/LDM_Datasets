To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Differentiable Scaffolding Tree for Molecular Optimization" by Tianfan Fu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of a dataset called **ZINC 250K**, which is a strong indicator that this dataset is significant for the research.

Next, I will look for specific sections that detail the datasets used. In this case, the **experimental setup section (4.1)** explicitly describes the **ZINC 250K dataset**. It states that this dataset contains around 250,000 drug-like molecules and that the authors selected substructures appearing more than 1000 times in this dataset as the vocabulary set.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the ZINC 250K dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:

- **ZINC 250K Dataset**:
  > Teague Sterling and John J Irwin. *Zinc 15–ligand discovery for everyone*. Journal of chemical information and modeling, 55(11):2324–2337, 2015.

After confirming the dataset's details and citation, I will summarize the findings:

1. **ZINC 250K Dataset**: This dataset contains approximately 250,000 drug-like molecules, which were used to derive a vocabulary set of substructures for the research.

Now, I will compile this information into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and citation. This ensures that all relevant details are captured for future reference or processing.
