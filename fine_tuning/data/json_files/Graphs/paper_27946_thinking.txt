To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Sequential Recommendation with Graph Neural Networks" by Jianxin Chang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on both public and proprietary industrial datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed involved. I will look for specific names or descriptions of these datasets.

Next, I will move to the **experiments section** (Section 4) where the authors provide details about the datasets used. In **Section 4.1.1**, they explicitly mention two datasets:

1. **Taobao Dataset**: This dataset is described as being collected from the largest e-commerce platform in China, containing click data from a specific date range. The authors mention filtering out users with less than 10 interactions and provide details about the training, validation, and test splits.

2. **Kuaishou Dataset**: This dataset is collected from a popular short-video platform in China, detailing user behaviors such as clicks, likes, and follows. The authors also specify the time frame for the data collection and the filtering criteria for users and videos.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For the **Taobao Dataset**, the citation is:
> Qi Pi, Weijie Bian, Guorui Zhou, Xiaoqiang Zhu, and Kun Gai. *Practice on long sequential user behavior modeling for click-through rate prediction*. In Proceedings of the 25th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery & Data Mining (KDD), pages 2671–2679, 2019. 

For the **Kuaishou Dataset**, the citation is:
> Guorui Zhou, Xiaoqiang Zhu, Chenru Song, Ying Fan, Han Zhu, Xiao Ma, Yanghui Yan, Junqi Jin, Han Li, and Kun Gai. *Deep interest network for click-through rate prediction*. In Proceedings of the 24th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery & Data Mining (KDD), pages 1059–1068, 2018.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets, ensuring to include their names, descriptions, and full citations. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details and that the citations are accurate and complete.
