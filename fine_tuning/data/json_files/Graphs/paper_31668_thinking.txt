To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Inferring High-level Geographical Concepts via Knowledge Graph and Multi-scale Data Integration: A Case Study of C-shaped Building Pattern Recognition" by Zhiwei Wei et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors used multi-scale data collected from the Gaode Map, which suggests that this is a dataset of interest.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. In section 5.1.1, the authors describe the experimental data, stating that it comprises **85,820 buildings located in Nanjing, China**, collected from the Gaode Map. They also mention a subset of **1,977 buildings** that were manually generalized into two coarser levels, which is another dataset of interest.

I will also check the **references section** for any citations related to the datasets mentioned. The Gaode Map is a well-known mapping service in China, but I need to confirm if there are specific publications or reports that provide a formal citation for the dataset.

The relevant citations for the datasets are as follows:

1. **Gaode Map**: The dataset is referenced as:
   > Gaode Map. (n.d.). Retrieved from https://www.gaode.com/

2. **Generalized Building Dataset**: The authors do not provide a specific citation for the generalized dataset, but they mention that it was derived from the original dataset of buildings from the Gaode Map.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. The datasets extracted are:

- **Dataset 1**: 85,820 buildings from the Gaode Map.
- **Dataset 2**: Subset of 1,977 buildings generalized into coarser levels.

I will ensure that the citations are formatted correctly and are complete for each dataset. After this, I will prepare the structured output for review or further processing.
