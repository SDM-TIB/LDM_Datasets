To extract datasets from the research paper titled "All Information is Necessary: Integrating Speech Positive and Negative Information by Contrastive Learning for Speech Enhancement" by Xinmeng Xu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study but does not explicitly mention datasets. Therefore, I will focus on the **introduction** and **experiments** sections for more detailed information.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of monaural speech enhancement and the importance of utilizing both positive and negative information. However, they do not specify any datasets here.

Next, I will examine **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. They describe two datasets:

1. **VoiceBank + DEMAND**: This dataset is created by mixing clean speech from the Voice Bank with noise from the DEMAND dataset at various signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) levels. The authors provide details about the composition of the dataset, including the number of speakers and utterances.

2. **AVSpeech + AudioSet**: This dataset consists of clean speech segments collected from YouTube (AVSpeech) mixed with noise from the AudioSet dataset. The authors mention the number of segments used for training and validation.

Now, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **VoiceBank**, the citation is:
  > Valentini-Botinhao, C., Wang, X., Takaki, S., & Yamagishi, J. (2016). Investigating RNN-based speech enhancement methods for noise-robust text-to-speech. In SSW, pages 146–152.

- For **DEMAND**, the citation is:
  > Thiemann, J., Ito, N., & Vincent, E. (2013). The diverse environments multi-channel acoustic noise database (DEMAND): A database of multichannel environmental noise recordings. In Proceedings of Meetings on Acoustics ICA2013, volume 19, page 035081.

- For **AVSpeech**, the citation is:
  > Gemmeke, J. F., Ellis, D. P. W., Freedman, D., Jansen, A., Lawrence, W., Moore, R. C., Plakal, M., & Ritter, M. (2017). AudioSet: An ontology and human-labeled dataset for audio events. In 2017 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP), pages 776–780.

- For **AudioSet**, the citation is the same as above since it is part of the AVSpeech dataset description.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries with their full citations to ensure that all necessary details are included for future reference or processing.
