To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On Size and Hardness Generalization in Unsupervised Learning for the Travelling Salesman Problem" by Yimeng Min and Carla P. Gomes, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of a Graph Neural Network (GNN) for solving the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) but does not explicitly mention datasets. However, it hints at the use of various instance sizes and distributions, which may imply the existence of datasets.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** closely, as this is where datasets are typically detailed. In the experiments, the authors mention training on datasets such as **TSP-2000, TSP-1000, TSP-400, and TSP-200**. These datasets are created by randomly distributing points on a 2D plane, which is a crucial detail for understanding their structure.

I will also look for any specific references to datasets in the **results section**. The authors provide performance metrics for their models tested on these datasets, confirming their use in the experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. However, it appears that the datasets used (TSP-2000, TSP-1000, TSP-400, and TSP-200) are not standard datasets with established citations but rather datasets generated by the authors for the purpose of their experiments. Therefore, I will note that these datasets are proprietary to this study.

To summarize the datasets extracted:

1. **TSP-2000**: A dataset created by randomly distributing points on a 2D plane, consisting of 5,000 training instances.
2. **TSP-1000**: Another dataset created similarly, used for testing the model trained on TSP-2000.
3. **TSP-400**: A smaller dataset used for training, also generated by the authors.
4. **TSP-200**: The smallest dataset used for testing, created in the same manner.

Since these datasets are not published elsewhere, I will note them as proprietary datasets from the paper.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for clarity and future reference.
