To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Label Informed Contrastive Pretraining for Node Importance Estimation on Knowledge Graphs" by Tianyu Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often highlights the datasets used for experiments.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention that their experiments utilize three real-world knowledge graphs. This indicates that datasets are present, and I need to locate their specific names and details.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically the subsection titled **"Datasets"**. Here, the authors describe the datasets used in their experiments:

1. **FB15K**: This dataset is a subset of Freebase, containing around 15,000 entities and 1,345 different predicates. The importance scores for the nodes are derived from Wikipedia pageviews.

2. **TMDB5K**: This dataset is generated from the TMDB 5000 dataset and includes approximately 5,000 movie entities, along with other entities like actors and directors. The node importance is based on the popularity scores of the movies.

3. **GA16K**: This is a geoscience academic knowledge graph containing about 16,000 entities, such as papers and authors. The citation counts of the papers serve as the node importance scores.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and should be formatted correctly.

The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- **FB15K**: 
  > Bollacker, K., Evans, C., Paritosh, P., Sturge, T., & Taylor, J. (2008). Freebase: A collaboratively created graph database for structuring human knowledge. In Proceedings of the 2008 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data (pp. 1247-1250).

- **TMDB5K**: 
  > TMDB 5000 dataset. (n.d.). Retrieved from https://www.kaggle.com/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata.

- **GA16K**:

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
