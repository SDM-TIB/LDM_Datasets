To extract datasets from the research paper titled "GRAPHSPY: Fused Program Semantic-Level Embedding via Graph Neural Networks for Dead Store Detection" by Yixin Guo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors trained their model with "tens of thousands of samples acquired from a set of real-world benchmarks," which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental setup section**, where the authors provide detailed information about the datasets used. They mention that they evaluated their approach on the SPEC CPU benchmark suite, which is a well-known dataset for performance evaluation in computing.

In **Table 1**, the authors present statistics about the benchmarks used, including the number of functions, basic blocks, and data volume for various binaries. This table provides a clear indication of the datasets involved in their experiments.

The authors also mention the use of **DynamoRIO** for collecting dynamic profiles and memory-state values, which is crucial for understanding how the datasets were generated and utilized.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The SPEC CPU benchmark suite is referenced, and I will ensure to include its citation as well as any other relevant tools or datasets mentioned in the paper.

The citation for the SPEC CPU benchmark suite is:
> SPEC. (2017). SPEC CPU Benchmarks. Retrieved from http://www.spec.org/benchmarks.html#cpu.

Additionally, the citation for the DynamoRIO tool is:
> Bruening, D. (2004). DynamoRIO: Efficient, Transparent, and Comprehensive Runtime Code Manipulation. Retrieved from https://dynamorio.org/.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and that the full citations are included for reference. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
