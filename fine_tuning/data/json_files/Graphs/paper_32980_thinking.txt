To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Using Causality-Aware Graph Neural Networks to Predict Temporal Centralities in Dynamic Graphs" by Franziska Heeg and Ingo Scholtes, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their approach on **13 temporal graphs from biological and social systems**, which suggests that specific datasets are used.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental results section**, particularly where the authors discuss the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they provide a **table (Table 1)** that summarizes the datasets, including their descriptions, characteristics, and sources. This table is crucial as it contains the necessary details about each dataset.

The datasets listed in the table are:

1. **Ant Antenna Interactions (Colony 1 - Filming 1)**: This dataset captures interactions among ants in a colony during a specific filming session.
   - Citation: Blonder, B. & Dornhaus, A. (2011). *Time-ordered networks reveal limitations to information flow in ant colonies*. PloS one, 6, e20298.

2. **Ant Antenna Interactions (Colony 1 - Filming 2)**: Similar to the first, this dataset captures a different filming session of the same colony.
   - Citation: Blonder, B. & Dornhaus, A. (2011). *Time-ordered networks reveal limitations to information flow in ant colonies*. PloS one, 6, e20298.

3. **Ant Antenna Interactions (Colony 2 - Filming 1)**: This dataset captures interactions in a second colony during a filming session.
   - Citation: Blonder, B. & Dornhaus, A. (2011). *Time-ordered networks reveal limitations to information flow in ant colonies*. PloS one, 6, e20298.

4. **Ant Antenna Interactions (Colony 2 - Filming 2)**: Another filming session for the second colony.
   - Citation: Blonder, B. & Dornhaus, A. (2011). *Time-ordered networks reveal limitations to information flow in ant colonies*. PloS one, 6, e20298.

5. **Company Emails**: This dataset consists of email exchanges within a manufacturing company.
   - Citation: Nurek, M. & Michalski, R. (2020). *Combining machine learning and social network analysis to reveal the organizational structures*. Applied Sciences, 10, 1699.

6. **EU Institution Emails (Dept 2)**: Email exchanges in a department of an EU institution.
   - Citation: Paranjape, A., Benson, A. R. & Leskovec, J. (2017). *Motifs in temporal networks*. In Proceedings of the tenth ACM international conference on web search and data mining, 601–610.

7. **EU Institution Emails (Dept 3)**: Similar to the previous dataset but from a different department.
   - Citation: Paranjape, A., Benson, A. R. & Leskovec, J. (2017). *Motifs in temporal networks*. In Proceedings of the tenth ACM international conference on web search and data mining, 601–610.

8. **EU Institution Emails (Dept 4)**: Another department's email exchanges.
   - Citation: Paranjape, A., Benson, A. R. & Leskovec, J. (2017). *Motifs in temporal networks*. In Proceedings of the tenth ACM international conference on web search and data mining, 601–610.

9. **Face-to-Face Interactions in a Hospital**: This dataset captures interactions among individuals in a hospital setting.
   - Citation: Vanhems, P. et al. (2013). *Estimating potential infection transmission routes in hospital wards using wearable proximity sensors*. PloS one, 8, e73970.

10. **Face-to-Face Interactions at a Conference**: Interactions recorded during a conference.
    - Citation: Isella, L. et al. (2011). *What’s in a crowd? analysis of face-to-face behavioral networks*. Journal of theoretical biology, 271, 166–180.

11. **Face-to-Face Interactions in a Workspace**: Interactions in a workplace environment.
    - Citation: Génois, M. & Barrat, A. (2018). *Can co-location be used as a proxy for face-to-face contacts?* EPJ Data Science, 7, 1–18.

12. **Face-to-Face Interactions in a High School**: Interactions among students in a high school.
    - Citation: Mastrandrea, R., Fournet, J. & Barrat, A. (2015). *Contact patterns in a high school: a comparison between data collected using wearable sensors, contact diaries and friendship surveys*. PloS one, 10, e0136497.

13. **Human Proximity Recorded by Smart Devices**: This dataset captures human proximity data collected via smart devices.
    - Citation: Chaintreau, A. et al. (2007). *Impact of human mobility on opportunistic forwarding algorithms*. IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing, 6, 606–620.

After identifying these datasets and their citations, I will compile them into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations.
