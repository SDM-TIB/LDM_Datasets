To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Generalizing Tensor Decomposition for N-ary Relational Knowledge Bases" by Yu Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions "extensive evaluations on two representative n-ary relational KB datasets," which indicates that datasets are indeed discussed. I will look for specific names or descriptions of these datasets.

Next, I will examine **section 5 (Experiments and Results)**, as this section typically contains detailed information about the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, the authors explicitly list the datasets they used, which include:

1. **WikiPeople-3**: A dataset extracted from Wikidata concerning entities of type human, filtered to include only 3-ary relational facts.
2. **WikiPeople-4**: Similar to WikiPeople-3 but includes 4-ary relational facts.
3. **JF17K-3**: A dataset developed from Freebase, filtered to include only 3-ary relational facts.
4. **JF17K-4**: The 4-ary version of the JF17K dataset.
5. **Synthetic10-3**: A synthetic dataset with randomly generated 3-ary relational facts.
6. **Synthetic10-4**: A synthetic dataset with randomly generated 4-ary relational facts.
7. **WN18**: A binary relational dataset that is a subset of WordNet.
8. **FB15k**: A binary relational dataset that is a subset of Freebase.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. 

For example, the citations for the datasets might look like this:

- **WikiPeople**: 
  > Saiping Guan, Xiaolong Jin, Yuanzhuo Wang, and Xueqi Cheng. *Link Prediction on N-ary Relational Data*. In Proceedings of the World Wide Web Conference (WWW), 2019.

- **JF17K**: 
  > Richong Zhang, Junpeng Li, Jiajie Mei, and Yongyi Mao. *Scalable Instance Reconstruction in Knowledge Bases via Relatedness Affiliated Embedding*. In Proceedings of the World Wide Web Conference (WWW), 2018.

- **WN18**: 
  > Antoine Bordes, Nicolas Usunier, Alberto Garcia-Duran, Jason Weston, and Oksana Yakhnenko. *Translating Embeddings for Modeling Multi-relational Data*. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS), 2013.

- **FB15k**: 
  > Antoine Bordes, Nicolas Usunier, Alberto Garcia-Duran, Jason Weston, and Oksana Yakhnenko. *A Semantic Matching Energy Function for Learning with Multi-relational Data*. In Machine Learning, 2014.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described accurately and includes its full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details and that the citations are complete and correctly formatted.
