To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Pri3D: Can 3D Priors Help 2D Representation Learning?" by Ji Hou et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of RGB-D datasets for pre-training, which suggests that datasets are involved, but I need to find specific names.

Next, I will look into the **methodology sections**, particularly the sections that describe the experimental setup and datasets used. In the paper, the authors mention using **ScanNet** for pre-training and also reference **NYUv2** for downstream tasks. This indicates that both datasets are crucial for their experiments.

In the **experimental setup section**, the authors provide details about how they utilize the ScanNet dataset, which contains 2.5 million images from 1513 video sequences. They also mention that they sample every 25th frame for their experiments, confirming the dataset's relevance.

I will also check the **related work** and **results sections** to ensure that no additional datasets are overlooked. The authors reference RGB-D datasets in general, but the specific datasets of interest remain ScanNet and NYUv2.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to gather the full citations for these datasets:

1. **ScanNet**: The citation is:
   > Angela Dai, Angel X Chang, Manolis Savva, Maciej Halber, Thomas Funkhouser, and Matthias NieÃŸner. *ScanNet: Richly-annotated 3D reconstructions of indoor scenes*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2017.

2. **NYUv2**: The citation is:
   > Nathan Silberman, Derek Hoiem, Pushmeet Kohli, and Rob Fergus. *Indoor segmentation and support inference from RGB-D images*. In European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), 2012.

Having gathered the necessary information, I will now prepare to create structured entries for each dataset, ensuring that I include the full citations as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research.
