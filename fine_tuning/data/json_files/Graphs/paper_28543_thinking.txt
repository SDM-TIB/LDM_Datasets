To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Recognizing Vector Graphics without Rasterization" by Xinyang Jiang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of vector graphics for object localization and classification, which suggests that datasets are involved. 

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used. In section 4.2, they state that they used two datasets: **floorplans** and **diagrams**. I will extract the details provided for each dataset:

1. **Floorplans Dataset**: This dataset includes vector graphics for floorplans, containing 1,000 images with a total of 28,065 objects across 16 categories (e.g., armchair, tables, windows). The dataset is split into training and validation/test sets.

2. **Diagrams Dataset**: This dataset consists of vector graphics for diagrams, containing 1,000 images with a total of 14,100 objects across 21 categories (e.g., diode, resistor). The dataset is also split into training, validation, and test sets.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The paper mentions that the datasets are part of the SESYD database, which is a public database for vector graphic documents. 

The citation for the SESYD database is:
> Mathieu Delalandre. *SESYD: A Public Database for Vector Graphics Object Detection*. Available at: http://mathieu.delalandre.free.fr/projects/sesyd/

With this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations as required.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for further processing or review.
