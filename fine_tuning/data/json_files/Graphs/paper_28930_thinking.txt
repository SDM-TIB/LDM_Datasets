To extract datasets from the research paper titled "FEDGCN: Convergence and Communication Tradeoffs in Federated Training of Graph Convolutional Networks" by Yuhang Yao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on "synthetic and real-world datasets," which indicates that there are datasets used in their research. I will look for specific names or descriptions of these datasets.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section 6) in detail, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention using the **Cora**, **Citeseer**, **Pubmed**, and **OGBN-ArXiv** datasets. I will note down the details provided for each dataset, including the number of nodes, edges, features, and classes, as these are important for understanding the context in which the datasets were used.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily. 

For the datasets mentioned:
1. **Cora Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Sen, P., Namata, G., Bilgic, M., Getoor, L., Galligher, B., & Eliassi-Rad, T. (2008). *Collective classification in network data*. AI Magazine, 29(3), 93-93.

2. **Citeseer Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Wang, K., Shen, Z., Huang, C., Wu, C.-H., Dong, Y., & Kanakia, A. (2020). *Microsoft academic graph: When experts are not enough*. Quantitative Science Studies, 1(1), 396-413.

3. **Pubmed Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Hu, W., Fey, M., Zitnik, M., Dong, Y., Ren, H., Liu, B., Catasta, M., & Leskovec, J. (2020). *Open graph benchmark: Datasets for machine learning on graphs*. Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 33, 22118-22133.

4. **OGBN-ArXiv Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Hu, W., Fey, M., Zitnik, M., Dong, Y., Ren, H., Liu, B., Catasta, M., & Leskovec, J. (2020). *Open graph benchmark: Datasets for machine learning on graphs*. Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 33, 22118-22133.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset along with its citation. This will ensure that the extraction is complete and ready for any further processing or review.
