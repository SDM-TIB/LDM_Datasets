To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Build2Vec: Building Representation in Vector Space" by Mahmoud M. Abdelrahman et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and conclusion sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the methodology and case study, which may hint at the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of data generated in the building industry, particularly focusing on spatial and temporal data. They mention the use of Building Information Models (BIM) and IoT sensors, which suggests that these could be potential datasets.

Next, I will examine the **methodology section**, specifically the **2.2 Data sources** subsection, where the authors outline three main sources of data used in their study:

1. **Spatial data**: This is derived from the IFC file of the BIM model of the SDE4 building.
2. **Temporal data**: This data comes from sensors deployed in the building, capturing various environmental metrics.
3. **Occupant comfort feedback data**: This data is collected from participants who provided feedback on their comfort levels during an experiment.

The paper does not provide specific dataset names or links, but it does describe the types of data collected. Therefore, I will need to provide a general description of these datasets.

Now, I will look into the **References section** to find any relevant citations that could serve as authoritative sources for the datasets mentioned. The references include works related to BIM and IoT, which may provide context or additional information about the datasets used.

For the **IFC file**, I will cite the following reference:
- Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) - buildingSMART Technical.

For the **YAK app**, which is used for indoor positioning and collecting occupant feedback, I will cite:
- M. M. Abdelrahman, P. Jayathissa, and C. Miller. *YAK: An Indoor Positioning App for Spatial-Temporal Indoor Environmental Quality Research*, 2019.

The paper does not provide specific citations for the sensor data, but I can mention that it is derived from Building Management System (BMS) sensors and other IoT devices.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for the datasets that have been referenced in the paper. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research.
