To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MAGNOLIA: Matching Algorithms via GNNs for Online Value-to-go Approximation" by Alexandre Hayderi et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the application of the proposed method in various digital marketplaces, which suggests that datasets may be involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, characteristics, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find the following datasets mentioned:

1. **OSMnx Rideshare Dataset**: This dataset is generated using the OSMnx library and simulates a ridesharing application. It includes drivers and riders with edges representing the time to drive between intersections. The dataset is described in detail in Section B.2.2.

2. **gMission Dataset**: This dataset is used for spatial crowdsourcing, where offline workers are matched to tasks that arrive online. The edges represent the ability of workers to perform tasks, and the weights are based on expected payoffs. This dataset is also detailed in Section B.2.2.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

- For the **OSMnx Rideshare Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Geoff Boeing. OSMnx: New methods for acquiring, constructing, analyzing, and visualizing complex street networks. *Computers, Environment and Urban Systems*, 65:126–139, 2017.

- For the **gMission Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Zhao Chen, Rui Fu, Ziyuan Zhao, Zheng Liu, Leihao Xia, Lei Chen, Peng Cheng, Caleb Chen Cao, Yongxin Tong, and Chen Jason Zhang. gmission: A general spatial crowdsourcing platform. *Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment*, 7(13):1629–1632, 2014.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described accurately and includes the full citation for proper referencing.
