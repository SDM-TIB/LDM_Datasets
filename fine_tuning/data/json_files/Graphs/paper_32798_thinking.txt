To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The Map Equation Goes Neural: Mapping Network Flows with Graph Neural Networks" by Christopher BlÃ¶cker et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental evaluation sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their method on **synthetic and real-world datasets**, which indicates that datasets are indeed involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental evaluation section (Section 5)**, where the authors describe their experiments in detail. Here, they mention evaluating their method on **hundreds of synthetic and ten real datasets**. I will look for specific names of these datasets.

In **Table 1**, the authors provide a summary of the properties of the ten real-world datasets used in their experiments. The datasets listed are:

1. **Cora**: An undirected dataset with 2,708 nodes, 5,278 edges, 1,433 node features, 7 communities, and a mixing parameter of 0.19.
2. **CiteSeer**: An undirected dataset with 3,327 nodes, 4,614 edges, 3,703 node features, 6 communities, and a mixing parameter of 0.26.
3. **Pubmed**: An undirected dataset with 19,717 nodes, 44,325 edges, 500 node features, 3 communities, and a mixing parameter of 0.20.
4. **Amazon Computer (PC)**: An undirected dataset with 13,752 nodes, 143,604 edges, 767 node features, 10 communities, and a mixing parameter of 0.22.
5. **Amazon Photo**: An undirected dataset with 7,650 nodes, 71,831 edges, 745 node features, 8 communities, and a mixing parameter of 0.17.
6. **Coauthor CS**: An undirected dataset with 18,333 nodes, 81,894 edges, 6,805 node features, 15 communities, and a mixing parameter of 0.19.
7. **Coauthor Physics**: An undirected dataset with 34,493 nodes, 247,962 edges, 8,415 node features, 5 communities, and a mixing parameter of 0.07.
8. **Cora ML**: An undirected dataset with 2,995 nodes, 8,416 edges, 2,879 node features, 7 communities, and a mixing parameter of 0.21.
9. **Wiki CS**: A directed dataset with 11,701 nodes, 297,110 edges, 300 node features, 10 communities, and a mixing parameter of 0.31.
10. **ogb-arxiv**: A directed dataset with 169,343 nodes, 583,121 edges, 128 node features, 40 communities, and a mixing parameter of 0.35.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets are typically found in the papers or sources from which they originate. However, the paper does not provide explicit citations for each dataset in the text, so I will need to look up the original sources for each dataset.

For example, the Cora dataset is often cited as:
> Sen, P., Wang, J., & Zhao, J. (2008). *Collective classification in networked data*. In Proceedings of the 2008 SIAM International Conference on Data Mining.

I will repeat this process for each dataset mentioned in Table 1 to ensure I have the correct citations.

After gathering all the dataset names and their corresponding citations, I will compile them into a structured format for easy reference and use in future analyses or applications.
