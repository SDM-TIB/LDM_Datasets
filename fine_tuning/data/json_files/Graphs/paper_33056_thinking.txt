To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Contrastive Multi-Level Graph Neural Networks for Session-based Recommendation" by Fuyun Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract states that the authors conducted experiments on "multiple widely used benchmark datasets," which indicates that datasets are involved, but I need to find their specific names.

Next, I will focus on **section IV (Experiments)**, where the authors provide details about the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention three datasets:

1. **Tmall Dataset**: This dataset consists of 351,268 training sessions and 25,898 test sessions, with a total of 30,968 items and an average session length of 6.69.

2. **Diginetica Dataset**: This dataset includes 719,470 training sessions and 60,858 test sessions, with 40,728 items and an average session length of 5.12.

3. **Nowplaying Dataset**: This dataset has 825,304 training sessions and 89,824 test sessions, with 43,097 items and an average session length of 7.42.

The authors also provide a brief description of each dataset, including their sources and characteristics, which is crucial for understanding their context.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For the **Tmall Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Tmall Dataset. *Tianchi Dataset*. Available at: https://tianchi.aliyun.com/dataset/dataDetail?dataId=42.

- For the **Diginetica Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Diginetica Dataset. *CIKM Cup 2016 Dataset*. Available at: https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/11161.

- For the **Nowplaying Dataset**, the citation is:
  > E. Zangerle, M. Pichl, W. Gassler, and G. Specht. *# nowplaying music dataset: Extracting listening behavior from twitter*. In Proceedings of the first international workshop on internet-scale multimedia management, 2014, pp. 21â€“26.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all relevant details are captured for future reference or processing.
