To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Selective Attention Based Graph Convolutional Networks for Aspect-Level Sentiment Classification" by Xiaochen Hou et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction typically outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of aspect-level sentiment classification and mention that they conduct experiments on several benchmark datasets. This indicates that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors provide a table (Table 1) listing the datasets used. The datasets mentioned are:

1. **Laptop reviews from SemEval 2014 Task 4 (14Lap)**: This dataset contains reviews specifically focused on laptops.
2. **Restaurant reviews from SemEval 2014 Task 4 (14Rest)**: This dataset includes reviews of restaurants.
3. **Restaurant reviews from SemEval 2015 Task 12 (15Rest)**: Another dataset focused on restaurant reviews, but from a different task.
4. **Restaurant reviews from SemEval 2016 Task 5 (16Rest)**: This dataset also contains restaurant reviews from yet another task.

The paper provides statistics for each dataset, including the number of training and testing samples, which confirms their relevance for the experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the SemEval datasets are typically included in the proceedings of the respective conferences. I will look for the following references:

- For **SemEval 2014 Task 4**, the citation is:
  > Pontiki, M., Galanis, D., Karkaletsis, V., & Koutkias, V. (2014). *SemEval-2014 Task 4: Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis*. In Proceedings of the 8th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval 2014), pages 27-35.

- For **SemEval 2015 Task 12**, the citation is:
  > D. Galanis, M. Pontiki, V. Koutkias, and V. Karkaletsis. (2015). *SemEval-2015 Task 12: Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis*. In Proceedings of the 9th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval 2015), pages 486-490.

- For **SemEval 2016 Task 5**, the citation is:
  > D. Galanis, M. Pontiki, V. Koutkias, and V. Karkaletsis. (2016). *SemEval-2016 Task 5: Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis*. In Proceedings of the 10th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval 2016), pages 1-5.

With these citations, I can now compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for output, ensuring that they are structured clearly and include all necessary information for future reference or processing.
