To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Bridging the Fairness Divide: Achieving Group and Individual Fairness in Graph Neural Networks" by Duna Zhan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by scanning the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may highlight the datasets used for experiments. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets in relation to the research objectives.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **experiments**. In this paper, the authors mention using three public datasets in their experiments: **Pokec_n**, **NBA**, and **Credit**. I will carefully read the relevant sections to gather detailed descriptions of each dataset, including their characteristics and the specific attributes used in the study.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide a summary of the datasets, including their sizes and the sensitive attributes considered. I will note down the following details for each dataset:

1. **Pokec_n Dataset**: This dataset is derived from Slovakian social networks and includes various features such as gender, age, and educational background. The sensitive attribute is geographical region.

2. **NBA Dataset**: This dataset consists of data from 403 professional basketball players, including attributes like age, nationality, and salary. The sensitive attribute is nationality.

3. **Credit Dataset**: This dataset provides insights into consumer behavior, including features like spending habits and credit history. The sensitive attribute is age.

After identifying the datasets and their descriptions, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and should be formatted correctly.

The full citations I will extract are:

- For **Pokec_n Dataset**:
  > Takac, L., & Zabovsky, M. (2012). Data analysis in public social networks. In International scientific conference and international workshop present day trends of innovations, volume 1. Present Day Trends of Innovations Lamza Poland.

- For **NBA Dataset**:
  > Dai, E., & Wang, S. (2021). Say no to the discrimination: Learning fair graph neural networks with limited sensitive attribute information. In Proceedings of the 14th ACM International Conference on Web Search and Data Mining, pp. 680–688.

- For **Credit Dataset**:
  > Yeh, I.-C., & Lien, C.-H. (2009). The comparisons of data mining techniques for the predictive accuracy of probability of default of credit card clients. Expert systems with applications, 36(2), 2473–2480.

Finally, I will compile the extracted information into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that I have accurately represented the datasets used in the research.
