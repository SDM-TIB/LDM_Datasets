To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Enhancing O-RAN Security: Evasion Attacks and Robust Defenses for Graph Reinforcement Learning-based Connection Management" by Ravikumar Balakrishnan et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses adversarial machine learning in the context of O-RAN systems but does not explicitly mention datasets. I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** closely, as this is typically where datasets are detailed. I will look for any references to specific datasets used for training or evaluation, especially in the context of the experiments conducted on the GNN-based connection management xApp.

In the **experiments section**, the authors describe their evaluation setup, including the use of simulated networks with specific parameters (e.g., number of cells and user equipment). However, they do not mention any publicly available datasets or benchmarks. Instead, they seem to rely on their own simulation framework for testing the proposed methods.

Since no external datasets are cited in the paper, I will check the **references section** to see if any of the cited works include datasets that could be relevant. For example, the paper references previous works that may have used datasets related to wireless communication or machine learning in similar contexts.

After reviewing the references, I find that some of the cited works may have associated datasets, but the paper itself does not provide explicit dataset citations. Therefore, I will note that while the authors conducted experiments, they did not utilize any publicly available datasets, and thus, there are no dataset citations to extract.

In conclusion, I will summarize my findings:
- The paper does not mention any specific datasets used for experiments.
- The authors rely on a simulation framework rather than external datasets.
- No dataset citations can be provided as none are referenced in the paper.

This process highlights the importance of thoroughly reviewing each section of the paper to identify any potential datasets, even if they are not explicitly stated. In this case, the lack of datasets means there are no citations to compile.
