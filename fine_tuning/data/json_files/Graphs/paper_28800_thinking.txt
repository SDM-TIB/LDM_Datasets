To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Bayesian Graph Contrastive Learning" by Arman Hasanzadeh et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors demonstrate their model's performance on several benchmark datasets, which indicates that datasets are likely discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they explicitly mention three datasets:

1. **Cora**: A citation dataset where each node represents a document, and edges indicate citation relationships. The dataset includes a multi-dimensional binary attribute vector for each document.

2. **Citeseer**: Similar to Cora, this is another citation dataset with nodes representing documents and edges indicating citation relationships. Each document is also represented by a multi-dimensional binary attribute vector.

3. **Amazon-Photos**: This dataset comes from the Amazon co-purchase graph, where nodes represent products and edges connect frequently purchased products. The products are classified into eight classes, and node attributes are based on a bag-of-words representation of product reviews.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide additional details about how they processed these datasets, including the splits for training and testing. This information is crucial for understanding the context in which the datasets were used.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **Cora**:
  > Sen, P., Namata, G., Bilgic, M., Getoor, L., Galligher, B., and Eliassi-Rad, T. (2008). *Collective classification in network data*. AI magazine, 29(3):93.

- For **Citeseer**:
  > Sen, P., Namata, G., Bilgic, M., Getoor, L., Galligher, B., and Eliassi-Rad, T. (2008). *Collective classification in network data*. AI magazine, 29(3):93.

- For **Amazon-Photos**:
  > McAuley, J., Targett, C., Shi, Q., and Van Den Hengel, A. (2015). *Image-based recommendations on styles and substitutes*. In Proceedings of the 38th international ACM SIGIR conference on research and development in information retrieval, pages 43â€“52.

With this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes the full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details or citations.
