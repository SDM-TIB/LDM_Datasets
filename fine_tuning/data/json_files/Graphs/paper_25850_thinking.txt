To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "Spectral Graph Convolutions for Population-based Disease Prediction" by Sarah Parisot et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors demonstrate their method on the **ADNI** and **ABIDE** databases, which suggests these are the primary datasets used.

Next, I will look closely at the **introduction** and **methods sections**. In the introduction, the authors mention using the **ABIDE database** to classify subjects as healthy or suffering from Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) and the **ADNI database** for predicting the conversion from Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) to Alzheimer's Disease (AD). This confirms that both datasets are central to their research.

In the **methods section**, the authors provide detailed descriptions of both datasets:

1. **ABIDE Database**: The paper states that the ABIDE database aggregates functional MRI and phenotypic data from 1112 subjects, with a specific focus on a subset of 871 subjects used for their analysis. This dataset is crucial for their classification task.

2. **ADNI Database**: The authors describe the ADNI database as comprising over 1700 adults, with a focus on a subset of 540 early/late MCI subjects. They highlight the longitudinal nature of the data, which is essential for their prediction task.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **ABIDE database**, the citation is:
  > Di Martino, A., Yan, C.G., Li, Q., Denio, E., Castellanos, F.X., et al. *The autism brain imaging data exchange: Towards a large-scale evaluation of the intrinsic brain architecture in autism*. Molecular Psychiatry 19(6), 659–667, 2014.

- For the **ADNI database**, the citation is:
  > Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. *The Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI): A longitudinal study of neuroimaging and clinical data*. Available at: http://adni.loni.usc.edu.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets:

1. **ABIDE Database**: A dataset containing functional MRI and phenotypic data from 1112 subjects, focusing on a subset of 871 subjects for classification tasks related to Autism Spectrum Disorders.

2. **ADNI Database**: A longitudinal dataset with over 1700 adults, focusing on a subset of 540 early/late MCI subjects, used for predicting the conversion to Alzheimer's Disease.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its full citation.
