To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Comprehensive Time-Series Regression Models Using Gretlâ€”U.S. GDP and Government Consumption Expenditures & Gross Investment from 1980 to 2013" by Juehui Shi, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the paper analyzes U.S. GDP and government expenditures from 1980 to 2013, suggesting that these are the primary datasets.

Next, I will look for specific sections that might detail the datasets used. The **Methodology** section provides insights into the data sources. It mentions two key datasets:

1. **GDPC1Q**: This dataset represents the U.S. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in billions of chained 2005 dollars, covering the period from 1980 Q1 to 2006 Q1.
2. **GCEC1Q**: This dataset represents Government Consumption Expenditures and Gross Investment, also in billions of chained 2005 dollars, for the same period.

I will also check the **References** section to find full citations for these datasets. However, since these datasets are standard economic indicators, they may not have specific citations like research datasets. Instead, I will note that they are sourced from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA).

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring to include the dataset names, descriptions, and any relevant citations or sources.

The final entries for the datasets will be:

1. **Dataset Name**: GDPC1Q
   - **Description**: U.S. Gross Domestic Product in billions of chained 2005 dollars, covering the period from 1980 Q1 to 2006 Q1.
   - **Source**: U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA).

2. **Dataset Name**: GCEC1Q
   - **Description**: Government Consumption Expenditures and Gross Investment in billions of chained 2005 dollars, covering the same period.
   - **Source**: U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA).

After gathering all this information, I will ensure that the dataset entries are clear and concise, ready for any further processing or analysis.
