To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Progressive Proxy Anchor Propagation for Unsupervised Semantic Segmentation" by Hyun Seok Seong et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors validate their method on various datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed involved.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section** (section 4). In this section, the authors explicitly list the datasets used for evaluation:

1. **COCO-stuff**: This dataset is used for scene understanding tasks and consists of 172 classes. The authors mention that it is a benchmark for semantic segmentation, detection, and image captioning.

2. **Cityscapes**: Another large-scale dataset for scene understanding, consisting of 30 classes captured across 50 different cities. The authors specify that 27 subclasses are used for the benchmark.

3. **Potsdam-3**: This dataset contains satellite images divided into 3 classes.

4. **ImageNet-S**: A large-scale dataset with 1.2 million training images and 919 semantic classes.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **COCO-stuff**, the citation is:
  > Caesar, H., Uijlings, J., Ferrari, V. (2018). *Coco-stuff: Thing and stuff classes in context*. In Proceedings of the IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pp. 1209–1218.

- For **Cityscapes**, the citation is:
  > Cordts, M., Omran, M., Ramos, S., Rehfeld, T., Enzweiler, M., Benenson, R., Franke, U., Roth, S., Schiele, B. (2016). *The cityscapes dataset for semantic urban scene understanding*. In Proceedings of the IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pp. 3213–3223.

- For **Potsdam-3**, the citation is not explicitly mentioned in the provided text, so I will need to look it up separately to ensure I have the correct reference.

- For **ImageNet-S**, the citation is also not explicitly mentioned in the provided text, so I will need to look it up separately as well.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
