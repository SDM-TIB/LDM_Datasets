To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Comparison of Syntactic and Semantic Representations of Programs in Neural Embeddings" by Austin P. Wright, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and evaluation sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study and may mention specific datasets used. The introduction often outlines the context and significance of the research, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will focus on **section 3.2.1 (Dataset)**, where the author explicitly discusses the datasets used in the study. Here, I will find detailed descriptions of the datasets, including their names, purposes, and any relevant statistics.

The paper mentions two datasets:

1. **Natural Program Synthesis Dataset (NAPS)**: This dataset is designed to build a library of competitive programming solutions sourced from codeforces competitions. It consists of 16,410 training examples and 485 test examples, focusing on small, self-contained programming tasks.

2. **Java Open Source Data**: This dataset comprises 11 open-source Java projects from GitHub, selected based on popularity metrics such as watchers and forks. The projects contain a significant amount of source code and are used to analyze methods extracted from the raw Java classes.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For the **Natural Program Synthesis Dataset (NAPS)**, the citation is:
> Zavershynskyi, M., Skidanov, A., & Polosukhin, I. (2018). NAPS: Natural Program Synthesis Dataset. arXiv e-prints, page arXiv:1807.03168.

For the **Java Open Source Data**, the citation is:
> Allamanis, M., Peng, H., & Sutton, C. (2016). A convolutional attention network for extreme summarization of source code. In International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML).

Now that I have the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This structured approach will help in accurately documenting the datasets used in the research.
