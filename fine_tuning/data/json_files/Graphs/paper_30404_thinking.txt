To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multilingual Representation Distillation with Contrastive Learning" by Weiting Tan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the use of multilingual sentence representations and validates the approach with tasks involving parallel sentences. This suggests that datasets related to multilingual sentence pairs may be present.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. In section 3.1, the authors describe the datasets used for training, which include both clean data and back-translation data. They provide a table (Table 1) that lists the number of sentences available for different languages in clean bitext and back-translation datasets. This table is crucial as it gives specific details about the datasets.

The table indicates the following datasets:

1. **Clean Bitext Data (CB)**: This includes publicly available datasets such as jw300, bible, tatoeba, wikimedia, and others. The authors mention that these datasets are grouped together as clean data.

2. **Back-Translation Data (BT)**: The authors describe how they generate back-translation data using a translation model and monolingual data from sources like CommonCrawl and ParaCrawl.

Next, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The authors reference several sources for the clean data:

- For the **jw300 dataset**, the citation is:

- For the **bible dataset**, the citation is:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
