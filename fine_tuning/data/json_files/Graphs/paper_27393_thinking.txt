To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Lipschitz Normalization for Self-Attention Layers with Application to Graph Neural Networks" by George Dasoulas et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions the application of the proposed method to "node label prediction tasks" and "benchmark node classification tasks," which suggests that datasets are involved. I will look for specific names of datasets in these sections.

Next, I will proceed to the **experiments section (Section 7)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention using several datasets for node classification tasks. I will carefully note the names of these datasets and any relevant details provided.

From my reading, I identify the following datasets mentioned in the paper:

1. **Cora Dataset**: A citation network where nodes correspond to research publications and edges encode citation links. It contains 2,708 nodes, 5,429 edges, and 1,433 attributes.
   
2. **CiteSeer Dataset**: Another citation network with 3,327 nodes, 4,732 edges, and 3,703 attributes.

3. **PubMed Dataset**: A larger citation network with 19,717 nodes, 44,338 edges, and 500 attributes.

4. **Ogbn-arxiv Dataset**: A citation network with directed edges, containing 169,343 nodes and 1,166,243 edges, with node attributes being averaged word embeddings of titles and abstracts.

5. **Ogbn-proteins Dataset**: A protein interactions network with 132,534 nodes and 39,561,252 edges, where each node represents a protein and each edge indicates biological interactions.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and will be formatted as follows:

- For the **Cora Dataset**:
  > McCallum, A. K., Nigam, K., Rennie, J., & Seymore, K. (2000). Automating the construction of internet portals with machine learning. *Information Retrieval*, 3(2), 127-163.

- For the **CiteSeer Dataset**:
  > Giles, C., Bollacker, K., & Lawrence, S. (1998). Citeseer: An automatic citation indexing system. In *Proceedings of the ACM International Conference on Digital Libraries* (pp. 89-98).

- For the **PubMed Dataset**:
  > McCallum, A. K., Nigam, K., Rennie, J., & Seymore, K. (2000). Automating the construction of internet portals with machine learning. *Information Retrieval*, 3(2), 127-163.

- For the **Ogbn-arxiv Dataset**:
  > Hu, W., Fey, M., Zitnik, M., Dong, Y., Ren, H., Liu, B., Catasta, M., & Leskovec, J. (2020). Open graph benchmark: Datasets for machine learning on graphs. *CoRR*.

- For the **Ogbn-proteins Dataset**:
  > Hu, W., Fey, M., Zitnik, M., Dong, Y., Ren, H., Liu, B., Catasta, M., & Leskovec, J. (2020). Open graph benchmark: Datasets for machine learning on graphs. *CoRR*.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I accurately capture all relevant information regarding the datasets used in the research paper.
