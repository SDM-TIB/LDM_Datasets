To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Contrastive-Based Deep Embeddings for Label Noise-Resilient Histopathology Image Classification" by Lucas Dedieu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract highlights the evaluation of their method across multiple datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets and Pre-processing)**, as this section is likely to contain the most comprehensive information about the datasets used in the experiments. Here, the authors list six public benchmark datasets:

1. **NCT-CRC-HE-100K**: This dataset consists of 100,000 hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained images of human colorectal cancer, divided into 9 tissue classes. The training set has 80,000 images, with a validation set of 20,000 images and a test set of 7,180 images.

2. **PatchCamelyon**: This dataset contains 327,680 stained patches derived from histopathological scans of lymph node sections, with a patch size of 96x96. It includes training, validation, and test sets.

3. **BACH**: Composed of H&E stained breast histology microscopy patches, this dataset has 320 images for training and 83 for testing, categorized into four classes based on cancer type.

4. **MHIST**: This dataset consists of 3,152 H&E stained images of colorectal polyps, split into training (2,175 images) and testing (977 images) sets.

5. **LC25000**: This dataset contains 5,000 images of lung and colon tissues, divided into five classes. The images are 768x768 pixels in size.

6. **GasHisSDB**: Comprising 32,284 H&E stained gastric cancer pathology patches, this dataset is categorized into abnormal and normal classes.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
