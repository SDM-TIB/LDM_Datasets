To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Word Frequency and Sentiment Analysis of Twitter Messages During Coronavirus Pandemic" by Nikhil Kumar Rajput et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the paper presents a statistical analysis of Twitter messages related to the Coronavirus pandemic, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will examine **section 3 (Statistical analysis of tweets)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their analysis. They mention that four datasets were utilized:

1. **Twitter Id Evolution Dataset**: This dataset reflects the number of Twitter IDs tweeting about Coronavirus over time. It captures the evolution of tweets during the pandemic.

2. **Unigram Frequencies Dataset**: This dataset contains the top 1000 unigrams (single words) extracted from the tweets, which are analyzed for their frequency of occurrence.

3. **Bigram Frequencies Dataset**: Similar to the unigram dataset, this dataset includes the top 1000 bigrams (two-word combinations) from the tweets.

4. **Trigram Frequencies Dataset**: This dataset consists of the top 1000 trigrams (three-word combinations) from the tweets.

In **section 5 (Sentiment Analysis of Twitter Messages)**, the authors mention two specific datasets used for sentiment analysis:

1. **WHO Tweets Dataset**: This dataset includes tweets made by the World Health Organization (WHO) regarding the Coronavirus.

2. **High Retweet Tweets Dataset**: This dataset contains tweets that have been retweeted more than 1000 times, which indicates their popularity and relevance.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper cites a specific dataset for Twitter messages:

- For the **Twitter Dataset** used in the analysis, the citation is:
  > Juan M. Banda, Ramya Tekumalla, Guanyu Wang, Jingyuan Yu, Tuo Liu, Yuning Ding, and Gerardo Chowell. *A Twitter Dataset of 100+ million tweets related to COVID-19, March 2020*. This dataset will be updated bi-weekly at least with additional tweets, look at the GitHub repo for these updates.

With this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and includes the full citation as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
