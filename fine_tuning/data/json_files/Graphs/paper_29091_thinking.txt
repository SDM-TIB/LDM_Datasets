To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Continual Learning of Multi-modal Dynamics with External Memory" by Abdullah Akgül et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and while it may not explicitly mention datasets, it sets the context for the research. The introduction often discusses the motivation behind the study and may reference specific datasets used in prior work or in the current experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this paper, the authors mention evaluating their model on **two real-world time series classification datasets** and **three synthetic datasets**. This indicates that there are multiple datasets to extract.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets:

1. **Synthetic Datasets**:
   - **Sine Waves**: This dataset consists of signals grouped into modes described by different magnitudes and frequencies, generated from the function Asin(2π f t).
   - **Lotka-Volterra**: This dataset is based on the dynamics of predator and prey populations, modeled by nonlinear differential equations.
   - **Lorenz Attractor**: A three-dimensional nonlinear dynamical system used to model atmospheric convection, with modes defined by different parameter settings.

2. **Real-World Datasets**:
   - **Libras Movement Dataset**: This dataset consists of sequences of (x, y) coordinates of hand movements from 15 different classes, representing Brazilian sign language.
   - **Character Trajectories Dataset**: This dataset includes sequences of velocities of (x, y) coordinates and pen force collected from handwriting samples of 20 English alphabet characters.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For the **Libras Movement Dataset**, the citation is:
> Dua, D., Graff, C. (2017). UCI machine learning repository. URL: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml.

For the **Character Trajectories Dataset**, the citation is also:
> Dua, D., Graff, C. (2017). UCI machine learning repository. URL: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml.

The synthetic datasets do not have specific citations as they are generated based on mathematical models described in the paper.

Finally, I will compile the extracted information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will facilitate easy reference and further research.
