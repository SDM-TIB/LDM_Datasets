To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Semi-Supervised Learning for Mars Imagery Classification and Segmentation" by Wenjing Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the paper focuses on Mars imagery classification and segmentation, which suggests that specific datasets related to Mars imagery will be discussed.

Next, I will examine **section 3 (Mars Imagery Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they describe two datasets:

1. **MSL Surface Dataset**: This dataset consists of 6,691 images collected by three instruments of the Curiosity Rover, categorized into 24 classes. The authors mention that the training and evaluation data are split by Mars solar day (sol), with specific sol ranges designated for training and testing.

2. **AI4Mars Dataset**: This dataset is described as a large-scale dataset for terrain classification and segmentation, containing 35,000 images collected from various Mars rovers through crowdsourcing. The authors emphasize the quality of annotations, which are based on the views of approximately ten people.

To confirm the details and obtain full citations, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper:

- For the **MSL Surface Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Kiri L. Wagstaff, You Lu, Alice Stanboli, Kevin Grimes, Thamme Gowda, and Jordan Padams. *Deep Mars: CNN Classification of Mars Imagery for the PDS Imaging Atlas*. In Conference on Innovative Applications of Artificial Intelligence, 2018.

- For the **AI4Mars Dataset**, the citation is:
  > R. Michael Swan, Deegan Atha, Henry A. Leopold, Matthew Gildner, Stephanie Oij, Cindy Chiu, and Masahiro Ono. *AI4MARS: A Dataset for Terrain-Aware Autonomous Driving on Mars*. In IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops, 2021.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and that the full citations are included. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research, ready for further processing or review.
