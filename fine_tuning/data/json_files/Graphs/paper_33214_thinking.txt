To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MuSe-GNN: Learning Unified Gene Representation From Multimodal Biological Graph Data" by Tianyu Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors leveraged "82 training datasets from 10 tissues, three sequencing techniques, and three species." This indicates that multiple datasets are involved, but I need to find specific names and details.

Next, I will examine the **Methods** section, particularly the subsections that discuss data collection and preprocessing. Here, the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments, including single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and spatial transcriptomics data. I will look for specific dataset names and any relevant details about their characteristics.

In the **Experiments** section, the authors provide insights into how they utilized these datasets for their model training and evaluation. I will pay attention to any references to specific datasets used in their benchmarking analysis.

I will also check the **Appendix** for any additional information regarding datasets, as it often contains supplementary details that may not be included in the main text.

Once I have identified the datasets, I will compile the full citations for each dataset from the **References section**. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access the datasets.

Based on the information gathered, I will summarize each dataset, including its name, description, and citation. The citations will be formatted according to academic standards to ensure clarity and consistency.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This will facilitate easy access and reference for future research or analysis.
