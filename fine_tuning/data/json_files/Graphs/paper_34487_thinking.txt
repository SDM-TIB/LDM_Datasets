To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Letâ€™s Fuse Step by Step: A Generative Fusion Decoding Algorithm with LLMs for Multi-modal Text Recognition" by Chan-Jan Hsu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** to find any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the evaluation demonstrates significant improvements in ASR and OCR tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiment)**, where the authors detail their experimental setup. Here, they mention several datasets used for evaluation:

1. **Librispeech**: A collection of corpus from audiobooks with subsets Clean and Other. It is used for evaluating ASR performance.
2. **Medical Dataset**: Contains 8.5 hours of medical conversations with associated symptom tags, also used for ASR.
3. **ATCO2**: Contains audios of air traffic control communication, used for ASR.
4. **Fleurs**: A multilingual speech corpus, specifically the Cantonese subset is used for evaluation.
5. **NTUML2021**: A corpus consisting of lecture recordings from a machine learning course, used for ASR.
6. **FormosaSpeech**: A dataset of Chinese recordings with Taiwanese accents, used for ASR.
7. **NAF (National Archive Forms)**: A dataset consisting of images from U.S. national archives, used for OCR.

In the **results section**, the authors provide performance metrics for these datasets, confirming their use in the experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. Here are the citations I will extract:

- For **Librispeech**, the citation is:
  > Kyu J. Han, Ramon Prieto, Kaixing Wu, and Tao Ma. *State-of-the-Art Speech Recognition Using Multi-Stream Self-Attention With Dilated 1D Convolutions*. arXiv:1910.00716, 2019.

- For the **Medical Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Figure Eight Inc. *Medical Speech, Transcription, and Intent*. 2019.

- For **ATCO2**, the citation is:
  > Igor Szoke, Santosh Kesiraju, Ondrej Novotny, Martin Kocour, Karel Vesely, and Jan "Honza" Cernocky. *Detecting English Speech in the Air Traffic Control Voice Communication*. arXiv:2104.02332, 2021.

- For **Fleurs**, the citation is:

- For **NTUML2021**, the citation is:
  > Chih-Kai Yang, Kuan-Po Huang, Ke-Han Lu, Chun-Yi Kuan, Chi-Yuan Hsiao, and Hung-yi Lee. *Investigating Zero-Shot Generalizability on Mandarin-English Code-Switched ASR and Speech-to-text Translation of Recent Foundation Models with Self-Supervision and Weak Supervision*. arXiv:2401.00273, 2023.

- For **FormosaSpeech**, the citation is:
  > Chan-Jan Hsu, Chang-Le Liu, Feng-Ting Liao, Po-Chun Hsu, Yi-Chang Chen, and Da-Shan Shiu. *Breeze-7B Technical Report*. arXiv:2403.02712, 2024.

- For **NAF**, the citation is:
  > Brian Davis, Bryan Morse, Scott Cohen, Brian Price, and Chris Tensmeyer. *Deep Visual Template-Free Form Parsing*. arXiv:1909.02576, 2019.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations into a structured format for further processing or review.
