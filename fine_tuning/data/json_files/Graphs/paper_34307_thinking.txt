To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Prototypical Expert-Driven Approach Towards Capability-Based Monitoring of Automated Driving Systems" by Richard Schubert et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract discusses the implementation of an online capability monitor and mentions the UNICARagil research project, which may imply the use of specific datasets related to automated driving systems. I will look for any explicit references to datasets or data sources.

Next, I will examine the **methodology** and **experiments** sections, as these typically contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the research. I will look for any sections that specifically mention datasets, such as "Data Collection," "Dataset Description," or similar headings. 

In the **experiments** section, I will pay close attention to any descriptions of the data used for evaluating the proposed framework. If the authors mention recorded data from the UNICARagil vehicle, I will note the specifics of this data, including the type of data (e.g., sensor data, performance measures) and the context in which it was collected.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references** section for any citations related to the datasets mentioned. If the authors refer to existing datasets or studies, I will ensure to extract the full citation for each dataset, as this is crucial for proper attribution.

For example, if the paper mentions using data from the UNICARagil project, I will look for the original source or documentation that describes this dataset. If the dataset is publicly available, I will include the link or DOI if provided.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, I will compile the details, including the dataset name, description, and full citation, ensuring that each entry is complete and accurately reflects the information presented in the paper.

Finally, I will organize this information in a clear format for easy reference, ensuring that all citations are correctly formatted according to academic standards.
