To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Mask-guided BERT for Few Shot Text Classification" by Wenxiong Liao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that experimental results are demonstrated on "public-domain benchmark datasets," which indicates that datasets are indeed used in the study. I will look for specific names or descriptions of these datasets.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section IV) where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they summarize six datasets, which include both open-domain and medical-domain datasets. I will note down the names and any relevant details provided for each dataset.

The datasets mentioned in the paper are:

1. **AG News**: A text classification dataset containing 4 news categories.
2. **DBpedia14**: A text classification dataset with 14 categories.
3. **Snippets**: A dataset of web search snippets retrieved from Google Search.
4. **Symptoms**: A dataset published on Kaggle containing audio data of common medical symptom descriptions, which after preprocessing includes 231 samples of 7 symptom categories.
5. **PubMed20k**: A dataset based on PubMed for sequence classification.
6. **NICTA-PIBOSO**: A dataset based on the ALTA 2012 Shared Task for classifying sentences in biomedical abstracts into predefined categories.

Now, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and will be formatted as follows:

- For **AG News**, the citation is:
  > Zhang, Y., Zhao, J., & LeCun, Y. (2015). Character-level convolutional networks for text classification. *Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems*, 28.

- For **DBpedia14**, the citation is:
  > Lehmann, J., Iannone, L., & Auer, S. (2015). DBpedia: A large-scale, multilingual knowledge base extracted from Wikipedia. *Semantic Web*, 6(2), 167-195.

- For **Snippets**, the citation is:
  > Phan, X.-H., Nguyen, L.-M., & Horiguchi, S. (2008). Learning to classify short and sparse text & web with hidden topics from large-scale data collections. In *Proceedings of the 17th International Conference on World Wide Web* (pp. 91-100).

- For **Symptoms**, the citation is:
  > Mooney, P. T. (2020). Medical Speech Transcription and Intent. *Kaggle Dataset*. Retrieved from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/medical-speech-transcription-and-intent.

- For **PubMed20k**, the citation is:
  > Dernoncourt, F., & Lee, J. Y. (2017). PubMed 200k RCT: A dataset for sequential sentence classification in medical abstracts. In *Proceedings of the Eighth International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing* (pp. 308-313).

- For **NICTA-PIBOSO**, the citation is:
  > Amini, I., Martinez, D., & Molla, D. (2012). Overview of the ALTA 2012 Shared Task. *ALTA 2012 Shared Task*.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations to ensure that they are ready for any further processing or review.
