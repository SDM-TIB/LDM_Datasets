To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MixCo: Mix-up Contrastive Learning for Visual Representation" by Sungnyun Kim et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. In the abstract, the authors mention validating their method on **TinyImageNet, CIFAR10, and CIFAR100**. This indicates that these datasets are likely used in their experiments.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (section 4) to find detailed descriptions of how these datasets were utilized. In section 4.1, the authors specify that they trained their models on **TinyImageNet** and evaluated them on **CIFAR10** and **CIFAR100**. This confirms that all three datasets are indeed part of their experimental setup.

Now, I will gather more specific details about each dataset from the text:

1. **TinyImageNet**: The paper mentions that TinyImageNet is used for pretraining the ResNet encoder. It is a smaller version of the ImageNet dataset, containing 200 classes with 500 training images per class.

2. **CIFAR10**: This dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes, with 6,000 images per class. It is commonly used for benchmarking machine learning algorithms.

3. **CIFAR100**: Similar to CIFAR10, this dataset contains 60,000 images but is divided into 100 classes, with 600 images per class.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **TinyImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Ya Le and Xuan Yang. *Tiny ImageNet Visual Recognition Challenge*. CS 231N, 7, 2015.

- For **CIFAR10**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton, et al. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009.

- For **CIFAR100**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton, et al. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. This will ensure that I have accurately captured all necessary details for each dataset used in the research.
