To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Causal Disentangled Multi-Granularity Graph Classification Method" by Yuan Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors compare their model against three real-world datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experiment)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention:

1. **MUTAG**: This dataset contains 188 compounds labeled based on whether they have a mutagenic effect on a bacterium.
2. **PTC**: This dataset consists of 344 organic molecules labeled according to their carcinogenicity on male mice.
3. **IMDB-M**: This dataset is a movie collaboration dataset categorized by the genre of the ego-network (romance, action, and science).

The details provided in this section confirm the datasets used in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **MUTAG**, the citation is:
  > Debnath, A.K., Lopez de Compadre, R.L., Debnath, G., Shusterman, A.J., and Hansch, C. (1991). *Structure-activity relationship of mutagenic aromatic and heteroaromatic nitro compounds. Correlation with molecular orbital energies and hydrophobicity*. Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, 34(2), 786–797.

- For **PTC**, the citation is:
  > Toivonen, H., Srinivasan, A., King, R.D., Kramer, S., and Helma, C. (2003). *Statistical evaluation of the predictive toxicology challenge 2000-2001*. Bioinformatics, 19(10), 1183–1193.

- For **IMDB-M**, the citation is:
  > Rossi, R.A., and Ahmed, N.K. (2015). *The network data repository with interactive graph analytics and visualization*. In Proceedings of the Twenty-Ninth AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, 4292–4293.

With this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes its full citation. This will allow for proper referencing and acknowledgment of the datasets used in the research.
