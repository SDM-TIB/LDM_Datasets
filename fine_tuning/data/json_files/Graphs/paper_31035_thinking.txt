To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Temporal Perceiving Video-Language Pre-training" by Fan Ma et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the introduction of a novel task for video-language pre-training, but it does not specify datasets. Therefore, I will look for explicit mentions in the introduction.

In the **introduction**, the authors reference the use of large-scale multi-modal data for pre-training video-language models, but again, no specific datasets are named. I will continue to the **experiments section**, which is likely to contain more detailed information about the datasets used.

In **section 4.1 (Datasets and Downstream Tasks)**, the authors explicitly mention two datasets used for pre-training:

1. **WebVid**: This dataset consists of 2.5 million video-text pairs. It is used for training the model to understand the relationship between video content and textual descriptions.

2. **Google Conceptual Captions (CC3M)**: This dataset contains approximately 3 million image-text pairs, where static images are treated as single-frame videos during pre-training.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **WebVid**, the citation is:
  > Miech, A., Alayrac, J.-B., Smaira, L., Laptev, I., Sivic, J., & Zisserman, A. (2020). End-to-end learning of visual representations from uncurated instructional videos. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 9879â€“9889.

- For **Google Conceptual Captions (CC3M)**, the citation is:
  > Sharma, P., Ding, N., Goodman, S., & Soricut, R. (2018). Conceptual captions: A cleaned, hypernymed, image alt-text dataset for automatic image captioning. In ACL, pages 2018.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their respective citations from the paper.
