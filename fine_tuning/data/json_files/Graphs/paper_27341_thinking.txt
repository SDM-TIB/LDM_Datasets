To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Knowledge-based Approach for the Automatic Construction of Skill Graphs for Online Monitoring" by Inga Jatzkowski et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the concept of skill graphs but does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine the **related work section** to see if any datasets are referenced in the context of previous research. This section may provide insights into datasets that have been used in similar studies or methodologies.

Then, I will focus on the **approach section**, particularly where the authors describe their methodology for constructing skill graphs. They mention using a knowledge base and ontologies, but I need to check if they reference any specific datasets that were used to validate their approach or for training purposes.

In the **results and discussion sections**, I will look for any mention of datasets used for testing or validating the proposed method. The authors may discuss the performance of their approach on specific datasets, which would be crucial for my extraction.

After identifying any datasets mentioned in the text, I will then refer to the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is essential for proper attribution and to provide context for the datasets used in the research.

If the paper does not explicitly mention any datasets, I will note that as well, indicating that the focus was more on the methodology rather than empirical validation with specific datasets.

Finally, I will compile the information I have gathered, ensuring that I include the full citations for any datasets identified, formatted correctly according to academic standards.

By following this structured approach, I will ensure that I accurately extract and cite any datasets referenced in the paper.
