To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Compiler Pass Orders using Coreset and Normalized Value Prediction" by Youwei Liang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the proposed method is evaluated on a "large collection (4683) of unseen code repositories from diverse domains across 14 datasets." This indicates that multiple datasets are involved.

Next, I will examine **section 3.5 (Dataset Preparation)**, where the authors provide a detailed breakdown of the datasets used in their experiments. They categorize the datasets into two types: **curated** and **uncurated**. 

1. **Curated Datasets**: These are small collections of hand-picked programs used solely for evaluation. The paper lists the following curated datasets:
   - **Cbench**: A benchmark suite for evaluating compiler optimizations.
   - **CHStone**: A benchmark program suite for practical C-based high-level synthesis.
   - **MiBench**: A free, commercially representative embedded benchmark suite.
   - **NPB (NAS Parallel Benchmarks)**: A benchmark suite for evaluating parallel applications.

2. **Uncurated Datasets**: These consist of individual compiler IRs from open-source repositories and synthetically generated programs. The paper lists the following uncurated datasets:
   - **Anghabench**: A suite with one million compilable C benchmarks for code-size reduction.
   - **BLAS**: Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms.
   - **GitHub**: Datasets derived from various GitHub repositories.
   - **Linux**: Datasets derived from the Linux kernel.
   - **OpenCV**: A library of programming functions mainly aimed at real-time computer vision.
   - **TensorFlow**: An open-source platform for machine learning.

In **Table 2**, the authors provide a summary of the dataset types and their training splits, which includes the number of training, validation, and test programs for each dataset.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately documented the datasets along with their full citations as required.
