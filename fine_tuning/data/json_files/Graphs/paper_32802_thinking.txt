To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning State-Augmented Policies for Information Routing in Communication Networks" by Sourajit Das, Navid NaderiAlizadeh, and Alejandro Ribeiro, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of the proposed method on real-time network topologies, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **introduction**. The authors reference various works and methodologies but do not explicitly name datasets here. I will then check the **experiments section** for any detailed descriptions of datasets used for validation.

In the **experiments section**, the authors describe generating random geometric network graphs of size N = |V| using the k-Nearest Neighbor method. They mention that they consider various network topologies from the Internet Topology Zoo dataset. This indicates that the datasets used for their experiments include:

1. **Random Geometric Network Graphs**: These are generated for the experiments, but specific citations are not provided since they are synthetic datasets created for the study.

2. **Internet Topology Zoo Dataset**: This dataset is explicitly mentioned as a source for real-world network topologies used in their experiments.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citation for the Internet Topology Zoo dataset. The relevant citation is:

- For the **Internet Topology Zoo**:
  > Knight, S., Nguyen, H. X., Falkner, N., Bowden, R., & Roughan, M. (2011). The internet topology zoo. *IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications*, 29(9), 1765â€“1775.

Since the random geometric network graphs are not sourced from a specific publication, they do not require a citation.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citation for the Internet Topology Zoo dataset, while noting that the random geometric network graphs are generated for the study.

This structured approach ensures that I accurately capture the datasets used in the research paper while providing proper citations where applicable.
