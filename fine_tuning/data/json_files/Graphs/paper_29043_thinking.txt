To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Situational Graphs for Robot Navigation in Structured Indoor Environments" by Hriday Bavle et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for validation. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the research, which might include references to datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on experiments or datasets**. In this paper, the authors mention that they validated their S-Graphs on datasets generated using both simulated and real-world indoor scenarios. This indicates that there are datasets involved, and I need to find their specific names and details.

In the **experimental validation section**, the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. They mention two types of datasets:
1. **Simulated Datasets**: These include environments created using the Gazebo physics simulator. The specific simulated environments mentioned are:
   - **Construction Floor-1 (CF-1)**: A simulated environment based on architectural plans.
   - **Construction Floor-2 (CF-2)**: Another simulated environment based on different architectural plans.
   - **Simulated Environment-1 (SE-1)**: A simulated environment with six rooms and two narrow corridors.
   - **Simulated Environment-2 (SE-2)**: A simulated environment with four larger rooms and three corridors.

2. **Real-World Datasets**: The authors conducted experiments in various structured indoor environments, including:
   - **LC-1**: An office environment with a long corridor.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets that are based on existing works or frameworks. However, in this case, the datasets mentioned are primarily generated by the authors themselves, so there may not be external citations for them.

Next, I will compile the information about each dataset, ensuring to include the names and descriptions as well as any relevant citations if applicable. Since the datasets are primarily created for this research, I will note that they are original datasets developed by the authors.

Finally, I will summarize the findings in a clear format, ensuring that each dataset is well-documented with its name, description, and any relevant citations, even if they are not traditional references.

After completing this process, I will have a comprehensive list of datasets extracted from the paper, ready for further processing or review.
