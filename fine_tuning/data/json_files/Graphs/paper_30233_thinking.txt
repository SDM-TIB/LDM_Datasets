To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Jointly Contrastive Representation Learning on Road Network and Trajectory" by Zhenyu Mao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors conducted experiments based on **two real-world datasets**. This indicates that datasets are indeed present in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors provide a summary of the datasets used. They mention two datasets released by the GAIA project, which contain car-hailing trip data from two cities, Xi’an and Chengdu, China. The details provided in this section will help me understand the datasets better.

In **subsection 5.1 (Datasets and Preprocessing)**, the authors summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **Xi’an Dataset**: This dataset includes GPS records for car-hailing trips in Xi’an, with a total of 6,161 road segments and 15,779 edges. The average trajectory length is 31.11 meters, and the average number of road segments per trip is 5,880.

2. **Chengdu Dataset**: Similar to the Xi’an dataset, this dataset contains GPS records for car-hailing trips in Chengdu, with 6,632 road segments and 17,038 edges. The average trajectory length is 30.87 meters, and the average number of road segments per trip is 5,732.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets. However, the datasets are not attributed to specific papers in the references, as they are part of the GAIA project data released by Didi company. Therefore, I will cite them as follows:

- **Xi’an Dataset**: Didi Company. *Car-hailing trip data from Xi’an, China*. GAIA Project. Available at: https://outreach.didichuxing.com/appEn-vue/dataList.

- **Chengdu Dataset**: Didi Company. *Car-hailing trip data from Chengdu, China*. GAIA Project. Available at: https://outreach.didichuxing.com/appEn-vue/dataList.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and citations. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the necessary details for each dataset mentioned in the paper.
