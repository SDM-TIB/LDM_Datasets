To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ContrastMotion: Self-supervised Scene Motion Learning for Large-Scale LiDAR Point Clouds" by Xiangze Jia et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the proposed method is validated on the **KITTI Scene Flow dataset** and the **nuScenes dataset**, indicating that these are the primary datasets used in the research.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **Datasets** section or any mention of datasets in the **experiments** section. In the **experiments section**, the authors provide details about the datasets used:

1. **KITTI Scene Flow Dataset**: The paper references this dataset as consisting of 200 training scenes and 200 test scenes, with point clouds and ground truth scene flows obtained from annotated disparity maps and optical flows.

2. **nuScenes Dataset**: This dataset is described as a large-scale public dataset for autonomous driving, collected from 1000 real scenes, with point clouds captured at a frequency of 20Hz and annotated with accurate 3D bounding boxes for 23 object classes.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **KITTI Scene Flow Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Moritz Menze, Christian Heipke, and Andreas Geiger. *Joint 3D Estimation of Vehicles and Scene Flow*. In ISPRS Annals of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences, 2:427, 2015.

- For the **nuScenes Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Holger Caesar, Varun Bankiti, Alex H. Lang, Sourabh Vora, Venice Erin Liong, Qiang Xu, Anush Krishnan, Yu Pan, Giancarlo Baldan, and Oscar Beijbom. *nuscenes: A multimodal dataset for autonomous driving*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1903.11027, 2019.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets, ensuring to include their names, descriptions, and full citations. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
