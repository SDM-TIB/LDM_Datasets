To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Trustworthy Multimodal Regression with Mixture of Normal-inverse Gamma Distributions" by Huan Ma et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on various multimodal regression tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved. I will look for specific mentions of datasets or references to data sources.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (section 4) in detail. This section typically contains the most explicit information about the datasets used in the study. I will look for any subsections that specifically mention datasets, such as "Datasets" or "Data Sources." 

In the experiments section, the authors describe their experiments on three different tasks: 

1. **Superconductivity Dataset**: This dataset contains 21,263 samples, with features from two modalities: experimental properties and chemical formulas. The goal is to predict the critical temperature.

2. **CT Slices Dataset**: This dataset consists of 53,500 CT images from 74 patients, with two modalities describing bone structures and air inclusions. The task is to predict the relative location of the image on the axial axis.

3. **CMU-MOSI and CMU-MOSEI Datasets**: These datasets are used for multimodal sentiment analysis. CMU-MOSI consists of 2,199 short monologue video clips, while CMU-MOSEI contains 23,454 movie review video clips.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **Superconductivity Dataset**:
  > K. Hamidieh. *A data-driven statistical model for predicting the critical temperature of a superconductor*. Computational Materials Science, 154:346â€“354, 2018.

- For the **CT Slices Dataset**:
  > The dataset is referenced as "CT slices" in the paper, but no specific citation is provided. I will note this as a limitation.

- For the **CMU-MOSI Dataset**:
  > Amir Zadeh, Rowan Zellers, Eli Pincus, and Louis-Philippe Morency. *MOSI: multimodal corpus of sentiment intensity and subjectivity analysis in online opinion videos*. CoRR, 2016.

- For the **CMU-MOSEI Dataset**:
  > P. P. Liang, Z. Liu, A. Zadeh, and L. P. Morency. *Multimodal language analysis with recurrent multistage fusion*. In Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, 2018.

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, I will compile this into a structured format for further processing or review.
