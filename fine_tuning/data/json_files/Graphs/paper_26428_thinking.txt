To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Graph Universal Adversarial Attacks: A Few Bad Actors Ruin Graph Learning Models" by Xiao Zang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract discusses the vulnerability of graph neural networks (GNNs) and mentions empirical investigations, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets and Settings)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention three commonly used node classification benchmark datasets:

1. **Cora**: This dataset contains 2,708 nodes, 5,278 edges, and 7 classes, with a train/test split of 140/1000. The accuracy achieved using the GCN model on this dataset is reported as 81.4%.

2. **Citeseer**: This dataset consists of 3,327 nodes, 4,676 edges, and 6 classes, with a train/test split of 120/1000. The accuracy for the GCN model is noted as 70.4%.

3. **Pol.Blogs**: This dataset has 1,222 nodes, 16,714 edges, and 2 classes, with a train/test split of 121/1101. The GCN model achieves an accuracy of 94.3% on this dataset.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. However, since these datasets are commonly used benchmarks in the field, they may not have specific citations in the references. Instead, I will provide general citations based on their common usage in the literature:

- For **Cora**, the citation is:
  > Sen, P., Namata, G., Bilgic, M., Getoor, L., Galligher, J., & Eliassi-Rad, T. (2008). Collective classification in network data. *AI Magazine*, 29(3), 93-93.

- For **Citeseer**, the citation is typically included in the same reference as Cora, as they are both part of the same benchmark suite.

- For **Pol.Blogs**, this dataset is often referenced in the context of social network analysis, but it may not have a specific citation. A general reference could be:
  > Conover, M., Ratkiewicz, J., Francisco, M., GoncÂ¸alves, B., Menczer, F., & Flammini, A. (2011). Political polarization on Twitter. In *Fifth International AAAI Conference on Weblogs and Social Media*.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described with its respective citation, ready for structured output or further processing.
