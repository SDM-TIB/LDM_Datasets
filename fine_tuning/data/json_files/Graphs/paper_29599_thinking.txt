To extract datasets from the research paper titled "FBNetGen: Task-aware GNN-based fMRI Analysis via Functional Brain Network Generation" by Xuan Kan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors conducted experiments on two datasets: the **Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD)** dataset and the **Philadelphia Neuroimaging Cohort (PNC)** dataset. This indicates that these datasets are central to the research.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for further details about these datasets. The introduction provides context about the importance of fMRI data and mentions the use of these datasets for clinical predictions, reinforcing their significance in the study.

I will then look into the **experiments section** (specifically section 3) where the authors describe the datasets in detail. Here, they provide specific information about each dataset:

1. **Philadelphia Neuroimaging Cohort (PNC)**: This dataset includes individuals aged 8–21 years, with a total of 503 subjects, of which 289 are female. The authors mention that the region definition is based on a 264-node atlas.

2. **Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD)**: This dataset is noted as one of the largest publicly available fMRI datasets, including 7901 children, with 3961 being female. The region definition is based on the HCP 360 ROI atlas.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **Philadelphia Neuroimaging Cohort (PNC)**, the citation is:
  > Theodore D. Satterthwaite, Mark A. Elliott, Kosha Ruparel, James Loughead, Karthik Prabhakaran, Monica E. Calkins, Ryan Hopson, Chad Jackson, Jack Keefe, Marisa Riley, Frank D. Mentch, Patrick Sleiman, Ragini Verma, Christos Davatzikos, Hakon Hakonarson, Ruben C. Gur, and Raquel E. Gur. *Neuroimaging of the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort*. NeuroImage, 86:544–553, 2014.

- For the **Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD)** dataset, the citation is:
  > B.J. Casey, Tariq Cannonier, and May I. Conley et al. *The adolescent brain cognitive development (abcd) study: Imaging acquisition across 21 sites*. Developmental Cognitive Neuroscience, 32:43–54, 2018.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will prepare to format this information according to the required structure for downstream processing. This includes ensuring that each dataset is clearly described with its citation included.
