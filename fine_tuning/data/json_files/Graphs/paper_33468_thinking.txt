To extract datasets from the research paper titled "QGFace: Quality-Guided Joint Training For Mixed-Quality Face Recognition" by Youzhe Song and Feng Wang, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on various datasets, which indicates that there are datasets to be identified.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of face recognition across different image qualities and hint at the datasets used for their experiments. This section will likely provide context on the datasets' relevance.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically **section IV (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for training and evaluation. Here, they mention:

1. **VGGFace2**: This dataset is used for training the model. It is a large-scale dataset for face recognition.
2. **LFW (Labeled Faces in the Wild)**: This dataset is widely used for evaluating face recognition algorithms in unconstrained environments.
3. **AgeDB**: A dataset specifically designed for age-related face recognition tasks.
4. **CFP-FP (Celebrities in Frontal-Profile)**: This dataset is used for evaluating face recognition across different poses.
5. **CPLFW (Cross-Pose LFW)**: A dataset for studying cross-pose face recognition.
6. **CALFW (Cross-Age LFW)**: A dataset for studying cross-age face recognition.
7. **SCface**: A low-quality dataset used for cross-resolution face recognition.
8. **Tinyface**: Another low-quality dataset used for face recognition.
9. **IJB-B**: A mixed-quality dataset containing images and video frames for face recognition tasks.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and will include the authors, title, conference or journal name, and publication year.

The citations I will extract are:

- **VGGFace2**:

With these citations, I will ensure that each dataset is accurately represented and attributed in the final output. This structured approach will help me compile a comprehensive list of datasets used in the research paper along with their proper citations.
