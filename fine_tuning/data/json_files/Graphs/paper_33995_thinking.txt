To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Game and Reference: Policy Combination Synthesis for Epidemic Prevention and Control" by Zhiyi Tan and Bingkun Bao, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted extensive experiments on real-world data related to COVID-19, which suggests that there are datasets involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (specifically section 4.1) where the authors describe the data preparation. They mention using real-world COVID-19 epidemic data from the US, which is crucial for understanding the datasets utilized in their experiments.

In section 4.1, the authors provide specific details about the dataset:
- **COVID-19 epidemic data**: This dataset includes information from all 50 states in the US, covering the period from January 1, 2020, to October 31, 2022. It consists of epidemic data, policies, and GDP records.

I will also check the **References section** to find any citations related to the datasets used. However, in this case, the authors do not provide specific citations for the COVID-19 data, as it is derived from official statistical data from the CDC.

Since the dataset is based on publicly available data from the CDC, I will note that the citation for the dataset can be referenced as follows:
- **COVID-19 Data**: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). *COVID Data Tracker*. Available at: https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker.

Now, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format, ensuring to include the full citation for the dataset as required.

After completing this process, I will have a clear and concise entry for the dataset used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
