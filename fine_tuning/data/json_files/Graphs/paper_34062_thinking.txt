To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Temporal-Spatial Object Relations Modeling for Vision-and-Language Navigation" by Bowen Huang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. In the abstract, the authors mention that their experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of their method on the **REVERIE**, **SOON**, and **R2R** datasets. This indicates that these datasets are central to their research.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (Section IV) where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used. Here, they explicitly mention:

1. **REVERIE Dataset**: This dataset consists of instructions that describe target locations and objects of interest, with an average of 21 words per instruction. It provides bounding boxes for each object in various panoramas, and the paths demonstrated by experts vary in length from 4 to 7 steps.

2. **SOON Dataset**: This dataset offers detailed instructions that accurately identify target rooms and objects, averaging 47 words in length. Unlike REVERIE, it does not include predefined bounding boxes, requiring the agent to predict objects' central locations within the panoramas.

3. **R2R Dataset**: This dataset contains a total of 21,567 words, with an average instruction length of 29 words. It lacks object annotations, so the authors substitute object features with features from panoramic images.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

- For the **REVERIE dataset**, the citation is:
  > Qi, Y., Wu, Q., Anderson, P., Wang, X., Wang, Y., Shen, C., & van den Hengel, A. (2020). *Reverie: Remote embodied visual referring expression in real indoor environments*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pp. 9979–9988.

- For the **SOON dataset**, the citation is:
  > Zhu, F., Liang, X., Zhu, Y., Yu, Q., Chang, X., & Liang, X. (2021). *SOON: Scenario oriented object navigation with graph-based exploration*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pp. 12 684–12 694.

- For the **R2R dataset**, the citation is:
  > Anderson, P., Wu, Q., Teney, D., Bruce, J., Johnson, M., Sunderhauf, N., Reid, I., Gould, S., & van den Hengel, A. (2018). *Vision-and-language navigation: Interpreting visually-grounded navigation instructions in real environments*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pp. 3674–3683.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this into a structured format for further processing or review.
