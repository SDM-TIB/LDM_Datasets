To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Classifier-Free Incremental Learning Framework for Scalable Medical Image Segmentation" by Xiaoyang Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on a "multi-modal, multi-source dataset for medical image segmentation," which suggests that multiple datasets are involved.

Next, I will examine **section 4 (Experiments and Results)**, particularly the **subsection 4.1 (Datasets and Preprocessing)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention a curated dataset of 3,035 volumetric images from various sources, which is a strong indication that specific datasets will be listed.

In this subsection, the authors explicitly list the datasets used:
1. **AbdomenCT-1K**: This dataset is referenced with a citation that I will need to extract.
2. **AMOS**: This dataset is divided into two subsets, AMOS-CT and AMOS-MRI, and I will need to note both.
3. **BTCV**: Another dataset mentioned, which will require citation.
4. **FLARE22**: This dataset is also included and will need citation.
5. **NIH-Pancreas**: This dataset is mentioned and will require citation.
6. **TotalSegmentator**: This dataset is included and will need citation.
7. **Urogram**: This dataset is mentioned and will require citation.
8. **WORD**: This dataset is included and will need citation.
9. **LifespanBTS**: This dataset is mentioned and will require citation.

After identifying these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets.

The citations I will extract are as follows:
- For **AbdomenCT-1K**, the citation is:

Springer, 2015.

- For **TotalSegmentator**, the citation is:

- For **Urogram**, the citation is:
  > The Urogram dataset comprises 122 contrast-enhanced CT images from patients undergoing urinary system examinations. (Citation details are not provided in the text, so I will note that I need to find the original source.)

- For **WORD**, the citation is:
  > Xiangde Luo, Wenjun Liao, Jianghong Xiao, Jieneng Chen, Tao Song, Xiaofan Zhang, Kang Li, Dimitris N Metaxas, Guotai Wang, and Shaoting Zhang. *WORD: A large scale dataset, benchmark and clinical applicable study for abdominal organ segmentation from ct image.* arXiv preprint arXiv:2111.02403, 2021.

- For **LifespanBTS**, the citation is:

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
