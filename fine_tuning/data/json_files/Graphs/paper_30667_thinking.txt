To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Curved Contrastive Learning for Abstract Sequence Modeling Utilized on Long Short-Term Dialogue Planning" by Stefan Schaffer et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the use of the **DailyDialog dataset** for evaluating the planning capability in conversations, which indicates that this dataset is significant for the research.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. In section 7 (Experiments), the authors explicitly state that they conducted experiments on two dialogue corpora: **DailyDialog** and the **Microsoft Dialogue Challenge (MDC)**. This confirms that both datasets are utilized in their experiments.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. **DailyDialog Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Yanran Li, Hui Su, Xiaoyu Shen, Wenjie Li, Ziqiang Cao, and Shuzi Niu. *DailyDialog: A manually labelled multi-turn dialogue dataset*. In Proceedings of the Eighth International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing (Volume 1: Long Papers), pages 986â€“995, Taipei, Taiwan, 2017.

2. **Microsoft Dialogue Challenge (MDC)**: The citation is:
   > Xiujun Li, Yu Wang, Siqi Sun, Sarah Panda, Jingjing Liu, and Jianfeng Gao. *Microsoft dialogue challenge: Building end-to-end task-completion dialogue systems*. 2018.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will summarize the findings:

- **DailyDialog**: A dataset used for evaluating dialogue planning capabilities, with a citation provided.
- **Microsoft Dialogue Challenge (MDC)**: Another dataset used for experiments, with its citation also noted.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
