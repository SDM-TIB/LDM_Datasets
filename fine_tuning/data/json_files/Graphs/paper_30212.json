The dataset and selection process is similar to the ones described in the reference, which is also used in another reference. The interactions were simulated with GENIE, and simulations of the propagation of secondaries, particle showers, and the propagation of Cherenkov light are the same as used in the reference. The event selection aims to provide a clean neutrino sample in the DeepCore region of IceCube by removing pure noise events, atmospheric muon events and by applying containment cuts.",
