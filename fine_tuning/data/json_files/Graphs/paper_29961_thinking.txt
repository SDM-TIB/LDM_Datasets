To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Correspondence Matters for Video Referring Expression Comprehension" by Meng Cao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors conducted experiments on both video and image REC benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will look into **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, I will find the following datasets:

1. **VID-Sentence Dataset**: This dataset is mentioned as being re-labeled based on the ImageNet video object detection dataset and includes 7,654 trimmed videos with annotated language captions. The authors provide specific details about the vocabulary size and the number of instance pairs used for training and testing.

2. **Lingual OTB99 (LiOTB) Dataset**: This dataset is built on the OTB100 object tracking dataset and contains 100 videos. The authors specify how they split the dataset into training and testing instances.

3. **RefCOCO Dataset**: This dataset consists of 142,210 referring expressions for 50,000 objects in 19,994 images, with details about the average length of expressions and how the dataset is split into different sets.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **VID-Sentence Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Chen, Z., Ma, L., Luo, W., & Wong, K.-Y. K. (2019). Weakly-supervised spatio-temporally grounding natural sentence in video. *arXiv preprint arXiv:1906.02549*.

- For the **Lingual OTB99 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Li, Z., Tao, R., Gavves, E., Snoek, C. G. M., & Smeulders, A. W. M. (2017). Tracking by natural language specification. In *Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition* (pp. 6495–6503).

- For the **RefCOCO Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yu, L., Poirson, P., Yang, S., Berg, A. C., & Berg, T. L. (2016). Modeling context in referring expressions. In *European Conference on Computer Vision* (pp. 69–85).

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations.
