To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Bottleneck Analysis of Dynamic Graph Neural Network Inference on CPU and GPU" by Hanqiu Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions profiling eight prevailing dynamic graph neural networks (DGNNs) and provides a brief overview of the analysis conducted. However, it does not explicitly mention any datasets. I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine **section 1 (Introduction)** for any references to datasets. This section discusses the challenges and motivations behind the research but does not provide specific dataset names. 

I will then move on to **section 2 (Motivations)** and **section 3 (Background)**, where the authors describe the models analyzed. Here, I will look for any mention of datasets used for training or evaluation of the DGNNs. 

In **section 3.8 (LDG)**, the authors mention that the model is similar to DyRep and is used for modeling social networks and tracking disease spread. However, they do not provide specific datasets.

Next, I will check **section 4 (Experiments and Bottleneck Analysis)**, where the authors discuss the profiling results. They mention various models but do not specify datasets used for these models. 

Finally, I will look at the **References section** to identify any datasets that may have been cited in the context of the models discussed. The authors mention several datasets in the artifact appendix, specifically in **A.3.4 Data sets**. The datasets listed are:

1. **Bitcoin Alpha**: Available at [Stanford SNAP](http://snap.stanford.edu/data/soc-sign-bitcoin-alpha.html).
2. **Reddit Hyperlink Network**: Available at [Stanford SNAP](http://snap.stanford.edu/data/soc-RedditHyperlinks.html).
3. **Stochastic Block Model**: Available at [GitHub EvolveGCN](https://github.com/IBM/EvolveGCN/tree/master/data).
4. **Wikipedia**: Available at [Stanford SNAP](https://snap.stanford.edu/jodie/).
5. **Caltrans Performance Measurement System (PeMS)**: Available at [Caltrans](https://dot.ca.gov/programs/traffic-operations/pems-source).
6. **Social Evolution**: Available at [MIT Reality Commons](http://realitycommons.media.mit.edu/socialevolution4.html).
7. **GitHub-data**: Available at [GH Archive](https://www.gharchive.org/).
8. **LastFM**: Available at [Stanford SNAP](http://snap.stanford.edu/jodie/lastfm.csv).
9. **Molecular Trajectories ISO17 Dataset**: Available at [Quantum Machine](http://quantum-machine.org/datasets).

Now, I will compile the full citations for each dataset based on the information provided in the appendix:

- **Bitcoin Alpha Dataset**: 
  > Stanford SNAP. *Bitcoin Alpha*. Available at: http://snap.stanford.edu/data/soc-sign-bitcoin-alpha.html.

- **Reddit Hyperlink Network**: 
  > Stanford SNAP. *Reddit Hyperlink Network*. Available at: http://snap.stanford.edu/data/soc-RedditHyperlinks.html.

- **Stochastic Block Model**: 
  > IBM. *Stochastic Block Model*. Available at: https://github.com/IBM/EvolveGCN/tree/master/data.

- **Wikipedia Dataset**: 
  > Stanford SNAP. *Wikipedia*. Available at: https://snap.stanford.edu/jodie/.

- **Caltrans Performance Measurement System (PeMS)**: 
  > California Department of Transportation. *Caltrans Performance Measurement System (PeMS)*. Available at: https://dot.ca.gov/programs/traffic-operations/pems-source.

- **Social Evolution Dataset**: 
  > MIT Reality Commons. *Social Evolution*. Available at: http://realitycommons.media.mit.edu/socialevolution4.html.

- **GitHub-data**: 
  > GH Archive. *GitHub-data*. Available at: https://www.gharchive.org/.

- **LastFM Dataset**: 
  > Stanford SNAP. *LastFM*. Available at: http://snap.stanford.edu/jodie/lastfm.csv.

- **Molecular Trajectories ISO17 Dataset**: 
  > Quantum Machine. *Molecular Trajectories ISO17 Dataset*. Available at: http://quantum-machine.org/datasets.

After gathering all this information, I will ensure that each dataset is accurately represented in the final output, ready for further processing or review.
