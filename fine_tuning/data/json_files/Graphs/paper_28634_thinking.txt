To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ExCon: Explanation-driven Supervised Contrastive Learning for Image Classification" by Zhibo Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on **CIFAR-100** and **Tiny ImageNet** datasets, indicating that these are the datasets used for their evaluations.

Next, I will check the **experiments section** for more details about these datasets. In section 4.1, the authors explicitly state that they used **CIFAR-100** and **Tiny ImageNet** for their experiments. They provide some context about the training settings for each dataset, which confirms their usage in the study.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **CIFAR-100**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton, et al. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. 2009.

- For **Tiny ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Patryk Chrabaszcz, Ilya Loshchilov, and Frank Hutter. *A downsampled variant of imagenet as an alternative to the cifar datasets*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1707.08819, 2017.

Having gathered the necessary information, I will now compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research.
