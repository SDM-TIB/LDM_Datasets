To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Part-aware Prototype Network for Few-shot Semantic Segmentation" by Yongfei Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experimental evaluations on two benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors discuss the challenges of few-shot semantic segmentation and mention the datasets used for evaluation. They specifically refer to two datasets: **PASCAL-5i** and **COCO-20i**. I will note these names as potential datasets to extract.

I will then look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this case, the authors explicitly state that they evaluated their method on the **PASCAL-5i** and **COCO-20i** datasets. This confirms that these are the datasets used for their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **PASCAL-5i dataset**, the citation is:
   > Shaban, A., Bansal, S., and Boots, B. "One-Shot Learning for Semantic Segmentation." In Proceedings of the British Machine Vision Conference (BMVC), 2017.

2. For the **COCO-20i dataset**, the citation is:
   > Wang, K., Liew, J.H., Zou, Y., Zhou, D., and Feng, J. "PANet: Few-shot Image Semantic Segmentation with Prototype Alignment." arXiv preprint arXiv:1906.01234, 2019.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets:

- **PASCAL-5i**: A dataset created from the PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset, specifically designed for few-shot semantic segmentation tasks.
- **COCO-20i**: A dataset derived from the MS COCO dataset, also tailored for few-shot semantic segmentation challenges.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all information is accurately represented for further use or analysis.
