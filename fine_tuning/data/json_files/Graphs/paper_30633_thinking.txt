To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Semi-Equivariant Continuous Normalizing Flows for Target-Aware Molecule Generation" by Eyal Rozenberg and Daniel Freedman, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors evaluate their method on the **CrossDocked2020 dataset**, which is a strong indication that this dataset is central to their research.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments** section. In the provided text, the authors explicitly mention the **CrossDocked2020 dataset** in the introduction and later provide a detailed description in the **data** section. They describe it as the first large-scale standardized dataset for training machine learning models with ligand poses cross-docked against non-cognate receptor structures, containing 22.5 million poses.

Now, I will gather the necessary details about the dataset. The paper mentions that the dataset is organized by clustering similar binding pockets across the Protein Data Bank (PDB) and includes information such as root mean squared deviation (RMSD) and Vina cross-docking scores.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the **CrossDocked2020 dataset**. The citation provided in the text is:
> Francoeur, P., Masuda, T., Sunseri, J., Jia, A., Iovanisci, R. B., Snyder, I., & Koes, D. R. (2020). Three-dimensional convolutional neural networks and a cross-docked data set for structure-based drug design. *Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling*, 60(9), 4200â€“4215.

With this information, I can summarize the dataset extraction process:

1. **Identify the dataset**: The **CrossDocked2020 dataset** is mentioned in the abstract and introduction.
2. **Gather details**: The dataset contains 22.5 million poses of ligands docked into multiple similar binding pockets across the PDB.
3. **Find the citation**: The full citation for the dataset is retrieved from the references.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use, ensuring that the full citation is included for the dataset extracted from the paper.
