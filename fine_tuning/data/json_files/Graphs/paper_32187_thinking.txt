To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Histopathology Image Classification using Deep Manifold Contrastive Learning" by Jing Wei Tan and Won-Ki Jeong, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the method was evaluated on two real-world histopathology image datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Results)**, where the authors discuss the datasets used for their experiments. They mention two tasks: intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas (IHCCs) subtype classification and liver cancer type classification. The details provided in this section will help me identify the datasets used for these tasks.

1. **IHCCs Dataset**: The authors describe this dataset as being collected from 168 patients with 332 whole slide images (WSIs). They specify that the WSIs were categorized based on gene mutation information, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's context.

2. **Liver Cancer Dataset**: This dataset consists of 323 WSIs, which can be classified into hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) and IHCCs. The authors mention that 121 WSIs were used for training, while the rest were used for testing.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. However, in this case, the datasets are described based on the authors' own collection and do not have external citations. The only reference to an external dataset is the Pathology AI Platform, which is mentioned in the context of the liver cancer dataset.

The citation for the Pathology AI Platform is:
> Pathology AI platform (PAIP). http://wisepaip.org/paip

Since the other datasets are not formally published datasets with citations, I will note them as internal datasets used by the authors.

Finally, I will summarize the datasets extracted from the paper, ensuring to include the relevant details and citations where applicable. The entries will be structured clearly to reflect the information gathered from the paper.
