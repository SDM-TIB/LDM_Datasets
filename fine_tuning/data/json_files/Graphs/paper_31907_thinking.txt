To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Lexical-aware Non-autoregressive Transformer-based ASR Model" by Chong-En Lin and Kuan-Yu Chen, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that experiments were conducted on three datasets: **AISHELL-1**, **CSJ**, and **TEDLIUM 2**. This is a good starting point as it explicitly lists the datasets used in the research.

Next, I will look into **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors provide more details about the datasets. In this section, they confirm the use of the same three datasets mentioned earlier. I will take note of any specific details provided about each dataset, such as their characteristics or the context in which they were used.

Now, I will gather the necessary citations for each dataset from the **References section** of the paper. This is crucial for providing proper attribution. 

1. **AISHELL-1**: The citation is:
   > H. Bu, J. Du, X. Na, B. Wu, and H. Zheng. *AISHELL-1: An open-source Mandarin speech corpus and a speech recognition baseline*. In 2017 20th conference of the oriental chapter of the international coordinating committee on speech databases and speech I/O systems and assessment (O-COCOSDA), pages 1–5, 2017.

2. **CSJ**: The citation is:
   > K. Maekawa. *Corpus of spontaneous Japanese: Its design and evaluation*. In ISCA & IEEE Workshop on Spontaneous Speech Processing and Recognition, 2003.

3. **TEDLIUM 2**: The citation is:
   > A. Rousseau, P. Delégilse, Y. Esteve et al. *Enhancing the TEDLIUM corpus with selected data for language modeling and more TED talks*. In LREC, pages 3935–3939, 2014.

After collecting the dataset names and their respective citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset along with its citation. This ensures that all relevant details are captured and properly attributed, making it easier for others to reference these datasets in their own work.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for review or further processing, ensuring that they are clear and complete.
