To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SR-GCL: Session-Based Recommendation with Global Context Enhanced Augmentation in Contrastive Learning" by Eunkyu Oh et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the experiments were conducted on "two real-world E-commerce datasets," which indicates that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention:

1. **Yoochoose**: This dataset was released by the RecSys Challenge 2015 and contains click-stream data from an E-commerce website over a period of six months.

2. **Diginetica**: This dataset was used as a challenge dataset for the CIKM Cup 2016 and consists of transaction data suitable for session-based recommendations.

I will also check the **statistics section** for additional details about these datasets, such as the number of clicks, train/test sessions, number of items, and average session length. This information helps to provide a clearer understanding of the datasets' characteristics.

Now, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. However, since these datasets are commonly known and used in the research community, they may not have formal citations in the references. Instead, I will summarize their origins based on the information provided in the paper:

- For **Yoochoose**, the citation is:
  > RecSys Challenge 2015. *Yoochoose Dataset*. Available at: https://recsys.acm.org/recsys15/challenge/

- For **Diginetica**, the citation is:
  > CIKM Cup 2016. *Diginetica Dataset*. Available at: https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/11161

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
