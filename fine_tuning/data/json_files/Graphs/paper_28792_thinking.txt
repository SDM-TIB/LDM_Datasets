To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Are we really making much progress? Revisiting, benchmarking, and refining heterogeneous graph neural networks" by Qingsong Lv et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract states that the authors constructed the **Heterogeneous Graph Benchmark (HGB)**, which consists of 11 diverse datasets. This indicates that there are multiple datasets to extract.

Next, I will look into **section 4 (Heterogeneous Graph Benchmark)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the datasets included in HGB. This section outlines the datasets used for various tasks, such as node classification, link prediction, and knowledge-aware recommendation.

In **subsection 4.2 (Dataset Construction)**, the authors list the datasets used for different tasks:

1. **Node Classification Datasets**:
   - **DBLP**: A bibliography website of computer science, using a commonly used subset in 4 areas.
   - **IMDB**: A website about movies, using a subset from various movie genres.
   - **ACM**: A citation network, using a subset that preserves all edges.
   - **Freebase**: A knowledge graph sampled to include 8 genres of entities.

2. **Link Prediction Datasets**:
   - **Amazon**: A subset of electronics category products with co-viewing and co-purchasing links.
   - **LastFM**: A subset released by HetRec 2011, filtered for users and tags.
   - **PubMed**: A biomedical literature library subset.

3. **Knowledge-aware Recommendation Datasets**:
   - **Amazon-book**: A subset of Amazon reviews related to books.
   - **LastFM**: A subset extracted from last.fm with timestamps.
   - **Yelp-2018**: A dataset adapted from the 2018 Yelp challenge.
   - **Movielens**: A subset of the Movielens-20M dataset.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The paper provides links to the datasets, which I will use to construct the citations.

For example:
- **DBLP**: The citation can be referenced as:
  > DBLP. "DBLP: Computer Science Bibliography." [http://dblp.uni-trier.de/](http://dblp.uni-trier.de/).

- **IMDB**: The citation can be referenced as:
  > IMDB. "IMDB Movie Database." [https://www.imdb.com/](https://www.imdb.com/).

- **ACM**: The citation can be referenced as:
  > ACM. "ACM Digital Library." [https://dl.acm.org/](https://dl.acm.org/).

- **Freebase**: The citation can be referenced as:
  > Freebase. "Freebase: A Collaboratively Created Graph Database." [https://www.freebase.com/](https://www.freebase.com/).

- **Amazon**: The citation can be referenced as:
  > Amazon. "Amazon Product Dataset." [http://jmcauley.ucsd.edu/data/amazon/](http://jmcauley.ucsd.edu/data/amazon/).

- **LastFM**: The citation can be referenced as:
  > LastFM. "LastFM Dataset." [https://www.last.fm/](https://www.last.fm/).

- **PubMed**: The citation can be referenced as:
  > PubMed. "PubMed: Biomedical Literature." [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/).

- **Yelp**: The citation can be referenced as:
  > Yelp. "Yelp Dataset Challenge." [https://www.yelp.com/dataset](https://www.yelp.com/dataset).

- **Movielens**: The citation can be referenced as:
  > Movielens. "Movielens Dataset." [https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/).

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries along with their full citations to ensure that they are accurately represented and ready for further processing or review.
