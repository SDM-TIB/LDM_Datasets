To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Hyperspectral Super-Resolution via Coupled Tensor Ring Factorization" by Wei He et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of low-resolution hyperspectral images (HSI) and high-resolution multispectral images (MSI) for the hyperspectral super-resolution (HSR) task, indicating that these types of images are likely datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section IV), where the authors describe the datasets used for validation. In this section, they mention three datasets: 

1. **Washington DC Mall (WDC)**: This dataset is used for evaluating the proposed methods. The authors provide details about the size of the HR-HSI, HSI, and MSI images derived from this dataset.

2. **Pavia Center (PaC)**: Another dataset mentioned in the experiments, also used for testing the proposed methods. The authors provide similar details about the image sizes.

3. **Indian Pines**: This dataset is the third one used in the experiments, with the authors again specifying the sizes of the images involved.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations typically include the authors, title, publication venue, and year of publication. 

For the datasets mentioned, I will look for the following citations:

- For **Washington DC Mall (WDC)**, the citation is:
  > B. A. Biehl, "Washington DC Mall Hyperspectral Dataset," Purdue University, 2016. Available: https://engineering.purdue.edu/∼biehl/MultiSpec/hyperspectral

- For **Pavia Center (PaC)**, the citation is:
  > "Pavia Center Hyperspectral Dataset," University of Pavia, 2012. Available: http://www.ehu.eus/ccwintco/index.php/

- For **Indian Pines**, the citation is:
  > "Indian Pines Hyperspectral Dataset," Purdue University, 2016. Available: https://engineering.purdue.edu/∼biehl/MultiSpec/

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets, including their descriptions and full citations, ensuring that I maintain clarity and accuracy in the details provided. This will allow for a comprehensive understanding of the datasets used in the research paper.
