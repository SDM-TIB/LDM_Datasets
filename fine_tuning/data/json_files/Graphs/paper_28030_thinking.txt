To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Boosting Few-Shot Classification with View-Learnable Contrastive Learning" by Xu Luo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions "extensive experiments on standard few-shot learning benchmarks," which suggests that specific datasets are used. I will look for any dataset names mentioned directly in these sections.

Next, I will proceed to the **experimental results section** (section 4), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention evaluating their method on two benchmarks: **miniImageNet** and **CUB-200-2011**. I will take note of these datasets and look for additional details about them.

In the **experimental setup** subsection (4.1), the authors provide further context about the datasets. They describe **miniImageNet** as being selected from the well-known ImageNet dataset and **CUB-200-2011** as originally proposed for fine-grained bird classification. This confirms their relevance to the experiments conducted.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and understanding of the datasets' origins:

1. For **miniImageNet**, the citation is:
   > O. Vinyals, C. Blundell, T. Lillicrap, K. Kavukcuoglu, and D. Wierstra. "Matching networks for one shot learning." In NeurIPS, 2016, pp. 3630–3638.

2. For **CUB-200-2011**, the citation is:
   > P. Welinder, S. Branson, T. Mita, C. Wah, F. Schroff, S. Belongie, and P. Perona. "Caltech-UCSD Birds 200." Technical Report CNS-TR-2010-001, California Institute of Technology, 2010.

Additionally, the authors mention evaluating their method on three fine-grained datasets: **Cars**, **Places**, and **Plantae** in the appendix. I will also look for their citations:

3. For **Cars**, the citation is:
   > J. Krause, M. Stark, J. Deng, and L. Fei-Fei. "3D object representations for fine-grained categorization." In ICCV, 2013, pp. 554–561.

4. For **Places**, the citation is:
   > B. Zhou, A. Lapedriza, A. Khosla, A. Oliva, and A. Torralba. "Places: A 10 million image database for scene recognition." IEEE Trans. Pattern Anal. Mach. Intell., vol. 40, no. 6, pp. 1452–1464, 2018.

5. For **Plantae**, the citation is:
   > G. V. Horn, O. M. Aodha, Y. Song, Y. Cui, C. Sun, A. Shepard, H. Adam, P. Perona, and S. J. Belongie. "The iNaturalist species classification and detection dataset." In CVPR, 2018, pp. 8769–8778.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
