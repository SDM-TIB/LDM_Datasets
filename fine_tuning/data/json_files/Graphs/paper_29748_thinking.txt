To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On the Surprising Behaviour of Node2Vec" by Celia Hacker and Bastian Rieck, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and while it may not explicitly mention datasets, it sets the context for what the authors are investigating. The introduction will likely provide more details about the datasets used, especially if they are critical to the experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, where the authors describe their approach to analyzing node2vec. This section often includes information about the datasets used for testing the algorithm. I will look for any specific mentions of datasets, including their names and characteristics.

In the **experiments section**, the authors typically detail the datasets they used for their analyses. Here, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their sizes, types, and any relevant details that describe their structure or purpose in the context of the study.

As I identify datasets, I will also check the **references section** of the paper to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets themselves.

From my reading, I note the following datasets mentioned in the paper:

1. **Les MisÃ©rables Character Co-occurrence Network**: This dataset is used to illustrate the variability in embeddings generated by node2vec. The authors reference the original source of this dataset, which is:
   > Knuth, D. E. (1994). *The Stanford GraphBase - A Platform for Combinatorial Computing*. ACM Press.

2. **Stochastic Block Models (SBMs)**: The authors mention using two specific stochastic block models (sbm2 and sbm3) for their experiments. While these models are generated for the purpose of the study, they are based on established methodologies in graph theory. The reference for the general concept of stochastic block models is:
   > Holland, P. W., Laskey, K. B., & Leinhardt, S. (1983). *Stochastic blockmodels: First steps*. Social Networks, 5(2), 109-137.

After identifying these datasets and their citations, I will compile the information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset, its description, and the full citation. This will ensure that the datasets are accurately represented and easily accessible for future reference or use in related research.
