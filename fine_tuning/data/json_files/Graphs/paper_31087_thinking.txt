To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Layout-aware Webpage Quality Assessment" by Anfeng Cheng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or data sources.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly **section 5 (Offline Evaluation)**, where the authors describe their evaluation process. Here, they mention collecting a set of webpages from their database, which is manually labeled for quality assessment. This indicates that there is a dataset involved, but I need to gather more details.

In **section 5.1 (Dataset)**, the authors specify that they used **600,000 webpages for training** and **20,000 webpages for testing**. They also mention that these webpages were manually labeled on their crowdsourcing platform, which is crucial information for understanding the dataset's context.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. However, since the dataset is derived from their own collection and labeling process, it may not have a formal citation like other datasets. Instead, I will note that the dataset is proprietary to the authors and describe it accordingly.

The dataset can be summarized as follows:
- **Dataset Name**: Webpage Quality Assessment Dataset
- **Description**: A collection of 600,000 webpages for training and 20,000 webpages for testing, manually labeled for quality assessment (0 for low quality, 1 for high quality).
- **Citation**: Not formally cited; dataset is proprietary to the authors.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry in a structured format, ensuring that I include the necessary details and the context of the dataset's usage in the research.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for review or further processing, ensuring that all relevant information is accurately captured and presented.
