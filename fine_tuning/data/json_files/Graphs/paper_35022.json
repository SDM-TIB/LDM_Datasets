The nodes represent unique anonymized accounts, each characterized by 10-dimensional features related to registration days, logging activities, and interaction frequency. The edges in the graph denote transaction records between accounts. Human experts annotate nodes as anomalies if they fall into categories such as fraud, money laundering, or online gambling.",
