To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Counterfactual Cross-modality Reasoning for Weakly Supervised Video Moment Localization" by Zezhong Lv et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the proposed method is evaluated on two benchmark datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.2 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention:

1. **Charades-STA Dataset**: This dataset consists of 16,128 video-query pairs generated from 6,672 videos, with an average video duration of 29.96 seconds. The authors specify that they trained their model on the training set containing 12,408 video-query pairs and evaluated it on the test set with 3,720 video-query pairs.

2. **ActivityNet-Captions Dataset**: This dataset contains 19,209 videos with an average duration of 117.6 seconds. The authors describe how they split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets, which contain 37,417, 17,505, and 17,031 video-query pairs, respectively.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Charades-STA Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Gunnar A Sigurdsson, Gül Varol, Xiaolong Wang, Ali Farhadi, Ivan Laptev, and Abhinav Gupta. *Hollywood in homes: Crowdsourcing data collection for activity understanding*. In European Conference on Computer Vision. Springer, 510–526, 2016.

- For the **ActivityNet-Captions Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Fabian Caba Heilbron, Victor Escorcia, Bernard Ghanem, and Juan Carlos Niebles. *Activitynet: A large-scale video benchmark for human activity understanding*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 961–970, 2015.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
