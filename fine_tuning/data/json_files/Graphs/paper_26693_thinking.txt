To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Generalization of Deep Convolutional Neural Networks - A Case-study on Open-source Chest Radiographs" by Nazanin Mashhaditafreshi et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on three publicly available databases, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **Materials and Methods section**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used. Here, they mention three datasets:

1. **CheXpert**: This dataset comprises 224,316 frontal and lateral chest radiographs from 65,240 patients.
2. **ChestX-ray14**: This dataset contains 112,120 frontal-view X-ray images from 30,805 patients.
3. **MIMIC Chest X-ray JPG (MIMIC-CXR-JPG)**: This dataset consists of 377,110 images from 65,379 patients.

The authors also provide details about how these datasets were split into training, validation, and test sets, which is crucial for understanding their usage in the experiments.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:

- For **CheXpert**, the citation is:
  > Irvin J, Rajpurkar P, Ko M, Yu Y, Ciurea-Ilcus S, Chute C, et al. *CheXpert: a large chest radiograph dataset with uncertainty labels and expert comparison*. CoRR. 2019;abs/1901.07031. Available from: http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.07031.

- For **ChestX-ray14**, the citation is:
  > Wang X, Peng Y, Lu L, Lu Z, Bagheri M, Summers RM. *ChestX-ray8: hospital-scale chest x-ray database and benchmarks on weakly-supervised classification and localization of common thorax diseases*. CoRR. 2017;abs/1705.02315. Available from: http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.02315.

- For **MIMIC-CXR-JPG**, the citation is:
  > Johnson A, Peng Y, Lu Z, Mark R, Berkowitz S, Horng S. *MIMIC-CXR-JPG - chest radiographs with structured labels*. 2019. Available from: https://doi.org/10.13026/8360-t248.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. Each dataset will be described with its name, a brief description, and the full citation.
