To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Delay-Aware Backpressure Routing Using Graph Neural Networks" by Zhongyuan Zhao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly referenced. The abstract discusses a new algorithm for routing in wireless networks but does not mention specific datasets. I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any references to datasets used for validation or experimentation. The introduction primarily discusses the motivation and background of the research without mentioning specific datasets.

Moving on to the **experiments section**, I will look for any details about the simulations or numerical experiments conducted. This section is likely to contain information about the datasets used for testing the proposed algorithms. 

Upon reviewing the experiments, I find that the authors describe the generation of random networks and the parameters used for simulations, but they do not cite any specific datasets. Instead, they mention that the networks are generated based on a 2D point process and that various parameters are uniformly distributed. This indicates that the authors created synthetic datasets for their experiments rather than using pre-existing datasets.

Since no specific datasets are cited in the paper, I will check the **references section** to see if any of the cited works provide datasets that could be relevant. However, the references primarily consist of foundational papers and methodologies related to wireless networks and backpressure routing, rather than datasets.

In conclusion, while the paper discusses the methodology and experiments in detail, it does not provide any specific datasets or full citations for datasets used in the research. Therefore, I will note that no datasets were extracted from this paper.

Now, I will summarize my findings regarding the datasets in a structured format, ensuring to include any relevant citations from the references section, even if they do not directly correspond to datasets used in the experiments.
