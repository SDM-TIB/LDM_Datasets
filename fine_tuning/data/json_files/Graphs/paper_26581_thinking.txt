To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Relevant Region Prediction for Crowd Counting" by Xinya Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may highlight the datasets used for evaluation. 

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of crowd counting and may reference specific datasets that have been used in previous works or that they are using in their experiments. I will look for any mentions of datasets or benchmarks.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly **section 4**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention that they evaluated their method on three crowd counting benchmark datasets. I will look for the specific names of these datasets and any relevant details about them.

From the text, I identify the following datasets:

1. **ShanghaiTech Dataset**: This dataset consists of 1198 annotated images with a total of 330,165 people. It is divided into two parts: Part A includes 482 images in highly congested scenes, while Part B includes 716 images in relatively sparse scenes.

2. **UCF CC 50 Dataset**: This dataset contains 50 images in extremely congested scenes, with counts ranging from 94 to 4543 individuals per image.

3. **UCF-QNRF Dataset**: This dataset consists of 1535 images with 1,251,642 annotations, making it one of the largest datasets for crowd counting.

Now, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

- For the **ShanghaiTech Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yingying Zhang, Desen Zhou, Single-image crowd counting via multi-column convolutional neural network, *CVPR*, 2016, pp. 589–597.

- For the **UCF CC 50 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Idrees, H., Saleemi, I., & Shah, M. (2013). Multi-source multi-scale counting in extremely dense crowd images. *CVPR*, 2013, pp. 2547–2554.

- For the **UCF-QNRF Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Idrees, H., et al. (2018). Composition loss for counting, density map estimation and localization in dense crowds. *ECCV*, 2018.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will help in accurately documenting the datasets used in the research.
