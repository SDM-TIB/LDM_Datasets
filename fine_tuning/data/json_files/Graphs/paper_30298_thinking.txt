To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Explainable Graph Pyramid Autoformer for Long-Term Traffic Forecasting" by Weiheng Zhong et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the development of a model for long-term traffic forecasting, but I need to look for specific datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 5), where the authors mention using two real-world traffic datasets: **PeMS-BAY** and **Metr-LA**. I will extract details about these datasets, including their characteristics and the context in which they were used.

In the experiments section, the authors provide the following information:

1. **PeMS-BAY Dataset**: This dataset includes information from 325 sensors in the San Francisco Bay area, collecting five months of traffic data from January 1 to May 31, 2017.

2. **Metr-LA Dataset**: This dataset consists of information from 207 sensors in the highways of Los Angeles County, with data collected from March 1 to June 30, 2012.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

- For the **PeMS-BAY Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yaguang Li, Rose Yu, Cyrus Shahabi, and Yan Liu. *Diffusion convolutional recurrent neural network: Data-driven traffic forecasting*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1707.01926, 2017.

- For the **Metr-LA Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Bing Yu, Haoteng Yin, and Zhanxing Zhu. *Spatio-temporal graph convolutional networks: A deep learning framework for traffic forecasting*. In Proceedings of the Twenty-Seventh International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence, 2018.

With this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details and that the citations are accurate and complete.
