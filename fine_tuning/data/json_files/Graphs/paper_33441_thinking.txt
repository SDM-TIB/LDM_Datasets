To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Energy-Based Learning Algorithms for Analog Computing: A Comparative Study" by Benjamin Scellier et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors trained deep convolutional Hopfield networks (DCHNs) on five vision tasks: **MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, SVHN, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100**. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for the experiments conducted in the study.

Next, I will verify the details of these datasets in the **experiments section**. The authors explicitly state that they trained their models on the aforementioned datasets, confirming their relevance to the study. 

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset from the **References section** of the paper:

1. **MNIST Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Yann LeCun, Léon Bottou, Yoshua Bengio, and Patrick Haffner. *Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition*. Proceedings of the IEEE, 86(11):2278–2324, 1998.

2. **Fashion-MNIST Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Han Xiao, Kashif Rasul, and Roland Vollgraf. *Fashion-MNIST: A novel image dataset for benchmarking machine learning algorithms*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1708.07747, 2017.

3. **SVHN Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Yuval Netzer, Tao Wang, Adam Coates, Alessandro Bissacco, Bo Wu, and Andrew Y. Ng. *Reading digits in natural images with unsupervised feature learning*. 2011.

4. **CIFAR-10 Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. 2009. URL: https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/learning-features-2009-TR.pdf.

5. **CIFAR-100 Dataset**: The citation is the same as CIFAR-10 since they are from the same source:
   > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. 2009. URL: https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/learning-features-2009-TR.pdf.

After collecting the dataset names and their citations, I will ensure that each dataset is clearly documented, including its purpose and any relevant details mentioned in the paper.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference and potential downstream processing.
