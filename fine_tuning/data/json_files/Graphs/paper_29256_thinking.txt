To extract datasets from the research paper titled "End-to-End Active Speaker Detection" by Juan León Alcázar et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their method on the **AVA-ActiveSpeaker dataset** and also references another dataset called **Talkies**. This indicates that these datasets are likely important for the experiments conducted in the paper.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (section 4) to find detailed descriptions of the datasets used. In section 4.1, the authors explicitly state that they evaluate their method on the **AVA-ActiveSpeaker dataset** and provide a brief description of it. They mention that this dataset contains 262 Hollywood movies, with 120 in the training set, 33 in validation, and the remaining 109 in testing. It also provides bounding boxes for a total of 5.3 million faces.

The authors also discuss the **Talkies dataset** in section 4.2, describing it as a manually labeled dataset for the ASD task, collected from social media videos, containing 23,507 face tracks extracted from 799,446 individual face detections. This dataset is noted for its focus on short clips and includes off-screen speech events.

Now, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For the **AVA-ActiveSpeaker dataset**, the citation is:
> Joseph Roth, Sourish Chaudhuri, Ondrej Klejch, Radhika Marvin, Andrew Gallagher, Liat Kaver, Sharadh Ramaswamy, Arkadiusz Stopczynski, Cordelia Schmid, Zhonghua Xi, et al. *AVA Active Speaker: An Audio-Visual Dataset for Active Speaker Detection*. In ICASSP 2020-2020 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP), pages 4492–4496. IEEE, 2020.

For the **Talkies dataset**, the citation is:
> Juan León-Alcázar, Fabian Caba Heilbron, Ali Thabet, and Bernard Ghanem. *MAAS: Multi-Modal Assignation for Active Speaker Detection*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2101.03682, 2021.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described with its name, description, and full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant details about the datasets used in the research paper.
