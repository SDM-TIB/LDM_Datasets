To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A unifying primary framework for quantum graph neural networks from quantum graph states" by Ammar Daskin, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's focus, but I will need to look deeper into the introduction and methodology for specific dataset mentions.

In the **introduction**, the author discusses various quantum graph neural network models and their applications, but does not explicitly mention any datasets. I will continue to the **methodology** and **experiments sections** to see if any datasets are referenced there.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments** or **results sections**. If the paper includes a section that describes the datasets used for experiments, I will extract the names and details of those datasets.

If the datasets are not explicitly named in the main sections, I will check the **references** section for any papers that might describe datasets used in the context of quantum graph neural networks. This could include datasets used in previous studies that the author builds upon.

Once I identify the datasets, I will ensure to gather the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and for readers who may want to access the datasets themselves.

For example, if I find that the paper references a dataset like the "Quantum Graph Dataset," I will look for the original source or paper that describes this dataset and extract the full citation.

After compiling the dataset names and their citations, I will organize this information clearly, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its corresponding citation.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for any required output format, ensuring that all necessary information is included for future reference or processing.
