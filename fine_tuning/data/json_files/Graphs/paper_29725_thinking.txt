To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On Finite-Sample Identifiability of Contrastive Learning-Based Nonlinear Independent Component Analysis" by Qi Lyu and Xiao Fu, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the datasets used.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. This section typically contains detailed descriptions of the datasets used for validation or testing. I will pay attention to any dataset names, descriptions, and the context in which they are used.

In this paper, the authors mention using synthetic data for experiments, specifically in sections discussing **TCL (Time Contrastive Learning)** and **MVCL (Multiview Contrastive Learning)**. They describe how they generated latent components and the data generation process, which is crucial for understanding the datasets used.

I will also check the **References section** to see if any external datasets are cited. If the authors refer to established datasets, I will extract the full citations for those datasets.

For example, if the paper mentions using the **EEG eye dataset** from the UCI repository, I will note the details provided in the text and then find the full citation in the references.

Once I have identified the datasets, I will compile the information, ensuring to include:

1. The name of the dataset.
2. A brief description of the dataset, including its purpose and any relevant details.
3. The full citation for each dataset, formatted correctly.

Finally, I will organize this information clearly, ready for any further processing or presentation.
