To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Contrastive Learning with Prompt-derived Virtual Semantic Prototypes for Unsupervised Sentence Embedding" by Jiali Zeng et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the effectiveness of the proposed model on various tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved, but I need to find specific names.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors detail their experimental setup. Here, they mention conducting experiments on **seven semantic textual similarity (STS) tasks**, specifically:

1. **STS 2012**: A dataset for evaluating semantic textual similarity.
2. **STS 2013**: Another dataset for the same purpose.
3. **STS 2014**: Continues the trend of evaluating semantic similarity.
4. **STS 2015**: Further extends the evaluation of semantic textual similarity.
5. **STS 2016**: The last in the series of STS datasets.
6. **STS Benchmark**: A widely used benchmark for semantic textual similarity.
7. **SICK-R**: A dataset designed for evaluating compositional distributional semantic models.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide details about the datasets, including their purpose and how they are used in the experiments. This confirms that these datasets are indeed utilized for their evaluations.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries with their full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented and attributed.
