To extract datasets from the research paper titled "BACK TO THE FUTURE: GNN-BASED NO2 FORECASTING VIA FUTURE COVARIATES" by Antonio Giganti et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors are working with air quality forecasting, which suggests that there may be relevant datasets involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of air pollution forecasting and mention various factors that influence pollutant concentrations. However, I need to look for specific datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental setup section**, where the authors describe the dataset used for their experiments. They mention that they conducted experiments on a "recently released real-world dataset" that includes hourly-sampled air quality, meteorological, and traffic data from 24 ground monitoring stations in Madrid, Spain, from January to June 2019. This is a clear indication of the dataset being utilized.

The paper specifies the following details about the dataset:
- **Air quality data**: NO2 concentration [µg/m3]
- **Meteorological data**: wind speed [m/s], wind direction [rad], temperature [°C], relative humidity [%], barometric pressure [mb], solar irradiance [W/m2]
- **Traffic data**: intensity [vehicles/h], occupancy time [%], load (degree of congestion) [%], average traffic speed [km/h]

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the dataset mentioned. The authors refer to a dataset presented in a previous work, which is crucial for proper citation.

The relevant citation for the dataset is:
> Iskandaryan, D., Ramos, F., & Trilles, S. (2023). Graph neural network for air quality prediction: A case study in Madrid. *IEEE Access*, 11, 2729–2742.

With this information, I can summarize the dataset as follows:
1. **Dataset Name**: Madrid Air Quality Dataset
   - **Description**: A dataset composed of hourly-sampled air quality, meteorological, and traffic data from 24 ground monitoring stations in Madrid, Spain, from January to June 2019.
   - **Citation**: Iskandaryan, D., Ramos, F., & Trilles, S. (2023). Graph neural network for air quality prediction: A case study in Madrid. *IEEE Access*, 11, 2729–2742.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format for further processing or review.
