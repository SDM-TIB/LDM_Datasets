To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Semi-Weakly Supervised Object Kinematic Motion Prediction" by Gengxin Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors utilize the **PartNet-Mobility dataset** and the **PartNet dataset**, which suggests that these are key datasets for their research.

Next, I will look for explicit mentions of these datasets in the **introduction**. The authors discuss the challenges of collecting fully annotated datasets for kinematic motion prediction and mention the **PartNet-Mobility** and **Shape2Motion** datasets as existing resources. This confirms their relevance to the study.

In the **methodology section**, the authors describe how they use the **PartNet-Mobility dataset** for training their graph neural network and apply it to the **PartNet dataset** for generating pseudo-labels. This section provides further details on how these datasets are utilized in their experiments.

I will also check the **experiments section** to see if there are any additional datasets mentioned or if the authors provide more context on how the datasets were used in their evaluations. The experiments confirm the use of the **PartNet-Mobility** dataset for training and the **PartNet** dataset for testing.

Finally, I will consult the **References section** to gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper:

1. **PartNet-Mobility Dataset**:

2. **PartNet Dataset**:

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets and their details, ensuring that I include the full citations as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
