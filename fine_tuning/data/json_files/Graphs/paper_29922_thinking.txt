To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Sub 8-Bit Quantization of Streaming Keyword Spotting Models" by Lu Zeng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted large-scale experiments on a significant amount of audio data, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors describe their training and test datasets. They mention using a fully labeled training dataset consisting of **26,000 hours of audio** and two test sets, each containing **4,000 hours of audio**. This section provides a clear overview of the datasets used in their experiments.

The authors specify that the training dataset includes both **far-field audio** and **near-field mobile phone audio**, which is crucial for understanding the context of the datasets. They also mention that the validation test set (VAL) and the independent test set (TEST) contain similar types of audio data.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. However, in this case, the datasets are described in terms of their content (i.e., hours of audio and types of audio) rather than being attributed to specific published datasets. Therefore, I will note that the datasets are derived from de-identified production audio data collected from various sources, but they do not have formal citations like established datasets.

Since the paper does not provide specific citations for the datasets, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **Training Dataset**: 
   - Description: A fully labeled dataset consisting of 26,000 hours of de-identified production audio, including far-field and near-field audio.
   - Citation: Not applicable (derived from internal production data).

2. **Validation Test Set (VAL)**: 
   - Description: A test set consisting of approximately 4,000 hours of audio data, including far-field and near-field audio.
   - Citation: Not applicable (derived from internal production data).

3. **Independent Test Set (TEST)**: 
   - Description: Another test set consisting of approximately 4,000 hours of audio data, collected from a wider range of commodity devices.
   - Citation: Not applicable (derived from internal production data).

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for clarity and future reference. This will ensure that all relevant details are captured, even if formal citations are not available for the datasets used in this research.
