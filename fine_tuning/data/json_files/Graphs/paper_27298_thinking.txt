To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Infant Cry Classification with Graph Convolutional Networks" by Chunyan Ji et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their approach on the **Baby Chillanto Database** and the **Baby2020 Database**. This is a good starting point as it explicitly names the datasets.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** and **experimental results** sections for more details about these datasets. In the introduction, the authors discuss the challenges of limited labeled data in infant cry classification, which sets the context for their dataset choices. 

In **section 4.1 (Datasets and experimental setup)**, the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets:

1. **Baby Chillanto Database**: This dataset is collected by the National Institute of Astrophysics and Optical Electronics, CONACYT, Mexico. It includes 2,267 audio samples of infant cries, categorized into five labels: asphyxia, deaf, hunger, normal, and pain. Each sample is one second long.

2. **Baby2020 Database**: This is a newly developed dataset consisting of 50 hours of recordings from over 100 babies. It includes 5,540 cry samples categorized into three types: hungry, sleepy, and wakeup. The cries are recorded in real environments and labeled by parents or medical professionals.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

- For the **Baby Chillanto Database**, the citation is:
  > O. F. Reyes-Galaviz, S. D. Cano-Ortiz, and C. A. Reyes-GarcÃ­a. *Evolutionary-neural system to classify infant cry units for pathologies identification in recently born babies*. 2008, doi: 10.1109/MICAI.2008.73.

- For the **Baby2020 Database**, since it is a newly developed dataset by the authors, it may not have a formal citation yet. However, I can reference it as follows:
  > Ji, C., Chen, M., Li, B., & Pan, Y. *Baby2020 Database*. Unpublished dataset.

After gathering all this information, I will summarize the datasets in a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its citation. This will facilitate easy access and understanding for anyone reviewing the paper or interested in the datasets used.
