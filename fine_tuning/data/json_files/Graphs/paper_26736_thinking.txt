To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On the Generalizability of Neural Program Models with respect to Semantic-Preserving Program Transformations" by Md Rafiqul Islam Rabin et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors used three Java datasets of different sizes for their experiments, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experimental Setting)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for training their neural program models. Here, they explicitly mention three datasets:

1. **Java-Small**: This dataset contains 9 Java projects for training, 1 for validation, and 1 for testing, totaling about 700K methods. The compressed size is approximately 366MB, and the extracted size is about 1.9GB.

2. **Java-Med**: This dataset consists of 800 Java projects for training, 100 for validation, and 100 for testing, with around 4 million methods. The compressed size is about 1.8GB, and the extracted size is approximately 9.3GB.

3. **Java-Large**: This dataset includes 9000 Java projects for training, 200 for validation, and 300 for testing, containing about 16 million methods. The compressed size is around 7.2GB, and the extracted size is about 37GB.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. However, since these datasets are derived from GitHub projects and not from specific publications, I will note that the authors have not provided formal citations for these datasets. Instead, I will mention that the datasets are publicly available and can be accessed through the authors' provided GitHub link.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format, ensuring to include the dataset names, descriptions, and the acknowledgment of their availability through the authors' GitHub repository.

In summary, the datasets extracted from the paper are:

1. **Java-Small**: 9 Java projects, 700K methods, 366MB compressed, 1.9GB extracted.
2. **Java-Med**: 800 Java projects, 4M methods, 1.8GB compressed, 9.3GB extracted.
3. **Java-Large**: 9000 Java projects, 16M methods, 7.2GB compressed, 37GB extracted.

The datasets can be accessed at the following GitHub repository: https://github.com/mdrafiqulrabin/tnpa-generalizability/.

This structured approach ensures that I have accurately captured the relevant datasets and their details from the research paper.
