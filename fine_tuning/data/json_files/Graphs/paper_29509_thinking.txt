To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CoDo: Contrastive Learning with Downstream Background Invariance for Detection" by Bing Zhao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and method sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on **MSCOCO**, which suggests that this dataset is significant for their research.

Next, I will examine **section 4.1 (Dataset)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. They state that they utilized **ImageNet-1K** for self-supervised pretraining and **MSCOCO** for finetuning to evaluate generalization performance on downstream tasks. Additionally, they mention **PASCAL VOC0712** as part of the background images used during data processing.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset from the **References section** of the paper:

1. **ImageNet-1K**: The citation is:
   > Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, and Li Fei-Fei. *Imagenet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In 2009 IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pages 248–255. IEEE, 2009.

2. **MSCOCO**: The citation is:
   > Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, Serge Belongie, James Hays, Pietro Perona, Deva Ramanan, Piotr Dollar, and C Lawrence Zitnick. *Microsoft coco: Common objects in context*. In European conference on computer vision, pages 740–755. Springer, 2014.

3. **PASCAL VOC0712**: The citation is:
   > M. Everingham, S. M. A. Eslami, L. Van Gool, C. K. I. Williams, J. Winn, and A. Zisserman. *The pascal visual object classes challenge: A retrospective*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 111(1):98–136, Jan. 2015.

After identifying the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
