To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Detecting Irregular Network Activity with Adversarial Learning and Expert Feedback" by Gopikrishna Rathinavel et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions a novel framework for anomaly detection and hints at the use of datasets for evaluation, which is a good starting point.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental setup section** (Section V), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they explicitly mention several datasets:

1. **LTW1**: This dataset consists of long-term wireless emission metadata collected in the 800-900MHz band over two months. It includes 11670 training instances, 5002 validation instances, and 7146 test instances, with specific details about the anomalies present.

2. **LTW2**: Similar to LTW1, this dataset is collected from a second geographical location and spans 10 days. It contains 1645 training instances, 706 validation instances, and 1310 test instances, with a breakdown of benign and anomalous instances.

3. **STW1**: This dataset comprises short-term wireless emission metadata collected from a third location, focusing on high-rate observations. It includes 154 training instances, 39 validation instances, and 198 test instances, with details on the anomalies.

4. **MNIST**: A well-known dataset for machine learning research, consisting of images of handwritten digits. The authors use a specific subset for their experiments, detailing the number of benign and anomalous instances.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

- For **LTW1** and **LTW2**, the paper does not provide a specific citation, but it describes the data collection process and characteristics in detail.
- For **STW1**, similar to LTW1 and LTW2, the dataset is described without a formal citation.
- For **MNIST**, the citation is:
  > LeCun, Y., Cortes, C., & Burges, C. J. C. (1998). *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digit Images for Machine Learning Research*. 

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its citation, if available. This will facilitate easy reference and understanding of the datasets used in the research.
