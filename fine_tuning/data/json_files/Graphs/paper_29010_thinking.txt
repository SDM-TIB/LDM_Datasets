To extract datasets from the research paper titled "High-Dimensional Dynamic Factor Models: A Selective Survey and Lines of Future Research" by Marco Lippi, Manfred Deistler, and Brian Anderson, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's focus on high-dimensional dynamic factor models, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any references to datasets used in the research. The introduction discusses the challenges of analyzing high-dimensional time series but does not specify any datasets.

I will then look into the **methodology and results sections** to see if the authors describe any empirical studies or experiments that utilize specific datasets. In this paper, the authors focus on theoretical aspects and do not present empirical results based on specific datasets.

Since the paper does not mention any datasets explicitly, I will check the **references section** for any cited datasets or related works that may provide datasets relevant to the topic. However, it appears that the paper is more of a theoretical survey rather than an empirical study that utilizes specific datasets.

Given that no datasets are explicitly mentioned or referenced in the paper, I will conclude that there are no datasets to extract from this particular research paper. Therefore, I will not be able to provide full citations for datasets as there are none identified in the text.

In summary, I will document that the paper does not contain any datasets and will note the lack of empirical data references in my findings.
