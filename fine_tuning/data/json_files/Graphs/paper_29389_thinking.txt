To extract datasets from the research paper titled "FedCL: Federated Contrastive Learning for Privacy-Preserving Recommendation" by Chuhan Wu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on four benchmark datasets, which suggests that these datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets and Experimental Settings)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention four datasets:

1. **Beauty**: This dataset is taken from the Amazon dataset dump and includes user interactions in the beauty domain.
2. **Sports**: Another dataset from the Amazon dataset dump, focusing on user interactions in the sports and outdoors domain.
3. **Yelp**: This dataset consists of transaction records from Yelp, specifically using data after January 1st, 2019.
4. **MovieLens 1M (ML-1M)**: A well-known dataset in the recommendation system community, containing 1 million ratings from MovieLens.

I will then gather the specific statistics provided for each dataset, such as the number of users, items, and actions, as these details are important for understanding the context of the datasets.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:

- For the **Amazon datasets** (Beauty and Sports):
  > McAuley, J., & Targett, C., & Shi, Q., & Van Den Hengel, A. (2015). *Image-based recommendations on styles and substitutes*. In Proceedings of the ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval (SIGIR), pages 43–52.

- For the **Yelp dataset**:

- For the **MovieLens 1M dataset**:
  > Harper, F. M., & Konstan, J. A. (2015). *The MovieLens Datasets: History and Context*. ACM Transactions on Interactive Intelligent Systems (TIIS), 5(4), 1–19.

Now that I have the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that highlights each dataset's name, description, and citation. This will ensure that I have a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
