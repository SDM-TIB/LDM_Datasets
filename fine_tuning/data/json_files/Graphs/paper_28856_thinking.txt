To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MuSCLe: A Multi-Strategy Contrastive Learning Framework for Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation" by Kunhao Yuan et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned. The abstract states that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art on the **PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset**, which indicates that this dataset is used in their experiments.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** to gather more details about the dataset. In section 4.1, the authors mention that they conducted extensive experiments on the **PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset**, which is a well-known benchmark for semantic segmentation tasks. They also specify that this dataset contains 20 foreground classes and 1 background class, and they built an augmented training set with 10,582 images.

To ensure I have the correct citation for the dataset, I will check the **References section** of the paper. The citation for the PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset is as follows:
> M. Everingham, L. Van Gool, C. K. I. Williams, J. Winn, and A. Zisserman. *The PASCAL Visual Object Classes Challenge 2012 (VOC2012) Results*. http://www.pascal-network.org/challenges/VOC/voc2012/workshop/index.html.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the findings:

1. **PASCAL VOC 2012 Dataset**: This dataset is used for evaluating the proposed method. It contains 20 foreground classes and 1 background class, with a total of 10,582 images in the augmented training set.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use, ensuring that the full citation for the dataset is included.
