To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Predicting the clinical citation count of biomedical papers using multilayer perceptron neural network" by Xin Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study involves a dataset of **9,822,620 biomedical papers published from 1985 to 2005**, which is a significant dataset for the analysis.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **methodology section**. Here, the authors describe how they collected data from the **PubMed Knowledge Graph (PKG)**, which is a comprehensive source containing over 30 million papers. This is crucial as it serves as the primary dataset for their analysis.

In the **data collection subsection**, the authors provide details about the dataset, including the total number of biomedical papers (9,822,620) and the number of clinical papers (378,876) used for their study. They also mention the average number of references for these clinical papers (26.7), which adds context to the dataset's characteristics.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the dataset sources. The authors reference the **PubMed Knowledge Graph** as their data source, which is essential for proper citation.

The citation for the **PubMed Knowledge Graph** is:
> Xu, J., Kim, S., Song, M., Jeong, M., Kim, D., Kang, J., Rousseau, J. F., Li, X., Xu, W., Torvik, V. I., Bu, Y., Chen, C., Ebeid, I. A., Li, D., & Ding, Y. (2020). Building a PubMed knowledge graph. *Scientific Data*, 7(1), 205.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries based on the information gathered:

1. **Dataset Name**: PubMed Knowledge Graph
   - **Description**: A comprehensive, open access, and enhanced database containing over 30 million biomedical papers with rich metadata, including citation relationships.
   - **Citation**: Xu, J., Kim, S., Song, M., Jeong, M., Kim, D., Kang, J., Rousseau, J. F., Li, X., Xu, W., Torvik, V. I., Bu, Y., Chen, C., Ebeid, I. A., Li, D., & Ding, Y. (2020). Building a PubMed knowledge graph. *Scientific Data*, 7(1), 205.

2. **Dataset Name**: Biomedical Papers Dataset
   - **Description**: A dataset consisting of 9,822,620 biomedical papers published from 1985 to 2005, used for predicting clinical citation counts.
   - **Citation**: Not applicable as this dataset is derived from the PubMed Knowledge Graph.

3. **Dataset Name**: Clinical Papers Dataset
   - **Description**: A subset of the biomedical papers dataset, containing 378,876 clinical papers used for analysis of clinical citation counts.
   - **Citation**: Not applicable as this dataset is derived from the PubMed Knowledge Graph.

After gathering all relevant information, I will ensure that the dataset entries are structured appropriately for further processing or review.
