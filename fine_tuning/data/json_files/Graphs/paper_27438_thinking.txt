To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Graph Convolutional Network for Swahili News Classification" by Alexandros Kastanos and Tyler Martin, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of a Text Graph Convolutional Network for Swahili news classification, which suggests that there is a dataset involved. The introduction discusses the challenges of low-resource languages and the need for annotated datasets, indicating that the authors likely reference specific datasets later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, specifically **subsection 4.1 (Data)**, where the authors explicitly mention the "Swahili News Classification dataset." This section provides details about the dataset, including the number of samples and the categories into which the news articles are classified. The dataset is described as containing 23,266 labeled samples divided into training, validation, and test sets.

I will also take note of the citation provided for the dataset, which is attributed to David (2020). To ensure I have the full citation, I will check the **References section** of the paper. The citation for the dataset is:

- **Swahili News Classification Dataset**: 
  > David, M. (2020). *Swahili: News classification dataset*. 

This citation is crucial for proper attribution and should be included in the dataset entry.

Now, I will summarize the dataset details:
- The dataset is used for categorizing news articles into six categories: kitaifa (national), michezo (sports), burudani (entertainment), uchumi (economy), kimataifa (international), and afya (health).
- The dataset is divided into training, validation, and test sets with a total of 23,266 labeled samples.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and full citation, ensuring that all necessary details are accurately represented for future reference or processing.
