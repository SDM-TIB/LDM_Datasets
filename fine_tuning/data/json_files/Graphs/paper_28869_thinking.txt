To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Joint Morphological Profiles and Patch Tensor Change Detection for Hyperspectral Imagery" by Zengfu Hou and Wei Li, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that experiments were conducted on two real hyperspectral datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **Section III (Experiments Results and Discussion)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention two datasets:

1. **Hermiston Dataset**: This dataset consists of a pair of bi-temporal hyperspectral images collected from an irrigated agricultural field in Hermiston City, Oregon, USA. The images were acquired on May 1, 2004, and May 8, 2007, respectively. It contains 242 spectral bands and has a spatial resolution of 30 meters, with a size of 390 × 200 pixels. The main change observed is farmland land-cover change.

2. **Yancheng Dataset**: This dataset includes two bi-temporal images collected from a wetland agricultural area in Yancheng City, Jiangsu Province, China, on May 3, 2006, and April 23, 2007. It consists of 154 spectral bands (after removing noisy and water absorption bands) and has a size of 400 × 145 pixels. The primary change type is also farmland land-cover change.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. However, the datasets themselves are not typically cited in the references section of a paper unless they are publicly available datasets with established citations. In this case, the authors do not provide specific citations for the Hermiston and Yancheng datasets, as they appear to be original datasets collected by the authors.

Since the datasets are described in detail within the paper, I will compile the information as follows:

- For the **Hermiston Dataset**, I will note the details provided in the paper, including the location, acquisition dates, number of spectral bands, spatial resolution, and the type of changes observed.

- For the **Yancheng Dataset**, I will similarly summarize the relevant details, including the location, acquisition dates, number of spectral bands, spatial resolution, and the type of changes observed.

Finally, I will ensure that I clearly document the dataset descriptions along with the paper citation for future reference. The citation for the paper is:

> Zengfu Hou and Wei Li. *A Joint Morphological Profiles and Patch Tensor Change Detection for Hyperspectral Imagery*. IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing, 2021.

With this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for further processing or review.
