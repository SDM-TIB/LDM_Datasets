To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Coreference Graph Guidance for Mind-Map Generation" by Zhuowei Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly referenced. The abstract mentions that the authors use a **human-annotated evaluation benchmark with 135 articles**, which suggests that there is a dataset involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, where the authors provide details about the dataset used for their evaluations. They mention that the benchmark consists of **120 articles for testing and 15 articles for validation**, selected from **CNN news articles**. This indicates that the dataset is derived from a specific source.

In the **implementation details section**, the authors specify that they selected **5000 articles from CNN news**, which further clarifies the dataset's origin and size. This information is crucial for accurately describing the dataset.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The authors reference the following papers that are relevant to the dataset:

1. **CNN news articles**: The citation for the dataset is:
   > Hermann, K. M., Kocisky, T., Grefenstette, E., Espeholt, L., Kay, W., Suleyman, M., & Blunsom, P. (2015). Teaching machines to read and comprehend. In Advances in neural information processing systems (NeurIPS), 28.

2. **Related works**: The authors also reference other works that may have datasets or methodologies relevant to their research, but the primary dataset for their experiments is the CNN news articles.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
