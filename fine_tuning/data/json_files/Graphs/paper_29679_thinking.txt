To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Contrastive Graph Multimodal Model for Text Classification in Videos" by Ye Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the construction of a new dataset called **TI-News**, which is dedicated to video text recognition and classification applications. This indicates that there is at least one dataset to extract.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors discuss the lack of existing datasets for video text classification and emphasize the importance of their newly constructed dataset, **TI-News**. This reinforces the significance of this dataset in their research.

In the **experiments section**, specifically section 3.1, the authors provide detailed information about the **TI-News dataset**. They describe it as a large-scale dataset consisting of over 450,000 text-box samples extracted from more than 100 videos across 23 news programs. They also mention the training and testing phases, specifying the number of samples used in each phase.

Now, I will gather the full citation for the **TI-News dataset**. Since the dataset is newly constructed and specific to this paper, I will cite it as follows:

- **TI-News Dataset**: 
  > Ye Liu, Changchong Lu, Chen Lin, Di Yin, Bo Ren. *Contrastive Graph Multimodal Model for Text Classification in Videos*. In Proceedings of the [Conference Name], [Year]. [Additional details if available].

Since the paper does not provide a formal citation for the dataset in the references section, I will use the authors and title of the paper itself as the citation for the dataset.

After compiling this information, I will prepare to create the dataset entry according to the required format, ensuring that the citation is included properly.

In summary, I have identified the **TI-News dataset** as the primary dataset in this paper, and I will document it with the appropriate citation derived from the authors and title of the paper.
