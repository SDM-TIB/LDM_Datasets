To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Should We Be Pre-Training? Exploring End-Task Aware Training in Lieu of Continued Pre-Training" by Lucio M. Dery et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the research context and any datasets that might be referenced. The abstract mentions evaluating methods on "three different low-resource NLP tasks from two domains," which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors describe their experimental setup in **section 4**. Here, they explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments:

1. **S2ORC Dataset**: This dataset is used to construct the computer science (CS) and biomedical (BIOMED) corpora. The authors state that they extracted 1.49 million full-text articles for the CS corpus and 2.71 million for the BIOMED corpus.

2. **ACL-ARC Dataset**: This dataset is used for a citation intent classification task, consisting of 1,688 labeled training examples.

3. **SCIERC Dataset**: This dataset is used to classify relations between entities in scientific articles, with 3,219 labeled examples for training.

4. **CHEMPROT Dataset**: This dataset is used for classifying chemical-protein interactions, containing 4,169 labeled training examples.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

- For the **S2ORC Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Kyle Lo, Lucy Lu Wang, Mark Neumann, Rodney Kinney, and Dan S Weld. *S2ORC: The Semantic Scholar Open Research Corpus*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1911.02782, 2019.

- For the **ACL-ARC Dataset**, the citation is:
  > David Jurgens, Srijan Kumar, Raine Hoover, Dan McFarland, and Dan Jurafsky. *Measuring the Evolution of a Scientific Field through Citation Frames*. Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics, 6:391–406, 2018.

- For the **SCIERC Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yi Luan, Luheng He, Mari Ostendorf, and Hannaneh Hajishirzi. *Multi-task Identification of Entities, Relations, and Coreference for Scientific Knowledge Graph Construction*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1808.09602, 2018.

- For the **CHEMPROT Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Jens Kringelum, Sonny Kim Kjaerulff, Søren Brunak, Ole Lund, Tudor I Oprea, and Olivier Taboureau. *Chemprot-3.0: A Global Chemical Biology Diseases Mapping*. Database, 2016.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant datasets from the paper.
