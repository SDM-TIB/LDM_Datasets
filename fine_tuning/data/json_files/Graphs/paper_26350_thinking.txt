To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Neural Network Branching for Neural Network Verification" by Jingyue Lu and M. Pawan Kumar, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, but I will need to look for specific mentions of datasets in the context of experiments or evaluations.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** in detail. This section typically contains information about the datasets used for validation and testing. I will look for any specific names of datasets, their characteristics, and how they were utilized in the experiments. 

In this paper, the authors mention that they supply a dataset on convolutional neural network verification problems, which is a key point. I will note the details provided about this dataset, including its scope and purpose.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

For the dataset mentioned in this paper, I will summarize the findings as follows:

1. **Convolutional Neural Network Verification Dataset**: The authors state that they provide a dataset covering problems at different difficulty levels over neural networks of various sizes. However, they do not provide a specific citation for this dataset in the references, which may indicate that it is a new dataset created for this research.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and that full citations are included where applicable. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
