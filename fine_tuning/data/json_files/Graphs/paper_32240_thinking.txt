To extract datasets from the research paper titled "HAGNN: Hybrid Aggregation for Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks" by Guanghui Zhu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that extensive experimental results were conducted on five heterogeneous graph datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed present in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors provide a summary of the datasets used in their experiments in **Table IV**, which lists the statistics of the datasets.

The datasets mentioned in the paper are:

1. **DBLP**: A computer science bibliography website containing author (A), paper (P), term (T), and conference (C).
2. **IMDB**: A movie website that includes movie (M), director (D), actor (A), and keyword (K).
3. **Freebase**: A large knowledge graph that includes various types such as book (B), film (F), music (M), organization (O), and business (U).
4. **LastFM**: An online music website containing user (U), artist (A), and tag (T).
5. **PubMed**: A biomedical literature library with gene (G), disease (D), chemical (C), and species (S).

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. The citations may not always be explicitly provided for datasets, but I can infer them based on the context and common knowledge about these datasets.

The full citations for the datasets are:

- **DBLP**: 
  > DBLP Computer Science Bibliography. Available at: https://dblp.org/

- **IMDB**: 
  > IMDb. Available at: https://www.imdb.com/

- **Freebase**: 
  > Freebase. Available at: https://www.freebase.com/

- **LastFM**: 
  > Last.fm. Available at: https://www.last.fm/

- **PubMed**: 
  > PubMed. Available at: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
