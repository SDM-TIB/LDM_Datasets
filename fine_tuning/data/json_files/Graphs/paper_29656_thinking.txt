To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Strongly Augmented Contrastive Clustering" by Xiaozhi Deng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that "extensive experiments are conducted on five challenging image datasets," which indicates that datasets are indeed used in the research.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors describe the datasets used. In this section, they explicitly list the datasets and provide details about each one. I will look for a table or a paragraph that summarizes the datasets, as this is often where such information is consolidated.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention five datasets:

1. **CIFAR-10**: This dataset consists of 60,000 images from 10 object classes.
2. **CIFAR-100**: Similar in size to CIFAR-10, it contains 100 classes grouped into 20 super-classes.
3. **STL-10**: This dataset includes 13,000 color images from 10 classes, sourced from ImageNet.
4. **ImageNet-10**: A subset of ImageNet with 10 classes, each containing 1,300 samples.
5. **ImageNet-Dogs**: This dataset consists of 19,500 dog images from 15 breeds, also sourced from ImageNet.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

- **CIFAR-10**: 
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton. "Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images." 2009.

- **CIFAR-100**: 
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton. "Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images." 2009.

- **STL-10**: 
  > A. Coates, A. Ng, H. Lee. "An analysis of single-layer networks in unsupervised feature learning." In International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics, 2011, pp. 215â€“223.

- **ImageNet-10**: 
  > J. Deng, W. Dong, R. Socher, L. Li, K. Li, and F. Li. "ImageNet: A large-scale hierarchical image database." In IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2009.

- **ImageNet-Dogs**: 
  > J. Deng, W. Dong, R. Socher, L. Li, K. Li, and F. Li. "ImageNet: A large-scale hierarchical image database." In IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2009.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured all necessary details regarding the datasets used in the research.
