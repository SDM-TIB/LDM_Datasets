To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Stethoscope-Guided Supervised Contrastive Learning for Cross-Domain Adaptation on Respiratory Sound Classification" by June-Woo Kim et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that the experimental results were demonstrated on the **ICBHI dataset**, which indicates that this dataset is crucial for the study.

Next, I will look into **section 2 (Preliminaries)**, where the authors provide details about the ICBHI dataset. They describe how the dataset was constructed using four distinct stethoscope types: Meditron, LittC2SE, Litt3200, and AKGC417L. This section also includes a breakdown of the lung sound labels and the number of samples in the training and testing sets.

In **section 4 (Results)**, the authors discuss the performance of their proposed methods on the ICBHI dataset, confirming its significance in their experiments. They report an ICBHI Score of 61.71%, which further emphasizes the dataset's role in their research.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the ICBHI dataset. The relevant citation is:

- For the **ICBHI dataset**, the citation is:
  > BM Rocha, Dimitris Filos, L Mendes, Ioannis Vogiatzis, Eleni Perantoni, E Kaimakamis, P Natsiavas, Ana Oliveira, C J´acome, A Marques, et al., "A respiratory sound database for the development of automated classification," in Precision Medicine Powered by pHealth and Connected Health: ICBHI 2017, Thessaloniki, Greece, 18-21 November 2017. Springer, 2018, pp. 33–37.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry for the ICBHI dataset, ensuring that I include the full citation as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the dataset used in the research paper.
