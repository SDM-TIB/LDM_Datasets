To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Asymmetry Disentanglement Network for Interpretable Acute Ischemic Stroke Infarct Segmentation in Non-Contrast CT Scans" by Haomiao Ni et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors achieved state-of-the-art performance on a public NCCT dataset, which suggests that a specific dataset is being used.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors describe their validation process. They mention using the **AISD dataset**, which is a public non-contrast CT dataset of acute ischemic stroke. The paper states that this dataset includes 345 training scans and 52 testing scans, and it provides details about the manual contouring of ischemic lesions by a doctor.

In the **methodology section**, the authors provide additional context about the dataset, including the xyz spacing values and the preprocessing steps taken to ensure consistent voxel representation. This reinforces the importance of the AISD dataset in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the AISD dataset. The paper cites the dataset as follows:

- **AISD Dataset**: 
  > Liang, K., Han, K., Li, X., Cheng, X., Li, Y., Wang, Y., Yu, Y. *Symmetry-enhanced attention network for acute ischemic infarct segmentation with non-contrast CT images*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer-Assisted Intervention, pp. 432â€“441, Springer, 2021.

With this information, I can now summarize the dataset details:

1. **AISD Dataset**: A public non-contrast CT dataset of acute ischemic stroke, including 345 training scans and 52 testing scans, with ischemic lesions manually contoured by a doctor.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing, ensuring that I include the full citation for the AISD dataset as it is crucial for proper attribution.
