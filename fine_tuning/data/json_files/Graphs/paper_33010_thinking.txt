To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CHAIN: Exploring Global-Local Spatio-Temporal Information for Improved Self-Supervised Video Hashing" by Rukai Wei et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art self-supervised video hashing methods on **four video benchmark datasets**. This indicates that datasets are indeed present in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically **section 4.1 (Dataset and Evaluation Protocols)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention:

1. **UCF101**: This dataset contains 13,320 videos across 101 categories of human actions.
2. **HMDB51**: This dataset consists of 6,849 videos spread across 51 action categories.
3. **FCVID**: This dataset includes 91,223 videos from 239 annotated categories.
4. **ActivityNet**: This dataset covers a broad range of human activities with 200 categories and a total of 14,950 videos.

The authors provide additional details about how they split these datasets for training and testing, which is useful for understanding their experimental setup.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

- For **UCF101**, the citation is:

- For **HMDB51**, the citation is:

- For **FCVID**, the citation is:

- For **ActivityNet**, the citation is:

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes its full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details while extracting the datasets from the paper.
