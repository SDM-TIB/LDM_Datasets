To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Contrastive Search Is What You Need For Neural Text Generation" by Yixuan Su and Nigel Collier, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of the contrastive search method across various benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (specifically sections 4, 5, 6, and 7) where the authors describe their evaluation methods and the datasets used for different tasks. In section 3, they mention using the **WIT dataset** for evaluating isotropy across 16 languages. This dataset is crucial for understanding the isotropy of language models.

In section 5, the authors state that they use the **XSum dataset** for document summarization tasks. This dataset is important for evaluating the performance of their model in generating summaries.

In section 6, they mention using the **HumanEval dataset** for code generation tasks, which is another significant dataset relevant to their experiments.

In section 7, they refer to the **IWSLT14 De-En dataset** for machine translation tasks, which is also essential for their evaluation.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets and their citations in a structured format for clarity and future reference. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their respective citations.
