To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Novel Class Discovery: A Study in Novel Skin Lesions Clustering" by Wei Feng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on the **ISIC 2019** dataset, which is a significant clue that I need to explore further.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (section 3) where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset used. Here, they mention that the ISIC 2019 dataset contains a total of 25,331 dermoscopic images from eight categories, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's scope and application.

In the experiments section, the authors also describe how they sampled from the dataset to maintain category balance, which is important for understanding the dataset's usage in their study. They specifically mention treating certain categories as known and others as unknown for their novel class discovery task.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the ISIC 2019 dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Codella, N.C., Gutman, D., Celebi, M.E., Helba, B., Marchetti, M.A., Dusza, S.W., Kalloo, A., Liopyris, K., Mishra, N., Kittler, H., et al. *Skin lesion analysis toward melanoma detection: A challenge at the 2017 international symposium on biomedical imaging (ISBI), hosted by the international skin imaging collaboration (ISIC)*. In Proceedings of the IEEE 15th International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI 2018), pages 168â€“172, IEEE, 2018.

With this information, I can now summarize the dataset:

1. **ISIC 2019 Dataset**: This dataset contains 25,331 dermoscopic images from eight categories: Melanoma (MEL), Melanocytic Nevus (NV), Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC), Actinic Keratosis (AK), Benign Keratosis (BKL), Dermatofibroma (DF), Vascular Lesion (VASC), and Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC). The authors used this dataset to validate their novel class discovery framework.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry with the full citation into a structured format for further processing. This ensures that I have accurately captured the necessary details and citations for the dataset used in the research paper.
