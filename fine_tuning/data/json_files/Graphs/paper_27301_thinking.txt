To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Contrastive Embeddings for Neural Architectures" by Daniel Hesslow and Iacopo Poli, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will look for any mentions of datasets or benchmarks used in the study.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Architecture Search)**, where the authors discuss their evaluation methods. Here, they mention using the **NAS-Bench-201** benchmark for their experiments. This is a clear indication that a dataset is involved, and I will need to gather more details about it.

In the **experiments section**, I will look for specific details about the datasets used, including their characteristics and any relevant statistics. The authors mention that they evaluated their method on the **NAS-Bench-201** benchmark, which consists of two different search spaces: topology and size. I will note down these details as they are crucial for understanding the context in which the dataset is used.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the **NAS-Bench-201** dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Xuanyi Dong and Yi Yang. *NATS-Bench: Benchmarking NAS Algorithms for Architecture Topology and Size*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2009.00437, 2020.

Since this is the only dataset mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the dataset.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for **NAS-Bench-201**, ensuring that all relevant details are included for clarity and completeness.
