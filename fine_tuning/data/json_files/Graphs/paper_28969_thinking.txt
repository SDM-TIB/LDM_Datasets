To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Cross-Level Contrastive Learning and Consistency Constraint for Semi-Supervised Medical Image Segmentation" by Xinkai Zhao et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. In the abstract, the authors state that they evaluated their method on two medical image datasets for polyp and skin lesion segmentation. This indicates that datasets are involved, but I need to find their specific names.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experiments)**, where the authors provide details about the datasets used. They mention two datasets:

1. **Kvasir-SEG Dataset**: This dataset contains 1,000 white-light colonoscopy images with pixel-level manual labels. The authors specify how they split the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets, which is important for understanding its structure.

2. **ISIC 2018 Dataset**: This dataset consists of 2,594 skin images with pixel-level lesion labels. Similar to the Kvasir-SEG dataset, the authors describe how they divided this dataset into training, validation, and testing sets.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Kvasir-SEG Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Debesh Jha, Pia H Smedsrud, Michael A Riegler, Pål Halvorsen, Thomas de Lange, Dag Johansen, and Håvard D Johansen. *Kvasir-seg: A segmented polyp dataset*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Multimedia Modeling, pages 451–462, 2020.

- For the **ISIC 2018 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Noel Codella, Veronica Rotemberg, Philipp Tschandl, M Emre Celebi, Stephen Dusza, David Gutman, Brian Helba, Aadi Kalloo, Konstantinos Liopyris, Michael Marchetti, et al. *Skin lesion analysis toward melanoma detection 2018: A challenge hosted by the international skin imaging collaboration (isic)*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1902.03368, 2019.

With these citations in hand, I will now compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.
