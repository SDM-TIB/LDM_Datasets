To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Hierarchical Message-Passing Graph Neural Networks" by Zhiqiang Zhong et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that empirical experiments were conducted on **9 datasets**, which indicates that there are multiple datasets to extract.

Next, I will focus on **Section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the datasets used for their experiments. I will look for any tables or lists that summarize the datasets, as these often contain key information such as dataset names, tasks, and statistics.

In **Table 3**, the authors summarize the statistics of the datasets used, which includes the following datasets:

1. **Grid**: A synthetic 2D grid graph with 400 nodes and no node features, used for link prediction.
2. **Cora**: A citation network with 2,708 scientific publications, 5,429 links, and 1,433-dimensional node features, used for both link prediction and node classification.
3. **Power**: An electrical grid graph with 4,941 nodes and no node features, used for link prediction.
4. **Citeseer**: A citation network with 3,312 scientific publications, 4,660 links, and 3,703-dimensional node features, used for node classification.
5. **Pubmed**: A dataset of 19,717 scientific publications from the PubMed database, with 500-dimensional node features, used for node classification.
6. **Emails**: A dataset of email communication graphs with no node features, used for community detection.
7. **PPI**: A protein-protein interaction network with 56,658 nodes and 50-dimensional node features, used for node classification.
8. **Protein**: A dataset of 1,113 protein graphs with 29-dimensional node features, used for node classification.
9. **Ogbn-arxiv**: A large-scale citation graph with 169,343 nodes and 128-dimensional node features, used for node classification.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The citations may not always be provided directly in the paper, but I will look for any references that correspond to the datasets.

For example, the citations for the datasets might look like this:

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
