To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Cached Operator Reordering: A Unified View for Fast GNN Training" by Julia Bazinska et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract and introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions, and the introduction typically outlines the context and significance of the research, which may include references to datasets used.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically **section 4 (Evaluation)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for benchmarking their methods. In this section, I will look for a table or a list that summarizes the datasets, including their characteristics such as the number of nodes, edges, features, and classes.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find a table (Table 4) that summarizes the datasets used in the experiments. The datasets mentioned are:

1. **Cora**: A citation network dataset with 2,708 nodes, 5,429 edges, and 7 classes.
2. **Citeseer**: Another citation network dataset with 3,327 nodes, 4,732 edges, and 6 classes.
3. **PubMed**: A dataset with 19,717 nodes, 44,338 edges, and 3 classes.
4. **Flickr**: A social network dataset with 899,756 nodes, 2,062,000 edges, and 7 classes.
5. **OGB-Arxiv**: A dataset from the Open Graph Benchmark with 169,343 nodes, 1,166,243 edges, and 40 classes.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The paper cites the following sources for the datasets:

- For **Cora**, **Citeseer**, and **PubMed**, the citation is:
  > Zhilin Yang, William W. Cohen, and Ruslan Salakhutdinov. *Revisiting Semi-Supervised Learning with Graph Embeddings*. CoRR abs/1603.08861 (2016).

- For **Flickr**, the citation is:
  > Hanqing Zeng, Hongkuan Zhou, Ajitesh Srivastava, Rajgopal Kannan, and Viktor Prasanna. *Graph-SAINT: Graph Sampling Based Inductive Learning Method*. arXiv:1907.04931 (2020).

- For **OGB-Arxiv**, the citation is:
  > Weihua Hu, Matthias Fey, Marinka Zitnik, et al. *Open Graph Benchmark: Datasets for Machine Learning on Graphs*. Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 2020-December (2020).

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and future reference. Each dataset will include its name, characteristics, and full citation.

This systematic approach ensures that I have accurately captured all relevant datasets and their citations from the research paper.
