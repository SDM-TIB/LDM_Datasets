To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SoMeR: Multi-View User Representation Learning for Social Media" by Siyi Guo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and applications sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the versatility of the SoMeR framework and its applications, which may hint at the datasets used.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to see if the authors discuss any specific datasets that have been previously used in user representation learning or related studies. This section often provides context and may reference foundational datasets.

In the **methods section**, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets used for training or evaluation. The authors describe their framework and its components, and they may provide details about the datasets utilized in their experiments.

The **applications section** is crucial as it describes two specific applications of the SoMeR framework: detecting inauthentic accounts and measuring polarization in online discussions. I will check if the authors mention specific datasets used for these applications.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find the following datasets mentioned:

1. **X Dataset for Information Operation Detection**: This dataset includes accounts associated with information operations across multiple campaigns in various countries. The authors mention that it contains data from 21 countries and includes control users for comparison.

2. **Public Dataset on Abortion Discussions**: This dataset contains tweets related to abortion rights, specifically focusing on discussions that occurred after the SCOTUS ruling on June 24, 2022. The authors specify that it includes about 10 million posts from users with at least 20 posts.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the **references section** of the paper:

- For the **X Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Pacheco, D., Hui, P.-M., Torres-Lugo, C., Truong, B. T., Flammini, A., & Menczer, F. (2021). Uncovering coordinated networks on social media: methods and case studies. In Proceedings of the International AAAI Conference on Web and Social Media, volume 15, pages 455–466.

- For the **Public Dataset on Abortion Discussions**, the citation is:
  > Chang, R.-C., Rao, A., Zhong, Q., Wojcieszak, M., & Lerman, K. (2023). #InRoeOverturned: Twitter dataset on the abortion rights controversy. Proceedings of the International AAAI Conference on Web and Social Media, volume 17, pages 997–1005.

After collecting this information, I will summarize the datasets in a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation for proper attribution. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research.
