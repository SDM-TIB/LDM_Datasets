To extract datasets from the research paper titled "TabGSL: Graph Structure Learning for Tabular Data Prediction" by Jay Chiehen Liao and Cheng-Te Li, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract states that the authors conducted experiments on **30 benchmark tabular datasets**, which indicates that multiple datasets are involved.

Next, I will look for a dedicated section that discusses the datasets in detail. In this case, the **experiments section (Section 5)** provides information about the datasets used. The authors mention that they selected datasets from the **OpenML-CC18 benchmark**, which contains thousands of real-world classification datasets.

I will then check the **Appendix** for a detailed table that lists the statistics of the datasets used in the experiments. This table (Table 4) provides the dataset IDs, number of instances, number of features, and other relevant details.

The datasets mentioned in the paper are as follows:

1. **OpenML Dataset 23**: Contains 1473 instances and 9 features.
2. **OpenML Dataset 31**: Contains 1000 instances and 20 features.
3. **OpenML Dataset 48**: Contains 151 instances and 5 features.
4. **OpenML Dataset 446**: Contains 200 instances and 7 features.
5. **OpenML Dataset 475**: Contains 400 instances and 5 features.
6. **OpenML Dataset 720**: Contains 4177 instances and 8 features.
7. **OpenML Dataset 825**: Contains 506 instances and 20 features.
8. **OpenML Dataset 853**: Contains 297 instances and 13 features.
9. **OpenML Dataset 902**: Contains 69 instances and 6 features.
10. **OpenML Dataset 915**: Contains 182 instances and 13 features.
11. **OpenML Dataset 941**: Contains 99 instances and 9 features.
12. **OpenML Dataset 955**: Contains 99 instances and 5 features.
13. **OpenML Dataset 983**: Contains 844 instances and 9 features.
14. **OpenML Dataset 1006**: Contains 81 instances and 18 features.
15. **OpenML Dataset 1012**: Contains 125 instances and 28 features.
16. **OpenML Dataset 1115**: Contains 52 instances and 6 features.
17. **OpenML Dataset 1167**: Contains 213 instances and 8 features.
18. **OpenML Dataset 1498**: Contains 302 instances and 9 features.
19. **OpenML Dataset 1549**: Contains 165 instances and 40 features.
20. **OpenML Dataset 1552**: Contains 305 instances and 12 features.
21. **OpenML Dataset 1553**: Contains 240 instances and 12 features.
22. **OpenML Dataset 1555**: Contains 245 instances and 40 features.
23. **OpenML Dataset 1557**: Contains 240 instances and 8 features.
24. **OpenML Dataset 40663**: Contains 1100 instances and 32 features.
25. **OpenML Dataset 40705**: Contains 1000 instances and 44 features.
26. **OpenML Dataset 40710**: Contains 898 instances and 13 features.
27. **OpenML Dataset 40981**: Contains 1000 instances and 14 features.
28. **OpenML Dataset 43255**: Contains 4177 instances and 7 features.
29. **OpenML Dataset 43942**: Contains 300 instances and 38 features.
30. **OpenML Dataset 44098**: Contains 300 instances and 20 features.

Next, I will retrieve the full citations for the datasets. Since these datasets are sourced from the OpenML-CC18 benchmark, I will provide the citation for the benchmark itself:

- **OpenML-CC18 Benchmark**:

Now, I will compile the dataset entries along with their citations into a structured format for further processing.
