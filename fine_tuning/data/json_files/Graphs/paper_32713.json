The dataset is generated by applying electro-discharge machining (EDM) to motor deep groove ball bearings to artificially induce faults. Specifically, faults with diameters of 0.007 inches, 0.014 inches, and 0.021 inches are introduced into the inner race, outer race, and ball of the bearings, respectively. Vibration data is recorded at both the drive-end (DE) and fan-end (FE) under varying motor loads and speeds.",
