To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Referring Video Object Segmentation from Weak Annotation" by Wangbo Zhao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions a new annotation scheme and references the **YouTube-RVOS dataset** as a basis for their experiments. This indicates that there is at least one dataset to extract.

Next, I will look for specific sections that discuss datasets in detail. The **experiments section** is likely to contain information about the datasets used for training and evaluation. In this case, I will focus on any sections that explicitly mention datasets, such as a dedicated **Datasets** section or within the **Methodology** or **Experiments** sections.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention using the **YouTube-RVOS dataset** for their experiments. They describe how they modified the dataset by keeping the mask for the first frame where the target object appears and using bounding boxes for subsequent frames. This is a crucial detail that highlights how they adapted the dataset for their weak annotation scheme.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the **YouTube-RVOS dataset**. The citation is as follows:
> Seo, S., Lee, J.-Y., & Han, B. (2020). URVOS: Unified Referring Video Object Segmentation Network with a Large-Scale Benchmark. In European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), pp. 208â€“223.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets, I will conclude that the only dataset extracted is the **YouTube-RVOS dataset**.

Finally, I will compile the extracted dataset information, ensuring to include the full citation as required. This will be structured in a clear format for easy reference in future work or analysis.
