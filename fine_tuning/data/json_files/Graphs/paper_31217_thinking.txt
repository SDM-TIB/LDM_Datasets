To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "HTNET: HUMAN TOPOLOGY AWARE NETWORK FOR 3D HUMAN POSE ESTIMATION" by Jialun Cai et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors achieved state-of-the-art results on two benchmark datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they refer to:

1. **Human3.6M**: This dataset is described as the largest indoor dataset for 3D human pose estimation, containing 3.6 million images and featuring 11 professional actors. The authors mention that they use Mean Per Joint Position Error (MPJPE) and Procrustes MPJPE (P-MPJPE) as evaluation metrics.

2. **MPI-INF-3DHP**: This dataset consists of 1.3 million images captured from both indoor and outdoor scenes. The authors note that it includes three different scenes in its test set: studio with a green screen, studio without a green screen, and outdoor scenes. The evaluation metrics mentioned for this dataset include MPJPE, Percentage of Correct Keypoint (PCK), and Area Under Curve (AUC).

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Human3.6M**, the citation is:
  > Catalin Ionescu, Dragos Papava, Vlad Olaru, and Cristian Sminchisescu. *Human3.6M: Large scale datasets and predictive methods for 3D human sensing in natural environments*. IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence (TPAMI), vol. 36, no. 7, pp. 1325–1339, 2013.

- For **MPI-INF-3DHP**, the citation is:
  > Dushyant Mehta, Helge Rhodin, Dan Casas, Pascal Fua, Oleksandr Sotnychenko, Weipeng Xu, and Christian Theobalt. *Monocular 3D human pose estimation in the wild using improved CNN supervision*. In Proceedings of the 3D Vision (3DV), 2017, pp. 506–516.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will prepare to compile this information into a structured format for further use.
