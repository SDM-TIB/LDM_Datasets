To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Hybrid Low-order and Higher-order Graph Convolutional Networks" by FangYuan Lei et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the proposed model is verified on **large-scale text network datasets** and **citation network datasets**, indicating that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiment)**, where the authors describe their experimental setup. In **subsection 4.1 (Supervised text network classification)**, they list five benchmark text datasets used for evaluation:

1. **R52**: A dataset from Reuters 21578 containing 9,100 documents, with 5,532 for training and 2,568 for testing.
2. **OH**: Another dataset from Reuters 21578 with 7,400 documents, 3,357 for training, and 4,043 for testing.
3. **20-Newsgroups (20NG)**: A dataset with 18,846 documents, 11,314 for training, and 7,532 for testing.
4. **R8**: A subset of Reuters 21578 with 7,674 documents, 5,485 for training, and 2,189 for testing.
5. **Movie Review (MR)**: A dataset with 10,662 documents, 7,108 for training, and 3,554 for testing.

In **subsection 4.2 (Semi-supervised node classification)**, the authors mention three citation network datasets:

1. **Cora**: Contains 2,708 nodes, 5,429 edges, and 1,433 features.
2. **Citeseer**: Contains 3,327 nodes, 4,732 edges, and 3,703 features.
3. **Pubmed**: Contains 19,717 nodes, 44,338 edges, and 500 features.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all relevant details are accurately captured for future reference or processing.
