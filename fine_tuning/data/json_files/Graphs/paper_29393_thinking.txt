To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Public awareness and attitudes towards search engine optimization" by Dirk Lewandowski and Sebastian Schultheiß, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that an online survey was conducted with a sample of 2,012 German internet users, which suggests that the survey data is a key dataset.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of the dataset in the **methods section**. Here, the authors describe the survey's design and the demographic data collected, which includes age, gender, education level, and preferred search engine. This information is crucial for understanding the dataset's structure.

In the **results section**, I will check for any tables or figures that summarize the findings from the survey. For instance, Table 1 provides demographic information about the sample, and other tables present results related to public awareness of paid search marketing (PSM) and search engine optimization (SEO). These tables indicate that the dataset contains responses to various survey questions, which can be considered as part of the dataset.

I will also look for any references to the dataset's availability or citation in the **acknowledgments or references sections**. The authors mention that the research data is available at OSF (Open Science Framework) with a DOI link: https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/JYV9R. This is essential for providing a full citation for the dataset.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring to include the full citation for the dataset:

1. **Dataset Name**: Online Survey Data on Public Awareness and Attitudes towards SEO
   - **Description**: This dataset includes responses from 2,012 German internet users regarding their awareness of search engine optimization and paid search marketing, collected through an online survey.
   - **Citation**: Lewandowski, D., & Schultheiß, S. (2022). Public awareness and attitudes towards search engine optimization. *Behaviour & Information Technology*. https://doi.org/10.1080/0144929X.2022.2056507

After gathering all this information, I will ensure that the dataset entry is clear and concise, ready for any further processing or review.
