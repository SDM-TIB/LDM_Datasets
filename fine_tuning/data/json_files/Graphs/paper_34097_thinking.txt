To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-Modal Contrastive Learning for Online Clinical Time-Series Applications" by Fabian Baldenweg et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors utilize Electronic Health Record (EHR) datasets from Intensive Care Units (ICUs), which suggests that there are specific datasets involved.

Next, I will examine **section 4 (Results and Discussion)**, where the authors describe their experimental setup. They mention using the **MIMIC-III dataset** for their experiments, which is a well-known dataset in the medical domain. I will look for specific details about how this dataset is utilized in their study.

In **section A (Data)**, the authors provide further details about the tasks and datasets. They explicitly state that they benchmark two mortality-related tasks defined by Harutyunyan et al. (2019) on the MIMIC-III dataset. This confirms that MIMIC-III is indeed a primary dataset used in their research.

Now, I will gather the full citation for the MIMIC-III dataset from the **References section**. The citation is as follows:
> Johnson, A. E. W., Pollard, T. J., Shen, L., Lehman, L. H., Feng, M., Ghassemi, M., Moody, B., Szolovits, P., Celi, L. A., & Mark, R. G. (2016). MIMIC-III, a freely accessible critical care database. *Scientific Data*, 3(1), 160035. doi:10.1038/sdata.2016.35.

Additionally, I will note that the authors also reference the work of Harutyunyan et al. (2019) regarding the cohort selection and patient splits for training, which is relevant to the dataset's application but does not constitute a separate dataset.

After compiling this information, I will ensure that I have accurately captured the dataset's name, description, and full citation. The final output will include the MIMIC-III dataset as the primary dataset used in the research.

In summary, the steps I will take are:
1. Read the abstract and introduction for initial mentions of datasets.
2. Review the results and discussion sections for detailed descriptions of datasets used.
3. Collect full citations from the references for each dataset mentioned.
4. Compile the information into a structured format for clarity and completeness.

This systematic approach will ensure that I accurately extract and cite the datasets used in the research paper.
