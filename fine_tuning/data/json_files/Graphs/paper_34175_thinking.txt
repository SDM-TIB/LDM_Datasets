To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CDAD-NET: Bridging Domain Gaps in Generalized Category Discovery" by Sai Bhargav Rongali et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental evaluation sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their method on three AD-GCD benchmarks, which indicates that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental evaluations section** where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention:

1. **Office-Home Dataset**: This dataset is used for evaluating the performance of the proposed method across different domain pairs. The authors specify that it consists of images from various domains, which are categorized into known and novel classes.

2. **PACS Dataset**: Similar to Office-Home, this dataset is also utilized for testing the method's effectiveness in cross-domain scenarios. It includes images from different domains, and the authors provide details about the class distributions.

3. **DomainNet Dataset**: This dataset is mentioned as another benchmark for evaluating the proposed method. The authors describe the various domain pairs considered for their experiments.

Additionally, the authors refer to two within-domain datasets:

4. **CIFAR-10 Dataset**: This dataset is commonly used for image classification tasks and is mentioned in the context of within-domain class discovery.

5. **ImageNet-100 Dataset**: Another well-known dataset used for evaluating the performance of the proposed method in a within-domain setting.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Office-Home Dataset**, the citation is:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
