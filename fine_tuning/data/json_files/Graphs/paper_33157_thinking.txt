To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Supervised Contrastive Learning Pretrain-Finetune Approach for Time Series" by Trang H. Tran et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions a novel pretraining procedure and indicates that the authors conducted experiments on various datasets. This suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section**, which is often where authors describe the datasets they used for their experiments. In this paper, I find that **section 4.1 (Experiment Settings)** explicitly lists the datasets used. The authors mention the following datasets:

1. **ETTh1**: This dataset contains time series data collected at hourly intervals, specifically from electricity transformers, load, and oil temperature data recorded from July 2016 to July 2018.

2. **ETTm1**: This dataset is similar to ETTh1 but has data collected at 15-minute intervals.

3. **Electricity**: This dataset records hourly electricity consumption data from 321 customers over a three-year period.

4. **Exchange-Rate**: This dataset contains daily exchange rate data from eight different countries spanning from 1990 to 2016.

5. **Traffic**: This dataset records hourly traffic data from the California Department of Transportation, including road occupancy rates.

6. **Weather**: This dataset provides 21 meteorological indicators recorded at 10-minute intervals throughout the year 2020.

7. **ILI**: This dataset includes weekly data on influenza-like illness (ILI) patients from the CDC between 2002 and 2021.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
