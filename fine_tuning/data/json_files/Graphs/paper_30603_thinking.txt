To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CLOP: Video-and-Language Pre-Training with Knowledge Regularizations" by Guohao Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions evaluating the method on "four text-video retrieval tasks and one multi-choice QA task," which suggests that there are datasets involved, but I need to identify them specifically.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In **Section 4.1 (Experiment Settings)**, the authors mention the use of the **WebVid2M dataset** for pre-training, which consists of 2.5 million video-text pairs scraped from the web. This is a significant dataset for their work.

Continuing in **Section 4.2 (Overall Results on End Tasks)**, the authors list several datasets used for evaluation:

1. **MSRVTT**: A well-known dataset for text-video retrieval, consisting of 10,000 videos, each associated with 20 text descriptions. The authors follow the official 1k-A split for training and evaluation.

2. **MSVD**: This dataset contains 1,970 videos with about 40 text descriptions per video, split into training, validation, and testing sets.

3. **VATEX**: A large-scale multilingual video-text dataset containing 34,991 videos, with specific splits for training, validation, and testing.

4. **DiDeMo**: This dataset includes 10,000 flickr videos and 40,000 localized text annotations, used for paragraph-to-video retrieval tasks.

5. **MSRVTT Multi-choice QA**: This task uses the MSRVTT training videos and evaluates video-text relevance similar to retrieval tasks.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries with their full citations to ensure they are ready for any required structured output or further processing.
