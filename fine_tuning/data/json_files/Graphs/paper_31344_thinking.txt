To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Automated Ventricle Parcellation and Evan’s Ratio Computation in Pre- and Post-Surgical Ventriculomegaly" by Yuli Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's goals and mentions that experimental results were demonstrated on multiple datasets, which indicates that datasets are present.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors discuss the challenges of diagnosing normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) and the need for automated methods. They mention the use of MRI images but do not specify datasets yet.

In the **experiments section**, I will look for a dedicated subsection that discusses the datasets used. Here, the authors explicitly mention three datasets:

1. **Healthy Controls Dataset**: This dataset consists of 50 MRIs from healthy controls sourced from Neuromorphometrics Inc. (NMM). The authors detail how they split the dataset into training, validation, and testing subsets.

2. **NPH Subjects Dataset**: This dataset includes 95 MRIs from NPH patients, with a similar training, validation, and testing split as the healthy controls dataset.

3. **Post-Surgical NPH Subjects Dataset (PS-NPH)**: This dataset contains 6 MRIs of post-surgical subjects, which were used exclusively for testing.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citation for the Healthy Controls dataset is:

- Neuromorphometrics Inc. (NMM). *Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS): cross-sectional MRI data in young, middle aged, nondemented, and demented older adults*. Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience, vol. 19, no. 9, pp. 1498–1507, 2007.

For the NPH subjects dataset, the authors reference a previous study, which I will need to locate in the references. The citation is:

- M. Shao et al. *Brain ventricle parcellation using a deep neural network: Application to patients with ventriculomegaly*. NeuroImage: Clinical, vol. 23, p. 101871, 2019.

The post-surgical dataset does not have a specific citation as it is a small cohort used in this study, but I will note that it is part of the experimental results.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations, ensuring that I include all necessary details for each dataset. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the study, along with their full citations for proper attribution.
