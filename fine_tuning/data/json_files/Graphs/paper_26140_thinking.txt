To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Uncovering Dominant Social Class in Neighborhoods through Building Footprints: A Case Study of Residential Zones in Massachusetts using Computer Vision" by Qianhui Liang and Zhoutong Wang, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors use figure-ground maps to analyze urban form and social class, which suggests that there may be datasets related to these maps.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the relationship between urban form and social attributes, hinting at the use of specific datasets for their analysis. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or data sources.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly the subsection on data preprocessing. Here, the authors mention obtaining land-use data from the Massachusetts government website and using Microsoftâ€™s building footprint dataset. This is crucial as it directly points to the datasets used in their research.

The authors specify that they generated figure-ground image patches from the Microsoft footprint dataset, which is a significant dataset for their analysis. They also mention using zip-code level income data from the U.S. Census in 2017, which is another important dataset.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the **references section**:

1. **Microsoft Building Footprints Dataset**:
   > Microsoft. *US Building Footprints*. June 2018. Available at: https://github.com/Microsoft/USBuildingFootprints

2. **Massachusetts Land Use Data**:
   > Massachusetts Document Repository, MassGIS Data: Land Use (2005), June 2009. Available at: https://docs.digital.mass.gov/dataset/massgis-data-land-use-2005

3. **U.S. Census Income Data**:
   > Income By Zip Code, US Statistics, October 2018. Available at: https://www.incomebyzipcode.com/massachusetts

After identifying these datasets and their citations, I will compile the information into a structured format that clearly describes each dataset, ensuring that the full citations are included as required.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for review or further processing, ensuring that all relevant details are accurately captured.
