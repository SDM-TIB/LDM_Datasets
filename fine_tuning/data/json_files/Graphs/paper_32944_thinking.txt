To extract datasets from the research paper titled "FLEE-GNN: A Federated Learning System for Edge-Enhanced Graph Neural Network in Analyzing Geospatial Resilience of Multicommodity Food Flows" by Yuxiao Qu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the development of FLEE-GNN and its application to food supply networks, which suggests that datasets related to food flows are likely involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used in their experiments. They state that they utilize the U.S. Commodity Flow Survey (CFS) data, which provides comprehensive information on domestic freight shipments, including commodity type, value, weight, and distance shipped. This section will likely contain specific details about the datasets they processed.

The authors mention that they focus on agricultural multi-commodity flows in 2012 and 2017, extracting data with Standard Classification of Transported Goods (SCTG) codes from 01 to 08. This indicates that they have created two primary datasets based on these years.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The U.S. Commodity Flow Survey is a key dataset, and I will ensure to provide its citation.

The citation for the U.S. Commodity Flow Survey is:
> U.S. Bureau of Transportation Statistics. *Commodity Flow Survey*. Available at: https://www.bts.gov/product/commodity-flow-survey.

Additionally, the authors mention using an adjustable data generator to create nearly authentic food flow data, which is derived from the original CFS data. However, since this is a method rather than a dataset, I will not include it in the dataset extraction.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citation for the U.S. Commodity Flow Survey, which is the primary dataset referenced in the paper.

In summary, the key dataset extracted from the paper is the U.S. Commodity Flow Survey data, and I will ensure to document its citation accurately.
