To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Semantic-aware Contrastive Learning for Electroencephalography-to-Text Generation with Curriculum Learning" by Xiachong Feng et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions conducting experiments on the **ZuCo benchmark**, which indicates that this is a dataset of interest.

Next, I will focus on **section 3.2 (ZuCo Benchmark)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the dataset. They explain that the ZuCo dataset is a corpus of EEG signals and eye-tracking data collected during natural reading, specifically from movie reviews and Wikipedia articles. This section also mentions that the dataset is a combination of two versions: **ZuCo** and **ZuCo 2.0**.

In this section, the authors provide statistics about the dataset, including the number of EEG-text pairs, unique sentences, subjects, and average words per sentence. This information is crucial for understanding the dataset's scope and structure.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the ZuCo dataset. The relevant citations are:

- For **ZuCo**:
  > Hollenstein, N., Rotsztejn, J., Troendle, M., Pedroni, A., Zhang, C., & Langer, N. (2018). ZuCo, a simultaneous EEG and eye-tracking resource for natural sentence reading. *Scientific Data*, 5(1), 1-13.

- For **ZuCo 2.0**:
  > Hollenstein, N., Troendle, M., Zhang, C., & Langer, N. (2020). ZuCo 2.0: A dataset of physiological recordings during natural reading and annotation. In *Proceedings of the Twelfth Language Resources and Evaluation Conference* (pp. 138-146). Marseille, France: European Language Resources Association.

With this information, I can now summarize the datasets extracted from the paper:

1. **ZuCo Dataset**: A corpus of EEG signals and eye-tracking data collected during natural reading, consisting of EEG-text pairs derived from movie reviews and Wikipedia articles.

2. **ZuCo 2.0 Dataset**: An updated version of the original ZuCo dataset, providing additional physiological recordings during natural reading.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries with their full citations for further processing.
