To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Center-wise Local Image Mixture" by Hao Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses a new contrastive learning method but does not explicitly mention datasets. However, the introduction may provide insights into the datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental results section** (section 4), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention evaluating their method on **ImageNet** and other benchmarks. I will look for specific details about these datasets, including their characteristics and any relevant citations.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention using **ImageNet 2012** for training and evaluation. They also refer to several downstream tasks, including object detection and instance segmentation on datasets like **PASCAL VOC** and **COCO**. I will need to confirm the details and citations for these datasets.

Now, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. **ImageNet 2012**: The citation is:
   > Olga Russakovsky, Jia Deng, Hao Su, Jonathan Krause, Sanjeev Satheesh, Sean Ma, Zhiheng Huang, Andrej Karpathy, Aditya Khosla, Michael Bernstein, et al. *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 115(3):211–252, 2015.

2. **PASCAL VOC**: The citation is:
   > Shaoqing Ren, Kaiming He, Ross Girshick, and Jian Sun. *Faster R-CNN: Towards Real-Time Object Detection with Region Proposal Networks*. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, pages 91–99, 2015.

3. **COCO**: The citation is:
   > Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, Sergio F. G. Vasconcelos, et al. *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. In European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), pages 740–755, 2014.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets:

- **ImageNet 2012**: A large-scale dataset used for training and evaluating visual recognition models.
- **PASCAL VOC**: A benchmark dataset for object detection and segmentation tasks.
- **COCO**: A dataset designed for object detection, segmentation, and captioning tasks.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
