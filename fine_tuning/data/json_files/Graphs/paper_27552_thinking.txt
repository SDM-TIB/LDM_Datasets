To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "TedNet: A Pytorch Toolkit for Tensor Decomposition Networks" by Yu Pan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and benchmark sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the toolkit, but I need to focus on the benchmark section where datasets are likely to be mentioned.

In the **benchmark section (Section 4)**, the authors explicitly mention two datasets used for their experiments:

1. **UCF11 Dataset**: This dataset contains 1,600 video clips categorized into 11 action categories, with each category consisting of 25 groups of videos, and more than 4 clips in each group.

2. **CIFAR10/100 Dataset**: This dataset consists of 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images, with each image sized at 32 × 32 × 3. CIFAR10 has 10 object classes, while CIFAR100 has 100 categories.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. 

- For the **UCF11 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Y. Yang, D. Krompass, V. Tresp. *Tensor-train recurrent neural networks for video classification*. In Proceedings of the 34th International Conference on Machine Learning, ICML 2017, Sydney, NSW, Australia, 6-11 August 2017, Vol. 70 of Proceedings of Machine Learning Research, PMLR, 2017, pp. 3891–3900.

- For the **CIFAR10/100 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Y. Lecun, L. Bottou, Y. Bengio, P. Haffner. *Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition*. Proceedings of the IEEE 86 (11) (1998) 2278–2324.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations. This will ensure that I have a comprehensive record of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for any further processing or review.
