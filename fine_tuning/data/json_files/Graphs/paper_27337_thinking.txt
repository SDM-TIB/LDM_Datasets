To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Visual Models using a Knowledge Graph as a Trainer" by Sebastian Monka et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the datasets used in the study. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their method on visual transfer learning tasks using the **mini-ImageNet dataset** and **road sign recognition datasets from Germany and China**. This indicates that there are at least two datasets involved.

Next, I will look into **section 4 (Experiment)**, where the authors describe their experimental setup in detail. In **section 4.1 (Scenario 1 - Domain Generalization)**, they specify that they use the **mini-ImageNet** dataset as the source domain and evaluate on its derivatives, including **ImageNetV2**, **ImageNet-R**, **ImageNet-Sketch**, and **ImageNet-A**. This gives me a clear list of datasets used for evaluation.

In **section 4.2 (Scenario 2 - Supervised Domain Adaptation)**, the authors mention using the **German Traffic Sign Dataset (GTSRB)** as the source domain and the **Chinese Traffic Sign Dataset (CTSD)** as the target domain. This confirms the presence of two additional datasets.

Now, I will compile the datasets identified:

1. **mini-ImageNet**: A derivative of the ImageNet dataset consisting of 60,000 color images across 100 classes.
2. **ImageNetV2**: A dataset containing new test images per class that closely follows the original labeling protocol.
3. **ImageNet-R**: A dataset with artistic renditions of ImageNet classes.
4. **ImageNet-Sketch**: A dataset containing sketches of ImageNet classes.
5. **ImageNet-A**: A dataset with real-world, unmodified examples that challenge model performance.
6. **German Traffic Sign Dataset (GTSRB)**: Contains 51,970 images of 43 road signs.
7. **Chinese Traffic Sign Dataset (CTSD)**: Contains 6,164 images of 58 road signs.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **mini-ImageNet**, the citation is:

After gathering all this information, I will ensure that each dataset is documented with its respective citation, ready for further processing or review.
