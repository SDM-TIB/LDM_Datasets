To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Artificial-Spiking Hierarchical Networks for Vision-Language Representation Learning" by Yeming Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors validate their model on multiple well-established downstream VL tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors discuss various VL tasks and mention the use of the **Visual Genome (VG)** and **MSCOCO** datasets for pre-training their model. This is a clear indication that these datasets are significant for their research.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide details about the datasets used for various tasks. They specifically mention:

1. **Visual Genome (VG)**: This dataset is used for pre-training and is known for its dense annotations of images, which are useful for various vision-language tasks.

2. **MSCOCO**: Another widely used dataset for image captioning and visual question answering, which contains images annotated with captions and questions.

The authors also mention downstream tasks such as VQA (Visual Question Answering), image-text retrieval, and others, but the primary datasets for pre-training are VG and MSCOCO.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Visual Genome**, the citation is:
  > Krishna, R., Zhu, Y., Yu, T., et al. "Visual Genome: Connecting Language and Vision Using Crowdsourced Dense Image Annotations." In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pp. 32-73, 2017.

- For **MSCOCO**, the citation is:
  > Lin, T.-Y., Maire, M., Belongie, S., et al. "Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context." In Proceedings of the European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), pp. 740-755, 2014.

Having gathered this information, I will now compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes its full citation. This will be done in a structured format suitable for further processing or review.
