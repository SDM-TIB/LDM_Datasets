To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Unified Contrastive Transfer Framework with Propagation Structure for Boosting Low-Resource Rumor Detection" by Hongzhan Lin et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on **four low-resource datasets collected from real-world microblog platforms**, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors discuss the datasets used. In **section 5.1 (Datasets)**, they explicitly list the datasets:

1. **TWITTER**: This dataset consists of 1,154 events and 60,409 tree nodes, with a breakdown of 399 non-rumors and 579 rumors. The average time per tree is 389 hours, and the average depth is 11.67. The language is English, and the domain is open.

2. **WEIBO**: This dataset contains 60,409 events and 60409 tree nodes, with 40 non-rumors and 4649 rumors. The average time per tree is 2497 hours, and the average depth is 1007. The language is Chinese, and the domain is COVID-19.

3. **English-COVID19 (EngCovid)**: This dataset has 579 events and 406,185 tree nodes, with 146 non-rumors and 575 rumors. The average time per tree is 248 hours, and the average depth is 4.31. The language is English, and the domain is COVID-19.

4. **Chinese-COVID19 (ChiCovid)**: This dataset consists of 575 events and 195,644 tree nodes, with 253 non-rumors and 68490 rumors. The average time per tree is 2154 hours, and the average depth is 9.98. The language is Chinese, and the domain is COVID-19.

5. **Cantonese-COVID19 (CanCovid)**: This dataset has 389 events and 1481 tree nodes, with 78 non-rumors and 920 rumors. The average time per tree is 140 hours, and the average depth is 561. The language is Cantonese, and the domain is COVID-19.

6. **Arabic-COVID19 (AraCovid)**: This dataset contains 604 events and 2313 tree nodes, with 140 non-rumors and 561 rumors. The average time per tree is 2154 hours, and the average depth is 668. The language is Arabic, and the domain is COVID-19.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The authors refer to the datasets in the context of their experiments, but they do not provide specific citations for each dataset in the references. However, I can infer that the datasets are likely based on publicly available data from platforms like Twitter and Weibo, as well as specific COVID-19 rumor datasets mentioned in the text.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the relevant details and citations where applicable. 

In summary, the datasets extracted from the paper are:

1. **TWITTER**: 
   > No specific citation provided, but it refers to a dataset of events from Twitter.

2. **WEIBO**: 
   > No specific citation provided, but it refers to a dataset of events from Weibo.

3. **English-COVID19 (EngCovid)**: 
   > No specific citation provided, but it refers to a dataset of COVID-19 related tweets.

4. **Chinese-COVID19 (ChiCovid)**: 
   > No specific citation provided, but it refers to a dataset of COVID-19 related posts from Weibo.

5. **Cantonese-COVID19 (CanCovid)**: 
   > No specific citation provided, but it refers to a dataset of COVID-19 related posts in Cantonese.

6. **Arabic-COVID19 (AraCovid)**: 
   > No specific citation provided, but it refers to a dataset of COVID-19 related posts in Arabic.

I will now prepare the structured output for these datasets based on the information gathered.
