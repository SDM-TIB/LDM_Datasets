To extract the datasets mentioned in the paper titled "Boundary-Aware Proposal Generation Method for Temporal Action Localization" by Hao Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the proposed method was evaluated on **THUMOS14** and **ActivityNet-1.3**, indicating that these are the datasets used for the experiments.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (Section III) to gather more details about how these datasets were utilized. In the **Experimental Settings** subsection, the authors provide specific information about each dataset:

1. **THUMOS14**: This dataset consists of 200 validation videos and 213 test videos specifically designed for temporal action localization. The authors mention that they applied training on the validation subset and evaluated model performance on the test subset.

2. **ActivityNet-1.3**: This dataset contains 10,024 videos and 15,410 action instances for training, along with 4,926 videos and 7,654 action instances for validation, and 5,044 videos for testing. The authors state that they trained their method on the training subset and tested it on the validation subset.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **THUMOS14**, the citation is:
  > Yu-Gang Jiang, Jingen Liu, A Roshan Zamir, George Toderici, Ivan Laptev, Mubarak Shah, and Rahul Sukthankar. *Thumos challenge: Action recognition with a large number of classes*. 2014.

- For **ActivityNet-1.3**, the citation is:
  > Fabian Caba Heilbron, Victor Escorcia, Bernard Ghanem, and Juan Carlos Niebles. *Activitynet: A large-scale video benchmark for human activity understanding*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 961â€“970, 2015.

Having gathered all the necessary information, I will now compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes its full citation. This will prepare the information for structured output or further processing.
