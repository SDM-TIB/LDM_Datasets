To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Attitudes toward Open Access, Open Peer Review, and Altmetrics among Contributors to Spanish Scholarly Journals" by Francisco Segado-Boj et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, results, and discussion sections** to look for any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's purpose and methodology, which may hint at the data collection process.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the context of the study and the significance of the survey conducted among contributors to Spanish academic journals. This section may not explicitly mention datasets but will provide background information on the research focus.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, where the authors describe the survey they conducted. Here, they mention that they invited a sample of 1,254 contributors to participate in a survey, and the response rate was 24% (n = 295). This indicates that the dataset consists of survey responses from these participants. I will note the characteristics of the dataset, such as the number of respondents and the demographic information collected.

In the **results section**, the authors present various tables summarizing the survey responses. These tables contain valuable information about the participants' attitudes toward open access, open peer review, and altmetrics. I will extract the relevant data points from these tables, including the number of respondents for each question and their corresponding percentages.

Finally, I will check the **discussion section** for any additional insights or clarifications regarding the dataset. The authors may reflect on the implications of their findings, which could provide context for the dataset's significance.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the details of the dataset, including the following:

1. **Dataset Name**: Survey Dataset on Open Access, Open Peer Review, and Altmetrics.
2. **Description**: A dataset comprising responses from 295 contributors to Spanish scholarly journals regarding their attitudes toward open access, open peer review, and altmetrics.
3. **Citation**: Segado-Boj, F., Martín-Quevedo, J., & Prieto-Gutiérrez, J. J. (2018). Attitudes toward Open Access, Open Peer Review, and Altmetrics among Contributors to Spanish Scholarly Journals. *Journal of Scholarly Publishing*, 50(1), 48-70. https://doi.org/10.3138/jsp.50.1.08

With this structured approach, I will ensure that I accurately capture the dataset's details and provide the full citation as required. This will facilitate proper referencing and allow others to access the dataset for further research or analysis.
