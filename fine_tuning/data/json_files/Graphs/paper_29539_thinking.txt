To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Empirical Advocacy of Bio-inspired Models for Robust Image Recognition" by Harshitha Machiraju et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned or implied. The abstract discusses benchmarking the robustness of bio-inspired models, which suggests that datasets are involved, but I need to find specific names.

Next, I will look at the **experiments section** (Section 3) where the authors evaluate the robustness of bio-inspired models. In this section, they mention that the evaluation is performed on the **CIFAR-10 dataset** and **ImageNet-Val**. This indicates that these datasets are used for their experiments.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The CIFAR-10 dataset is a well-known dataset, and its citation is:

- For **CIFAR-10**:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. *CIFAR-10: The CIFAR-10 dataset of images*. 2009. [Link: https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html]

The ImageNet dataset is also widely recognized, and its citation is:

- For **ImageNet**:
  > Olga Russakovsky, Jia Deng, Hao Sheng, et al. *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 115(3):211-252, 2015. [Link: http://www.image-net.org/]

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing.

In summary, the datasets extracted from the paper are:
1. **CIFAR-10** - used for evaluating the robustness of bio-inspired models.
2. **ImageNet-Val** - also used for evaluating the robustness of the VOneNet model.

I will ensure that the full citations are included for each dataset as they are crucial for proper referencing.
