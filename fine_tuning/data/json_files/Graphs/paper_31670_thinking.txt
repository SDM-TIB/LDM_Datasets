To extract datasets from the research paper titled "EC2: Emergent Communication for Embodied Control" by Yao Mu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a high-level overview, and while it may not list datasets explicitly, it sets the context for the research. The introduction often elaborates on the methods and may reference datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, particularly **subsection 4.1 (Pre-training Dataset)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for training their model. Here, they mention the **LOReL dataset**, which is crucial for understanding their experimental setup. The authors provide specific details about this dataset, including the number of episodes, frames, and annotations, which are essential for a comprehensive description.

In addition to the LOReL dataset, I will also look for any other datasets mentioned in the paper, especially in the context of the downstream testing environments. The authors reference **MetaWorld** and **Franka Kitchen** as benchmarks for their experiments. I will need to confirm if these are datasets or environments and gather the necessary details.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is critical for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

1. **LOReL Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Suraj Nair, Eric Mitchell, Kevin Chen, Silvio Savarese, Chelsea Finn, et al. *Learning language-conditioned robot behavior from offline data and crowd-sourced annotation*. In Conference on Robot Learning, pages 1303–1315. PMLR, 2022.

2. **MetaWorld**: The citation is:
   > Tianhe Yu, Deirdre Quillen, Zhanpeng He, Ryan Julian, Karol Hausman, Chelsea Finn, and Sergey Levine. *MetaWorld: A benchmark and evaluation for multi-task and meta reinforcement learning*. In Conference on Robot Learning, pages 1094–1100. PMLR, 2020.

3. **Franka Kitchen**: The citation is:
   > Abhishek Gupta, Vikash Kumar, Corey Lynch, Sergey Levine, and Karol Hausman. *Relay policy learning: Solving long-horizon tasks via imitation and reinforcement learning*. In Conference on Robot Learning, 2019.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
