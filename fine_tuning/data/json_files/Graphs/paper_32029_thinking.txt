To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Event-Centric Query Expansion in Web Search" by Yanan Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the dataset and baseline codes are available at a specific URL, which indicates that there is a dataset associated with the research.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **methodology section**. In this paper, the authors describe the construction of a dataset called **Title2EventPhrase**, which is used for evaluating their event-centric query expansion system. I will note the details provided about this dataset, including its size, the number of topics, and the average lengths of titles and events.

In the **experiments section**, the authors discuss the performance of their system using this dataset, which further confirms its significance in their research. I will also check the **appendices** for any additional details or datasets that may not have been mentioned in the main text.

Now, I will gather the full citation for the **Title2EventPhrase dataset** from the references section. The relevant citation is:
> Haolin Deng, Yanan Zhang, Yangfan Zhang, Wangyang Ying, Changlong Yu, Jun Gao, Wei Wang, Xiaoling Bai, Nan Yang, Jin Ma, Xiang Chen, and Tianhua Zhou. *Title2Event: Benchmarking open event extraction with a large-scale Chinese title dataset*. In Proceedings of the 2022 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 6511â€“6524, Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. Association for Computational Linguistics.

After compiling this information, I will summarize the dataset details, including its purpose, size, and citation, ensuring that I adhere to the required format for clarity and completeness.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for **Title2EventPhrase** to ensure it is ready for any further processing or review.
