To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Context Matters: Pushing the Boundaries of Open-Ended Answer Generation with Graph-Structured Knowledge Context" by Somnath Banerjee et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and dataset sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the use of "domain-specific datasets from open-source CQA platforms," which indicates that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Dataset)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention three datasets:

1. **AskUbuntu**: This dataset consists of questions and answers from the AskUbuntu community, specifically targeting queries related to Ubuntu. The authors provide statistics about the dataset, including the number of training and test samples, the years of questions, and the average lengths of questions and answers.

2. **ServerFault**: Similar to AskUbuntu, this dataset is derived from the ServerFault community, focusing on server-related questions. The authors again provide detailed statistics about the dataset, including the number of training and test samples and their respective lengths.

3. **Unix**: This dataset is sourced from Unix-related questions and answers, with the authors providing comparable statistics to the other datasets.

In addition to the descriptions, I will also check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. However, since these datasets are derived from community question-answering platforms, they may not have formal citations like traditional datasets. Instead, I will note the platforms from which they originate.

The citations for the datasets will be as follows:

- For **AskUbuntu**:
  > AskUbuntu. (n.d.). Retrieved from https://askubuntu.com/

- For **ServerFault**:
  > ServerFault. (n.d.). Retrieved from https://serverfault.com/

- For **Unix**:
  > Unix. (n.d.). Retrieved from https://www.unix.com/

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the relevant details and citations for each dataset. This structured approach will help in accurately documenting the datasets used in the research paper.
