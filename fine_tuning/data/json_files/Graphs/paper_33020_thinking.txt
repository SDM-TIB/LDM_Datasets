To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Leveraging Multimodal Features and Item-level User Feedback for Bundle Construction" by Xiaohao Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments on **four datasets in two application domains**, which indicates that datasets are present.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors discuss the challenges of bundle construction and the need for high-quality datasets. They mention that they will evaluate their method on datasets related to fashion outfits and music playlists, which gives me a clue about the types of datasets I should look for.

In the **experiments section**, I will look for a subsection that details the datasets used. The authors provide a table (Table 1) that summarizes the statistics of the four datasets they used. The datasets mentioned are:

1. **POG**: A dataset for fashion outfit generation.
2. **POG_dense**: A denser version of the POG dataset.
3. **Spotify**: A dataset for music playlists.
4. **Spotify_sparse**: A sparser version of the Spotify dataset.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **POG**:
  > Wen Chen et al. "POG: Personalized Outfit Generation for Fashion Recommendation at Alibaba iFashion." In KDD, 2019.

- For **Spotify**:
  > Ching-Wei Chen et al. "RecSys Challenge 2018: Automatic Music Playlist Continuation." In RecSys, 2018.

Next, I will ensure that I have the correct details for each dataset, including the number of users, items, bundles, and interactions, as provided in Table 1 of the paper.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and that the full citations are included. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.

After completing this process, I will have a structured output ready for review or further processing.
