To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Coarse Graining Molecular Dynamics with Graph Neural Networks" by Brooke E. Husic et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study and may mention specific datasets used. The introduction often discusses the context and significance of the research, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets in the **methods section**, particularly where the authors describe their computational experiments or simulations. This section typically details the datasets used for training and validation of the models.

In the **results section**, I will check for any additional datasets that may have been generated or analyzed as part of the study. The authors may present results based on different datasets, including those derived from simulations or perturbations of existing datasets.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

From my reading, I expect to find at least two datasets mentioned in the paper:

1. **Capped Alanine Dataset**: This dataset is derived from an all-atom molecular dynamics simulation of capped alanine, which is commonly used in studies of protein dynamics. The citation for this dataset is:
   > K. Lindorff-Larsen, S. Piana, R. O. Dror, and D. E. Shaw. *How fast-folding proteins fold*. Science 334, 517–520 (2011).

2. **Chignolin Dataset**: This dataset is based on the CLN025 variant of chignolin, a small miniprotein. The citation for this dataset is:
   > S. Honda, T. Akiba, Y. S. Kato, Y. Sawada, M. Sekijima, and M. Ishimura. *Crystal structure of a ten-amino acid protein*. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 130, 15327–15331 (2008).

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will help in accurately documenting the datasets used in the research.
