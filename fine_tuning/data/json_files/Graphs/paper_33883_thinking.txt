To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Speaker-Independent Dysarthria Severity Classification using Self-Supervised Transformers and Multi-Task Learning" by Lauren Stumpf et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract mentions the evaluation on the **Universal Access Speech dataset**, which indicates that this dataset is crucial for the study.

Next, I will examine the **Materials and Methods** section, specifically the **Dataset** subsection, where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset used. Here, they describe the **Universal Access dysarthric speech corpus (UA-Speech)**, noting that it includes recordings from 15 subjects with dysarthria and 13 age-matched healthy controls. The dataset comprises various spoken words and provides both word-level and phoneme-level transcriptions, which are essential for their research methodology.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the **UA-Speech dataset**. The paper cites the dataset as follows:

- **Universal Access Speech dataset**:
  > Kim H, Hasegawa-Johnson M, Perlman A, Gunderson J, Huang TS, Watkin K, et al. *Dysarthric speech database for universal access research*. In: Ninth Annual Conference of the International Speech Communication Association; 2008.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets, I will conclude my extraction process here.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the dataset as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the dataset utilized in the research.
