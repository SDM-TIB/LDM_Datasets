To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Interference Prediction in Wireless Networks: Stochastic Geometry meets Recursive Filtering" by Jorge F. Schmidt et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses a technique for predicting interference in wireless networks, but it does not specify any datasets at this point.

Next, I will examine the **introduction section** more closely. Here, the authors discuss the importance of interference management in wireless systems but do not mention specific datasets. I will continue to the **methodology and experiments sections** to look for any datasets used for evaluation or validation of their proposed technique.

In the **experiments section**, the authors describe various numerical examples and scenarios but do not provide specific dataset names. They mention using simulations based on stochastic geometry models, which implies that they may have generated their own datasets rather than using publicly available ones.

Since the paper does not explicitly mention any datasets, I will check the **references section** to see if any cited works include datasets that could be relevant to the research. However, the references primarily consist of theoretical works and previous studies on interference modeling and stochastic geometry, rather than datasets.

After reviewing the entire paper, it appears that the authors did not utilize any specific datasets from external sources for their experiments. Instead, they relied on simulations based on theoretical models. Therefore, I will note that no datasets were extracted from this paper.

In conclusion, I will summarize my findings and document that the paper does not provide any datasets, and thus, there are no citations to include for datasets. This will be important for future reference and for anyone looking for datasets related to this research topic.
