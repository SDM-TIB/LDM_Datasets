To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "Leveraging Unlabeled Data for 3D Medical Image Segmentation Through Self-Supervised Contrastive Learning" by Sanaz Karimijafarbigloo et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments for organ segmentation using clinical MRI and CT scans, which suggests that specific datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 3.2 (Dataset)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention two datasets:

1. **Left Atrial Dataset (LA)**: This dataset consists of 1003 3D gadolinium-enhanced MR imaging volumes with manual left atrial annotations. The authors provide details about the resolution and preprocessing steps, which are crucial for understanding the dataset's characteristics.

2. **NIH Pancreas Dataset**: This dataset includes 82 abdominal CT volumes with manual pancreas annotations. The authors also describe the dimensions of the CT volumes and the preprocessing methods applied, which are important for replicating their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Left Atrial Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Zhaohan Xiong, Qing Xia, Zhiqiang Hu, Ning Huang, Cheng Bian, Yefeng Zheng, Sulaiman Vesal, Nishant Ravikumar, Andreas Maier, Xin Yang, et al. "A global benchmark of algorithms for segmenting the left atrium from late gadolinium-enhanced cardiac magnetic resonance imaging." *Medical image analysis*, vol. 67, pp. 101832, 2021.

- For the **NIH Pancreas Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Holger R Roth, Le Lu, Amal Farag, Hoo-Chang Shin, Jiamin Liu, Evrim B Turkbey, and Ronald M Summers. "Deeporgan: Multi-level deep convolutional networks for automated pancreas segmentation." In *MICCAI 2015*. Springer, 2015, pp. 556â€“564.

Having gathered the necessary information, I will now compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will be crucial for any further analysis or replication of the study.
