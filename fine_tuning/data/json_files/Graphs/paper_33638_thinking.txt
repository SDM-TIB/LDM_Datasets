To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CONFIT: Improving Resume-Job Matching using Data Augmentation and Contrastive Learning" by Jinzhong Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the datasets used. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their method on "two real-world datasets," which indicates that specific datasets will be discussed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In **section 4.1 (Dataset and Preprocessing)**, the authors explicitly mention two datasets:

1. **AliYun Dataset**: This dataset is derived from the 2019 Alibaba job-resume intelligent matching competition. It contains desensitized resume-job pairs parsed into various text fields. The authors note that all resumes and jobs are in Chinese.

2. **Intellipro Dataset**: This dataset consists of resumes and job posts collected from Intellipro Group Inc. It has been anonymized to protect candidate privacy and includes both English and Chinese resumes and jobs.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. However, since the AliYun dataset is noted to be no longer publicly available, I will document that fact as part of the dataset description.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **AliYun Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Alibaba Group. *2019 Alibaba Job-Resume Intelligent Matching Competition*. [Link to competition page](https://tianchi.aliyun.com/competition/entrance/231728) (Note: Dataset is no longer publicly available as of 09-11-2023).

- For the **Intellipro Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Intellipro Group Inc. *Internal dataset for resume-job matching*. (No formal publication available).

Now, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and citations, ensuring that I provide clear and accurate information for each dataset.
