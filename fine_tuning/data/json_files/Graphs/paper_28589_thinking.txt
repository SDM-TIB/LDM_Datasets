To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Interpretability Aware Model Training to Improve Robustness against Out-of-Distribution Magnetic Resonance Images in Alzheimer’s Disease Classification" by Merel Kuijs et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors applied their method to MRI images from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database, which suggests that this is a key dataset.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **Methods section**. In section 3.1, the authors explicitly state that they tested their approach on structural, T1-weighted MR images of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and cognitive normal (CN) subjects from the ADNI database. They mention using images from both 1.5T and 3T scanners, with specific counts of subjects for each type (n=358 for 1.5T and n=247 for 3T). This confirms that the ADNI dataset is central to their experiments.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the ADNI dataset. The relevant citation is:

> Clifford R. Jack, Matt A. Bernstein, Nick C. Fox, Paul Thompson, Gene Alexander, Danielle Harvey, Bret Borowski, Paula J. Britson, Jennifer L. Whitwell, Chadwick Ward, et al. *The Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI): MRI methods*. Journal of Magnetic Resonance Imaging: An Official Journal of the International Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine, 27(4):685–691, 2008.

Since the authors did not mention any other datasets, I will compile the information regarding the ADNI dataset into a structured format.

Finally, I will ensure that the dataset entry is complete with the necessary details, including the dataset name, description, and full citation, ready for downstream processing.
