To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "Phrase Retrieval for Open-Domain Conversational Question Answering with Conversational Dependency Modeling via Contrastive Learning" by Soyeong Jeong et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors validate their model on two ODConvQA datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experimental Setups)**, particularly **subsection 4.1 (Datasets and Metrics)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they identify two datasets:

1. **OR-QuAC**: This dataset is described as a benchmark for ODConvQA, extending the QuAC dataset to an open-retrieval setting. It consists of 35,526 conversational turns for training, 3,430 for validation, and 5,571 for testing.

2. **TopiOCQA**: This dataset is noted for addressing the topic-switching problem in conversations. It contains 45,450 conversational turns, with 2,514 turns allocated for training and validation.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **OR-QuAC**, the citation is:
  > Qu, C., Yang, L., Chen, C., Qiu, M., Croft, W. B., & Iyyer, M. (2020). Open-retrieval conversational question answering. In Proceedings of the 43rd International ACM SIGIR conference on research and development in Information Retrieval (SIGIR 2020), pages 539–548. ACM.

- For **TopiOCQA**, the citation is:
  > Adlakha, V., Dhuliawala, S., Suleman, K., de Vries, H., & Reddy, S. (2022). TopiOCQA: Open-domain conversational question answering with topic switching. Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics, 10, 468–483.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations.
