To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Aligning Step-by-Step Instructional Diagrams to Video Demonstrations" by Jiahao Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant details, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract introduces a new dataset called **IAW (Ikea Assembly in the Wild)**, which consists of videos and illustrations related to furniture assembly. This is a strong indication that I need to gather more details about this dataset.

Next, I will look into **section 4 (Ikea Assembly in the Wild Dataset)**, where the authors provide a comprehensive description of the IAW dataset. Here, I will note the key characteristics of the dataset, including:

1. **Content**: The dataset contains 1,005 videos of furniture assembly, totaling approximately 183 hours of footage, and nearly 8,300 instructional diagrams from 420 unique furniture types.
2. **Annotations**: The dataset includes ground truth alignments obtained via Amazon Mechanical Turk, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's usability in research.
3. **Tasks**: The authors define two tasks for evaluation: nearest neighbor retrieval between video segments and instructional diagrams, and alignment of instruction steps to video segments.

After gathering this information, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the IAW dataset. The authors do not provide a separate citation for the dataset itself, but they reference their own work in the paper, which serves as the authoritative source for the dataset.

The citation for the IAW dataset is:
> Jiahao Zhang, Anoop Cherian, Yanbin Liu, Yizhak Ben-Shabat, Cristian Rodriguez, Stephen Gould. *Aligning Step-by-Step Instructional Diagrams to Video Demonstrations*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2023.

Now, I will compile the extracted information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and citation. This will allow for easy reference and further analysis.

In summary, I will focus on the following steps:
1. Identify the dataset in the abstract and introduction.
2. Gather detailed information from the dataset section.
3. Retrieve the full citation from the references.
4. Compile the information for clarity and future use.
