To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Space Engage: Collaborative Space Supervision for Contrastive-based Semi-Supervised Semantic Segmentation" by Changqi Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of the proposed method on two public benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved. 

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In **Section 4.1 (Setup)**, the authors explicitly mention two datasets:

1. **PASCAL VOC 2012**: This dataset is noted for containing 1,464 labeled images in the training set and 1,449 images in the validation set. The authors also mention that they augment this dataset with additional images from the SBD dataset, which contains 9,118 images.

2. **Cityscapes**: This dataset is described as containing 2,975 images in the training set and 500 images in the validation set, specifically designed for urban scene understanding.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **PASCAL VOC 2012**, the citation is:
  > Mark Everingham, Luc Van Gool, Christopher KI Williams, John Winn, and Andrew Zisserman. *The PASCAL Visual Object Classes (VOC) Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 88(2):303–338, 2010.

- For **Cityscapes**, the citation is:
  > Marius Cordts, Mohamed Omran, Sebastian Ramos, Timo Rehfeld, Markus Enzweiler, Rodrigo Benenson, Uwe Franke, Stefan Roth, and Bernt Schiele. *The Cityscapes Dataset for Semantic Urban Scene Understanding*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 3213–3223, 2016.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their respective citations.
