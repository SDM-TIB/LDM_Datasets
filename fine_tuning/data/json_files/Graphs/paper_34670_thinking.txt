To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CHARME: A chain-based reinforcement learning approach for the minor embedding problem" by Hoang M. Ngo et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for experiments. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically looking for any subsections that detail the datasets used. In this paper, the authors mention two types of datasets: **synthetic datasets** generated using the Barabási-Albert model and **real datasets** derived from the QUBO formulations of the Target Identification by Enzymes (TIE) problem.

In the **experiments section**, I will note the specific details about each dataset:

1. **Synthetic Dataset**: The authors describe a training set consisting of 700 Barabási-Albert graphs with 150 nodes and a degree of 10, and a testing set of 300 new graphs with varying nodes and degrees.

2. **Real Dataset**: This dataset is generated from 105 metabolic networks sourced from the KEGG database, with logical graphs ranging from 6 to 165 nodes and 22 to 578 edges. The dataset is divided into three groups based on density.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** for any citations related to the datasets. In this case, the authors reference the KEGG database for the real dataset, which is crucial for proper citation.

The full citation for the KEGG database is:
> Minoru Kanehisa and Susumu Goto. 2000. KEGG: Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes. Nucleic Acids Research 28, 1 (2000), 27–30. https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/28.1.27

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required.

In summary, I will extract the following datasets:
1. **Synthetic Dataset**: 700 Barabási-Albert graphs (training) and 300 graphs (testing).
2. **Real Dataset**: 105 metabolic networks from the KEGG database.

Finally, I will ensure that all extracted datasets are accompanied by their respective citations for clarity and proper referencing.
