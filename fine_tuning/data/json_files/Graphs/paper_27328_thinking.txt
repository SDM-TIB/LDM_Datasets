To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Chickenpox Cases in Hungary: a Benchmark Dataset for Spatiotemporal Signal Processing with Graph Neural Networks" by Benedek Rozemberczki et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors propose the **Chickenpox Cases in Hungary dataset** as a new dataset for comparing graph neural network architectures. This indicates that there is a specific dataset to focus on.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for further details about the dataset. The introduction emphasizes the need for real-world problems to test forecasting performance, and it mentions the release of the Chickenpox Cases in Hungary dataset, confirming its significance.

I will then look into **section 3 (Characteristics of the Dataset)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the dataset. They explain that it consists of a multivariate time series of weekly reported chickenpox cases in Hungarian counties, covering the period from January 2005 to January 2015. This section also discusses the dataset's structure, including the number of entries and the spatial graph representing county connectivity.

In **section 4 (Modeling Challenges)**, the authors outline various challenges posed by the dataset, which further emphasizes its complexity and relevance for benchmarking.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The citation provided in the ACM Reference Format is as follows:
> Benedek Rozemberczki, Paul Scherer, Oliver Kiss, Rik Sarkar, and Tamas Ferenci. 2021. Chickenpox Cases in Hungary: a Benchmark Dataset for Spatiotemporal Signal Processing with Graph Neural Networks. In WWWâ€™21: Graph Learning Benchmarks Workshop, 2021, Ljubljana, SL. ACM, New York, NY, USA, 4 pages. https://doi.org/10.1145/nnnnnnn.nnnnnnn

Having gathered all the necessary information, I will now compile the dataset entry, ensuring that I include the full citation as it is crucial for proper attribution. The dataset entry will highlight the dataset's name, description, and citation, ready for further processing or review.
