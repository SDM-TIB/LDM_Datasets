To extract datasets from the research paper titled "PartCom: Part Composition Learning for 3D Open-Set Recognition" by Tingyu Weng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions conducting experiments on "three kinds of 3D OSR tasks based on both CAD shape dataset and scan shape dataset." This indicates that there are datasets involved, but I need to find their specific names and details.

Next, I will look into **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe the evaluation datasets for 3D OSR. Here, they explicitly mention three datasets used for evaluation:

1. **ModelNet40**: A widely used dataset for 3D object recognition that contains 40 categories of 3D shapes. It is commonly used in various 3D recognition tasks.

2. **ShapeNetCore**: Another popular dataset that provides a rich collection of 3D models across various categories, which is often utilized for training and evaluating 3D recognition algorithms.

3. **ScanObjectNN**: A dataset designed for 3D object recognition that includes real-world scans of objects, providing a challenging benchmark for evaluating 3D recognition methods.

In the same section, the authors describe how they construct various 3D OSR tasks based on these datasets, confirming their use in the experiments.

Now, I will refer to the **References section** to gather the full citations for these datasets:

- For **ModelNet40**, the citation is:
  > Wu, Zhirong, et al. "3D ShapeNets: A Deep Representation for Volumetric Shapes." In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 1912–1920, 2015.

- For **ShapeNetCore**, the citation is:
  > Chang, Angel X., et al. "ShapeNet: An Information-Rich 3D Model Repository." arXiv preprint arXiv:1512.03012, 2015.

- For **ScanObjectNN**, the citation is:
  > Uy, Mikaela Angelina, et al. "Revisiting Point Cloud Classification: A New Benchmark Dataset and Classification Model on Real-World Data." In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 1588–1597, 2019.

With these citations in hand, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, which is crucial for reproducibility and further research.
