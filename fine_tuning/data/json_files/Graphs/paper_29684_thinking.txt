To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Neuro CROSS exchange: Learning to CROSS exchange to solve realistic vehicle routing problems" by Minjun Kim et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to find any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the proposed method, Neuro CE (NCE), is evaluated on various vehicle routing problems (VRPs), which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for training and evaluation. In this paper, the authors mention generating **50,000 random FMDVRP instances** for training the cost-decrement prediction model. This indicates that the FMDVRP dataset is a primary dataset used in their experiments.

I will also check the **appendices** for any additional details about the datasets. The paper includes a section on **dataset preparation** where it describes how the random FMDVRP instances are generated, including the parameters for the number of customers, depots, and the coordinates of the cities. This further confirms that the FMDVRP dataset is central to their research.

Now, I will look for full citations for the datasets mentioned. Since the FMDVRP dataset is generated by the authors and does not have a formal citation, I will note that it is a synthetic dataset created for the purpose of this research. However, I will also check if there are any references to existing datasets or benchmarks in the related works or references section.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries. The key dataset identified is:

1. **FMDVRP Dataset**: A synthetic dataset generated by the authors, consisting of 50,000 random instances of the flexible multi-depot vehicle routing problem (FMDVRP). The instances are created by sampling the number of customers and depots, as well as their coordinates.

Since there are no formal citations for the FMDVRP dataset, I will note that it is a dataset created specifically for this study.

Finally, I will summarize the findings and prepare the dataset entry for review or further processing.
