To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Multi-level Supervised Contrastive Learning Framework for Low-Resource Natural Language Inference" by Shu’ang Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on **two public NLI datasets in low-resource settings**, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **Section IV (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors provide a benchmark dataset for their experiments. Here, they mention three datasets:

1. **Stanford Natural Language Inference (SNLI)**: This dataset contains 570,000 human-annotated sentence pairs, where the premises are drawn from the captions of the Flickr30 corpus and hypotheses are manually annotated.

2. **Multi-Genre NLI Corpus (MultiNLI)**: This corpus consists of 433,000 sentence pairs, each labeled with one of the relationships: entailment, contradiction, or neutral.

3. **SICK (Sentences Involving Compositional Knowledge)**: This dataset contains around 10,000 English sentence pairs, each annotated for relatedness in meaning.

Additionally, the authors mention the **SciTail** dataset, which is derived from a science question answering dataset and is used for domain adaptation in their study.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **SNLI**, the citation is:
  > Sam Bowman, Gabor Angeli, Christopher Potts, and Christopher D. Manning. *A large annotated corpus for learning natural language inference*. In Proceedings of the 2015 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), pages 632–642, 2015.

- For **MultiNLI**, the citation is:

- For **SICK**, the citation is:
  > Marco Marelli, Simone Menini, Marco Baroni, Laura Bentivogli, Roberto Bernardi, and Roberto Zamparelli. *A sick cure for the evaluation of compositional distributional semantic models*.

- For **SciTail**, the citation is:
  > Tushar Khot, Ashish Sabharwal, and Peter Clark. *SciTail: A textual entailment dataset from science question answering*. In Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, vol. 32, no. 1, 2018.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and cited according to the requirements. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
