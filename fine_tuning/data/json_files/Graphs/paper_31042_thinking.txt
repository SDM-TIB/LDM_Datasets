To extract datasets from the research paper titled "JCSE: Contrastive Learning of Japanese Sentence Embeddings and Its Applications" by Zihao Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract highlights the construction of a **comprehensive Japanese STS (Semantic Textual Similarity) benchmark** and a **new human-annotated QAbot dataset**, indicating that these are significant datasets used in the research.

Next, I will delve into **section 1 (Introduction)**, where the authors discuss the lack of benchmark datasets for Japanese STS and mention the JSNLI dataset, which is translated from the SNLI dataset. This section provides context for the datasets used in their experiments.

In **section 4 (Experiments)**, the authors detail the datasets they constructed and utilized. Here are the key datasets identified:

1. **Japanese STS Benchmark**: This benchmark combines several datasets, including:
   - **JSICK Dataset**: A manually created dataset based on the SICK dataset.
   - **JSTS Dataset**: A dataset created for Japanese STS tasks.
   - Translated versions of the **STS12-16** and **STS-B** datasets from English to Japanese.

2. **JACSTS Dataset**: A dataset specifically for sentence-level clinical STS, consisting of 3,670 sentence pairs annotated for similarity.

3. **QAbot Dataset**: A dataset collected from question-answer dialogues in educational courses, containing 1,142 question-answer pairs.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **JSICK Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Hitomi Yanaka and Koji Mineshima. *Compositional Evaluation on Japanese Textual Entailment and Similarity*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2208.04826, 2022.

- For the **JSTS Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Kentaro Kurihara, Daisuke Kawahara, and Tomohide Shibata. *JGLUE: Japanese General Language Understanding Evaluation*. Proceedings of the Thirteenth Language Resources and Evaluation Conference, 2022.

- For the **JACSTS Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Faith Wavinya Mutinda, et al. *Semantic textual similarity in Japanese clinical domain texts using BERT*. Methods of Information in Medicine, 60.S 01 (2021): e56-e64.

- For the **QAbot Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Zihao Chen, Hisashi Handa, and Kimiaki Shirahama. *JCSE: Contrastive Learning of Japanese Sentence Embeddings and Its Applications*. GitHub repository, 2023.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented and properly cited.
