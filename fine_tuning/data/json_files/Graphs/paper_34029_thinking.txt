To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Knowledge-Enhanced Recommendation with User-Centric Subgraph Network" by Guangyi Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to find any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the proposed method achieves accurate recommendations and that experimental results demonstrate its superiority over state-of-the-art methods, which suggests that datasets were used for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly the part where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention using three benchmark datasets for recommendation tasks: **Last-FM**, **Amazon-Book**, and **Alibaba-iFashion**. Each dataset is described with specific statistics, such as the number of users, items, interactions, entities, relations, and triplets.

I will extract the relevant details for each dataset:

1. **Last-FM**: 
   - Users: 23,566
   - Items: 48,123
   - Interactions: 3,034,796
   - Entities: 58,266
   - Relations: 9
   - Triplets: 464,567

2. **Amazon-Book**: 
   - Users: 70,679
   - Items: 24,915
   - Interactions: 847,733
   - Entities: 88,572
   - Relations: 39
   - Triplets: 2,557,746

3. **Alibaba-iFashion**: 
   - Users: 114,737
   - Items: 30,040
   - Interactions: 1,781,093
   - Entities: 59,156
   - Relations: 51
   - Triplets: 279,155

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for these datasets. However, the paper does not provide specific citations for the datasets themselves, as they are commonly used benchmark datasets in the field of recommendation systems.

For the purpose of documentation, I will note that the datasets are widely recognized in the research community and can be referenced as follows:

- **Last-FM**: 
  > Last.fm dataset. Available at: https://www.last.fm/api
- **Amazon-Book**: 
  > Amazon Product Review Dataset. Available at: https://registry.opendata.aws/amazon-reviews/
- **Alibaba-iFashion**: 
  > Alibaba iFashion dataset. Available at: https://tianchi.aliyun.com/dataset/dataDetail?dataId=56

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective details and citations into a structured format for further processing or review.
