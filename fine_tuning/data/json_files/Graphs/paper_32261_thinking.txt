To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Graph Convolutional Networks for Simulating Multi-phase Flow and Transport in Porous Media" by Jiamin Jiang and Bo Guo, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to look for any references to datasets. The abstract discusses the use of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) for simulating multi-phase flow, which suggests that there may be datasets involved in the training and evaluation of these models.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments and results sections** to find specific mentions of datasets used for training or testing the models. In the introduction, the authors mention the need for data-driven surrogate models, which indicates that they likely utilized specific datasets for their experiments.

Upon reviewing the **experiments section**, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics. The authors may describe the datasets used for training the GCN models, such as the number of simulation runs or the types of properties included in the datasets.

I will also check the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

For example, if the authors mention a dataset like "180 high-fidelity simulation runs" or "2D heterogeneous test cases," I will note these details and look for any associated publications or sources that provide a full citation for these datasets.

Once I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described with its full citation included.

Finally, I will summarize the findings, ensuring that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research, along with their respective citations, to facilitate further research or validation by others in the field.
