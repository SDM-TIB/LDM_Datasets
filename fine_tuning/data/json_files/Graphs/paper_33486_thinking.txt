To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The Power of Training: How Different Neural Network Setups Influence the Energy Demand" by Daniel Geißler et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to locate any references to datasets. In the abstract, the authors discuss evaluating energy consumption across different training setups, which suggests that datasets are involved, but I need to find specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly the subsection titled "Experiment Setup." Here, the authors explicitly mention two datasets used in their experiments:

1. **CelebA Dataset**: This dataset is used for a computer vision task involving facial attribute classification. It is a well-known dataset in the field of image processing.

2. **PAMAP2 Dataset**: This dataset is utilized for sensor-based activity recognition. It is commonly used in studies related to human activity recognition.

I will also check the **results section** to confirm that these datasets were indeed used in the experiments and to gather any additional details about their application.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **CelebA Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Liu, Z., Luo, P., Wang, X., Tang, X. (2015). *Deep learning face attributes in the wild*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), December 2015.

- For the **PAMAP2 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Reiss, A., Stricker, D. (2012). *Introducing a new benchmarked dataset for activity monitoring*. In 2012 16th International Symposium on Wearable Computers, pp. 108–109. IEEE.

Now that I have the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their respective references.
