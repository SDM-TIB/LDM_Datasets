To extract datasets from the research paper titled "JuryGCN: Quantifying Jackknife Uncertainty on Graph Convolutional Networks" by Jian Kang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors perform extensive experimental evaluation on real-world datasets, which suggests that datasets are indeed used. I will look for specific names or descriptions of these datasets.

Next, I will carefully read through the **experiments section** (which is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets used). In this section, the authors typically describe the datasets, including their characteristics and how they are utilized in the experiments. 

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention four widely used benchmark datasets: **Cora**, **Citeseer**, **Pubmed**, and **Reddit**. I will note down the details provided for each dataset, including the number of nodes, edges, features, and classes, as this information is crucial for a comprehensive dataset description.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. This is important because proper attribution is necessary for academic integrity. 

The citations I will extract for each dataset are as follows:

1. **Cora Dataset**: 
   > Sen, P., Namata, G., Bilgic, M., Getoor, L., Galligher, B., & Eliassi-Rad, T. (2008). Collective Classification in Network Data. *AI Magazine*, 29(3), 93-106.

2. **Citeseer Dataset**: 
   > Sen, P., Namata, G., Bilgic, M., Getoor, L., Galligher, B., & Eliassi-Rad, T. (2008). Collective Classification in Network Data. *AI Magazine*, 29(3), 93-106.

3. **Pubmed Dataset**: 
   > Namata, G., London, B., Getoor, L., Huang, B., & Eliassi-Rad, T. (2012). Query-Driven Active Surveying for Collective Classification. In *Proceedings of the 2012 ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining* (pp. 1-9).

4. **Reddit Dataset**: 
   > Hamilton, W. L., Ying, R., & Leskovec, J. (2017). Inductive Representation Learning on Large Graphs. In *Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems* (pp. 1025-1035).

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This structured approach will help me accurately extract and present the datasets used in the research paper.
