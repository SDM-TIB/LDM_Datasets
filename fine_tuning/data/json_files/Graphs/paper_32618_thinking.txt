To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Long-Tail Friendly Representation Framework for Artist and Music Similarity" by Haoran Xiang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on the **AllMusic dataset**, which suggests that this dataset is central to their research.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 3), where the authors provide detailed information about the datasets used. They mention building a **multi-source dataset** that includes artist/music metadata, artist music data, relationship data, and user-interaction data. This section specifies that the dataset comprises:

1. **Multi-source artist dataset**: This dataset includes 9,627 artists, with a breakdown of training, validation, and test sets. It highlights that 36.97% of the artists are long-tail artists.

2. **User-artist interaction dataset**: This dataset consists of 6.8 million data points, with 65,574 similarity relationships in the artist relationship data.

3. **Music similarity dataset**: This dataset includes 61,584 pieces of music with 82,880 music similarity relationships, where 53.06% of the music is classified as long-tail.

The authors also mention that the datasets were collected from **AllMusic**, which is crucial for citation purposes.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the AllMusic dataset. However, since AllMusic is a website and not a traditional dataset with a formal citation, I will note it as follows:

- **AllMusic dataset**: 
  > AllMusic. Available at: https://www.allmusic.com/

With this information, I will summarize the datasets extracted from the paper:

1. **Multi-source artist dataset**: Contains 9,627 artists, with training, validation, and test splits, including long-tail artists.
2. **User-artist interaction dataset**: Comprises 6.8 million interactions and 65,574 similarity relationships.
3. **Music similarity dataset**: Includes 61,584 pieces of music and 82,880 similarity relationships.

Finally, I will compile these datasets into a structured format for further processing, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited.
