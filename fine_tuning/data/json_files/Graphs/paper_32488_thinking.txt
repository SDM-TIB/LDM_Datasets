To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Combating Label Noise for Lung Nodule Malignancy Grading" by Xianze Ai et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that experiments were conducted on the **LIDC-IDRI dataset**, which suggests that this dataset is crucial for the research.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In the **experiments section**, the authors explicitly state that they used the **LIDC-IDRI dataset** for their study. This dataset is described as containing 2568 lung nodules from 1018 chest CT scans, with annotations provided by multiple annotators.

I will also check the **results section** to see if there are any additional datasets mentioned or if the LIDC-IDRI dataset is discussed in more detail. The results section confirms that the LIDC-IDRI dataset is the primary dataset used for evaluation, and it provides a breakdown of the malignancy distribution in the training and test sets.

Now, I will consult the **references section** to find the full citation for the LIDC-IDRI dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Armato III, S.G., McLennan, G., Bidaut, L., McNitt-Gray, M.F., Meyer, C.R., Reeves, A.P., Zhao, B., Aberle, D.R., Henschke, C.I., Hoffman, E.A., et al. "The lung image database consortium (lidc) and image database resource initiative (idri): a completed reference database of lung nodules on ct scans." *Medical Physics* 38(2), 915â€“931 (2011).

Since the paper primarily focuses on the LIDC-IDRI dataset, I will create an entry for this dataset, ensuring to include the full citation.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format that is ready for review or further processing.
