To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Representations with Contrastive Self-Supervised Learning for Histopathology Applications" by Karin Stacke et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments using multiple datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Method)**, particularly **subsection 4.2 (Datasets)**, where the authors describe the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention three different histopathology datasets:

1. **Camelyon16**: This dataset consists of 399 H&E-stained whole-slide images of sentinel lymph node tissue, annotated for breast cancer metastases. The authors explain how they sampled this dataset into smaller patches for both unsupervised and supervised training.

2. **AIDA-LNSK**: This dataset contains 96 whole-slide images from 71 unique patients of skin tissue. The authors detail how they split this dataset into training, validation, and test sets based on patient levels.

3. **Multidata**: This dataset is constructed from samples of 60 publicly available datasets, originating from various tissue types. The authors clarify that this dataset is used for self-supervised training only.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:

- For **Camelyon16**, the citation is:
  > Geert Litjens, Thijs Kooi, Babak Ehteshami Bejnordi, Arnaud Arindra Adiyoso Setio, Francesco Ciompi, Mohsen Ghafoorian, Jeroen A. W. M. van der Laak, Bram van Ginneken, and Clara I. Sánchez. *A Survey on Deep Learning in Medical Image Analysis*. Medical Image Analysis, 42:60–88, 2017.

- For **AIDA-LNSK**, the citation is:
  > Karin Lindman, F. Rose Jerónimo, Martin Lindvall, and Caroline Bivik Stadler. *Skin data from the Visual Sweden project DROID*. 2019.

- For **Multidata**, the citation is:
  > Ozan Ciga, Tony Xu, and Anne Louise Martel. *Self supervised contrastive learning for digital histopathology*. Machine Learning with Applications, 7:100198, 2022.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the study along with their proper citations.
