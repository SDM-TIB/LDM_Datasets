To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Deep Learning-aided Wireless Channel Estimation and Channel State Information Feedback for 6G" by Wonjun Kim et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a high-level overview, and the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the datasets used in the research.

Next, I will focus on **Section III (Learning Techniques for DL-based Wireless Channel Estimation and Exploitation)** and **Section IV (DL-aided Channel Estimation and Exploitation)**, as these sections are likely to contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used for training and evaluation. I will look for any specific datasets mentioned, including their characteristics and how they were utilized in the experiments.

In **Section III.A (Training Dataset Acquisition)**, the authors discuss three options for acquiring training datasets: collecting actual received signals, generating synthetic data using analytic models, and using generative adversarial networks (GANs). They mention the **Extended Pedestrian A (EPA) channel** and **Extended Vehicular A (EVA) channel** as examples of analytic models used for synthetic data generation. This indicates that these channels are part of the datasets used in their experiments.

In **Section IV**, the authors describe various case studies and numerical experiments, but they do not explicitly name additional datasets. However, they do reference the use of **real measured datasets** and datasets generated from GANs, which are crucial for their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The citations for the EPA and EVA channels are typically found in standards or technical reports, so I will look for those references.

1. **Extended Pedestrian A (EPA) channel**:
   > 3GPP TS 36.104. “Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access (E-UTRA); Base Station (BS) Radio Transmission and Reception,” 3rd Generation Partnership Project; Technical Specification Group Radio Access Network.

2. **Extended Vehicular A (EVA) channel**:
   > 3GPP TR 36.873. “Study on channel model for frequencies from 0.5 to 100 GHz,” 3rd Generation Partnership Project; Technical Specification Group Radio Access Network.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and includes the full citation as required. This structured approach will help ensure that I accurately capture all relevant datasets from the paper.
