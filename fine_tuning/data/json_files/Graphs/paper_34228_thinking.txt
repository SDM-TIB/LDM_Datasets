To extract datasets from the research paper titled "RoNID: New Intent Discovery with Generated-Reliable Labels and Cluster-friendly Representations" by Jian Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, but the introduction and experiments sections are likely to contain more detailed information about the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of New Intent Discovery (NID) and mention the need for datasets that can help in evaluating their proposed method. However, they do not specify any datasets at this point.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly **section 3 (Experiments)**, where the authors provide statistics for three public datasets used in their evaluations. The datasets mentioned are:

1. **CLINC**: An out-of-scope intent classification dataset with 150 classes across 10 domains. The authors note that they only utilize the in-scope queries for evaluation.

2. **BANKING**: A dataset comprising customer service queries from the banking domain, containing 77 classes.

3. **StackOverflow**: A dataset that includes technical question titles, with a curated version used in this work.

The authors also provide a table (Table 1) with detailed statistics for each dataset, including the number of classes, training, validation, and testing samples, as well as vocabulary size and length statistics.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

- For **CLINC**, the citation is:
  > Larson, S., Mahendran, A., Peper, J.J., Clarke, C., Lee, A., Hill, P., Kummerfeld, J.K., Leach, K., Laurenzano, M.A., Tang, L., et al. *An evaluation dataset for intent classification and out-of-scope prediction*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1909.02027, 2019.

- For **BANKING**, the citation is:
  > Casanueva, I., Temčinas, T., Gerz, D., Henderson, M., Vulić, I. *Efficient intent detection with dual sentence encoders*. In Proceedings of the 2nd Workshop on Natural Language Processing for Conversational AI, 2020.

- For **StackOverflow**, the citation is:
  > Xu, J., Wang, P., Tian, G., Xu, B., Zhao, J., Wang, F., Hao, H. *Short text clustering via convolutional neural networks*. In Proceedings of the 1st Workshop on Vector Space Modeling for Natural Language Processing, 2015.

With the datasets identified and their citations retrieved, I will now compile this information into a structured format for further use or processing.
