To extract datasets from the research paper titled "M2HGCL: Multi-Scale Meta-Path Integrated Heterogeneous Graph Contrastive Learning" by Yuanyuan Guo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors conducted experiments on three real-world datasets, which indicates that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experiment)**, where the authors provide a summary of the datasets used. In this section, they mention three datasets: **AMiner**, **ACM**, and **Freebase**. I will take note of the details provided for each dataset, including the types of nodes and the number of classes.

I will then look for the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. The relevant citations are:

- For **AMiner**, the citation is:
  > Hu, B., Fang, Y., Shi, C. (2019). Adversarial learning on heterogeneous information networks. In Proceedings of the 25th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery & Data Mining. pp. 120–129.

- For **ACM**, the citation is:
  > Zhao, J., Wang, X., Shi, C., Liu, Z., Ye, Y. (2020). Network schema preserving heterogeneous information network embedding. In Proceedings of the 29th International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence. pp. 1366–1372.

- For **Freebase**, the citation is:
  > Li, X., Ding, D., Kao, B., Sun, Y., Mamoulis, N. (2021). Leveraging meta-path contexts for classification in heterogeneous information networks. In 2021 IEEE 37th International Conference on Data Engineering (ICDE). pp. 912–923.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described with its respective citation. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, along with proper references for further exploration.
