To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CvFormer: Cross-view transFormers with Pre-training for fMRI Analysis of Human Brain" by Xiangzhu Meng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on two public datasets, specifically mentioning **ABIDE** and **ADNI**. This is a strong indication that these datasets are crucial for the research.

Next, I will delve into the **experiments section** where the authors provide more details about the datasets. They describe the **ADNI dataset** as containing neuroimaging data from 128 patients, categorized into different groups based on cognitive impairment stages. The **ABIDE dataset** is mentioned as containing data from 1112 subjects, including structural and resting state fMRI data along with phenotypic information.

I will also check the **preprocessing section** for any additional details about how these datasets were utilized in the experiments. The authors mention specific preprocessing steps for both datasets, which reinforces their importance in the study.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For the **ADNI dataset**, the citation is:
> Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. "ADNI: The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative." [Online]. Available: http://www.adni-info.org.

For the **ABIDE dataset**, the citation is:
> Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange. "ABIDE: Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange." [Online]. Available: http://preprocessed-connectomes-project.org/abide/download.html.

Having gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
