To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Factorized Contrastive Learning: Going Beyond Multi-view Redundancy" by Paul Pu Liang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the proposed method, FACTORCL, achieves state-of-the-art results on six benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly the subsections where datasets are explicitly listed or described. In this paper, the authors mention several datasets used for evaluation:

1. **MIMIC-III**: A dataset for mortality and disease prediction from 36,212 medical records, which includes tabular patient data and medical time-series sensors from ICU.

2. **MOSEI**: A multimodal sentiment and emotion benchmark with 23,000 monologue videos.

3. **MOSI**: A multimodal sentiment analysis dataset from 2,199 YouTube videos.

4. **UR-FUNNY**: A dataset of humor detection from more than 16,000 TED talk videos.

5. **MUSTARD**: A corpus of 690 videos for sarcasm detection from TV shows.

6. **IRFL**: A dataset containing 6,697 matching images and figurative captions.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper documentation and should include the authors, title, publication venue, and year.

For example, the citation for the **MIMIC-III** dataset is:
> Johnson, A. E. W., Pollard, T. J., Shen, L., Lehman, L. W. H., Feng, M., Ghassemi, M., Moody, B., Szolovits, P., Celi, L. A., & Mark, R. G. (2016). MIMIC-III, a freely accessible critical care database. *Scientific Data*, 3(1), 1-9.

I will repeat this process for each dataset mentioned in the paper to ensure that I have the correct and complete citations.

Finally, I will compile the extracted datasets and their citations into a structured format that can be easily reviewed or processed further. This will ensure that all relevant information is captured accurately and comprehensively.
