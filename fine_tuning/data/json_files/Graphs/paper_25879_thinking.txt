To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Convolutional Neural Network Features and the Original Image" by Connor J. Parde et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. In the abstract, the authors discuss the analysis of DCNN features and mention the use of two face recognition algorithms, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors reference performance on datasets such as **LFW (Labeled Faces in the Wild)**, **IJB-A (IARPA Janus Benchmark A)**, and **Mega-Face**. This indicates that these datasets are relevant to their research.

In the **methods section**, specifically in subsection III.B, the authors describe the **Janus CS2 dataset**, which includes 25,800 images of 500 subjects. They provide details about the dataset's features, including its expanded nature from the IJB-A dataset and the metadata used for analysis.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

1. **LFW (Labeled Faces in the Wild)**:

2. **IJB-A (IARPA Janus Benchmark A)**:

3. **Mega-Face**:
   > D. Miller, I. Kemelmacher-Shlizerman, and S. M. Seitz. *MegaFace: A million faces for recognition at scale*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1505.02108, 2015.

4. **Janus CS2 Dataset**:
   > The Janus CS2 dataset is described in the paper itself, but it is an expanded version of the IJB-A dataset, so I will cite the IJB-A reference for it as well.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research.
