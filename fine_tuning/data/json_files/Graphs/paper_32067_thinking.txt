To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Robust and Generalisable Segmentation of Subtle Epilepsy-causing Lesions: a Graph Convolutional Approach" by Hannah Spitzer et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions a "multi-centre dataset of 1015 participants with surface-based features and manual lesion masks from structural MRI data," indicating that a dataset is indeed present.

Next, I will look closely at **section 3.1 (Dataset and Implementation details)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the dataset used for their experiments. They specify that the dataset consists of post-processed surface-based features and manual lesion masks from **618 patients with FCD and 397 controls**, which is crucial information.

I will also note that the dataset is described as heterogeneous and clinically acquired from **22 international epilepsy surgery centres**, which adds context to its significance and diversity.

To ensure I have the correct citations, I will check the **References section** for any papers that describe the dataset or its components. The authors reference a previous study that likely provides the original dataset details. Specifically, they cite:
> Spitzer, H., Ripart, M., Whitaker, K., et al. *Interpretable surface-based detection of focal cortical dysplasias: a multi-centre epilepsy lesion detection study*. Brain 145(11), 3859â€“3871, 2022.

This citation is essential as it refers to the dataset used in their study.

Now, I will compile the dataset information, ensuring to include the full citation for the dataset as required. The dataset entries will be structured clearly, highlighting the number of participants, the nature of the data, and the citation.

After gathering all necessary information, I will prepare the dataset entries for further processing or review.
