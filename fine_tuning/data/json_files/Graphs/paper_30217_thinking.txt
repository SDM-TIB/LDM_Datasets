To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Simple and Powerful Architecture for Inductive Recommendation Using Knowledge Graph Convolutions" by Theis E. Jendal et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, and the introduction often outlines the datasets used for evaluation.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of inductive recommendation methods and mention the need for datasets that can handle sparse interactions. However, they do not specify dataset names here.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly where the authors describe their evaluation methodology. In this section, they explicitly mention two datasets used for their experiments:

1. **MovieLens-20m (ML-20m)**: This dataset contains ratings on movies and is widely used in recommendation system research. The authors note that it does not have an associated knowledge graph, but they utilize the MindReader KG for their experiments.

2. **Amazon-Book (AB)**: This dataset consists of reviews on books and is also used for evaluating their proposed method. Similar to ML-20m, it does not have an associated KG, but the authors mention using a constructed KG for evaluation.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **MovieLens-20m**, the citation is:
  > F Maxwell Harper and Joseph A Konstan. *The movielens datasets: History and context*. ACM Transactions on Interactive Intelligent Systems (TIIS), 5(4):1–19, 2015.

- For **Amazon Book**, the citation is:
  > Jianmo Ni, Jiacheng Li, and Julian McAuley. *Justifying Recommendations using Distantly-Labeled Reviews and Fine-Grained Aspects*. In Proceedings of the 2019 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing and the 9th International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing (EMNLP-IJCNLP), pages 188–197, 2019.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This structured approach will help in accurately documenting the datasets used in the research paper.
