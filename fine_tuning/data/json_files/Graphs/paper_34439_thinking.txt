To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Improved Bound for Robust Causal Bandits with Linear Models" by Zirui Yan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a concise overview of the research and may mention datasets used for evaluation or experimentation. 

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to see if the authors reference any datasets that are foundational to their work or that they compare their results against. This section often outlines the context and significance of the research, which may include key datasets.

Then, I will examine the **methodology** and **experiments sections** in detail. These sections typically describe the experimental setup, including any datasets used for training or testing the proposed algorithms. I will look for specific names of datasets, their characteristics, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

After identifying any datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like the "Causal Bandit Dataset," I would look for its citation in the references. If the dataset is not directly cited, I will note the authors and the year of the original dataset publication if available.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for easy reference, making sure to include all relevant details for each dataset extracted from the paper.
