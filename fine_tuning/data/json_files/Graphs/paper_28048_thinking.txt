To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Improve Unsupervised Pretraining for Few-label Transfer" by Suichan Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions conducting extensive experiments on **nine different target datasets**, which indicates that multiple datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors detail their methodology and the datasets used. In the **6.1 Experimental Setup** subsection, they explicitly list the nine target datasets used for their experiments:

1. **Pet37**: This dataset is referenced as a target dataset for few-label transfer.
2. **SUN397**: Another dataset mentioned for evaluation.
3. **DTD**: This dataset is also included in their experiments.
4. **CIFAR10**: A well-known dataset for image classification tasks.
5. **CIFAR100**: Similar to CIFAR10 but with more classes.
6. **Caltech101**: A dataset with a variety of object categories.
7. **Food101**: A dataset containing images of food items.
8. **EuroSAT**: A dataset for land use and land cover classification.
9. **ImageNet-1k**: Although primarily a source dataset, it is mentioned in the context of pretraining.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

Here are the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
