To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ED-Batch: Efficient Automatic Batching of Dynamic Neural Networks via Learned Finite State Machines" by Siyuan Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and evaluation sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions, but it may not specify datasets. The introduction often outlines the context and may reference datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 5), as this is where datasets are typically detailed. In this section, the authors mention evaluating their framework against other state-of-the-art runtimes and provide a table (Table 1) that lists the models and datasets used in the evaluation. 

From Table 1, I can identify the following datasets:

1. **WikiNER**: This dataset is used for named entity recognition tasks.
2. **English corpus (Nothman et al., 2013)**: This dataset is referenced for multilingual named entity recognition.
3. **IWSLT 2015 En-Vi**: This dataset is used for neural machine translation tasks.
4. **Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1994)**: This dataset is a well-known resource for various natural language processing tasks.

Now, I will look up the full citations for each dataset in the **References section** of the paper to ensure I have the correct and complete information.

- For **WikiNER**, the citation is:
  > Nothman, J., Ringland, N., Radford, W., Murphy, T., & Curran, J. R. (2013). Learning multilingual named entity recognition from Wikipedia. *Artificial Intelligence*, 194, 151â€“175.

- For **IWSLT 2015 En-Vi**, the citation is:
  > IWSLT 2015. International Workshop on Spoken Language Translation. Available at: http://iwslt2015.org/.

- For **Penn Treebank**, the citation is:
  > Marcus, M., Kim, G., Marcinkiewicz, M. A., MacIntyre, R., Bies, A., Ferguson, M., Katz, K., & Schasberger, B. (1994). The Penn Treebank: Annotating predicate argument structure. In *Human Language Technology: Proceedings of a Workshop held at Plainsboro, New Jersey, March 8-11, 1994*.

With these citations, I now have the necessary information to describe each dataset accurately.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and full citation, ensuring that all details are clear and complete for future reference or processing.
