To extract the datasets mentioned in the paper titled "Edge Aware Learning for 3D Point Cloud" by Lei Li, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. In the abstract, the authors state that their approach was validated using **ModelNet40** and **ShapeNet** datasets. This indicates that these datasets are likely important for the research.

Next, I will look closely at the **introduction section**, where the authors mention that point clouds are sourced from various online repositories, specifically naming **ModelNet** and **ShapeNet**. This reinforces the idea that these datasets are central to their work.

In the **experiments section**, the authors explicitly state that they conducted experiments using the **ModelNet40** and **ShapeNet** datasets. They provide details about the training process and evaluation metrics, confirming that these datasets are indeed utilized for their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For **ModelNet40**, the citation is:
   > Wu, Z., Song, S., Khosla, A., Yu, F., Zhang, L., Tang, X., & Xiao, J. (2015). 3D ShapeNets: A deep representation for volumetric shapes. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 1912-1920.

2. For **ShapeNet**, the citation is:
   > Chang, A. X., Funkhouser, T., Guibas, L., Hanrahan, P., Huang, Q., Li, Z., Savarese, S., Savva, M., Song, S., Su, H., et al. (2015). ShapeNet: An information-rich 3D model repository. arXiv preprint arXiv:1512.03012.

3. For **ScanNet**, which is also mentioned in the introduction as a relevant dataset, the citation is:
   > Dai, A., Chang, A. X., Savva, M., Halber, M., Funkhouser, T., & Nie√üner, M. (2017). ScanNet: Richly-annotated 3D reconstructions of indoor scenes. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 5828-5839.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, ready for further processing or review.
