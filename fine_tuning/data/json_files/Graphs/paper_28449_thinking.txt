To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Edge Rewiring Goes Neural: Boosting Network Resilience without Rich Features" by Shanchao Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for experiments. 

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 5) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, they mention using **synthetic datasets, the real EU power network, and Internet peer-to-peer networks**. I will look for specific details about these datasets, such as their characteristics, sizes, and any relevant statistics.

In the **experiments subsection (5.1)**, the authors provide more details about the datasets. They mention that synthetic datasets are generated using the Barabasi-Albert (BA) model, with sizes varying from 10 to 1000 nodes. They also refer to the Gnutella peer-to-peer network from August 2002 and the real EU power network. I will note down the specific names and characteristics of these datasets.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution. The paper cites various works related to the datasets, including the original sources for the Gnutella network and the EU power network.

For the **synthetic datasets**, I will note that they are generated based on the Barabasi-Albert model, but since they are not from a specific published source, I will not include a citation for them.

The citations I will extract are:
- For the **EU power network**:
  > Qiong Zhou and Janusz W Bialek. *Approximate model of European interconnected system as a benchmark system to study effects of cross-border trades*. IEEE Transactions on Power Systems, 20(2):782–788, 2005.

- For the **Gnutella peer-to-peer network**:
  > Jure Leskovec, Jon Kleinberg, and Christos Faloutsos. *Graph evolution: Densification and shrinking diameters*. ACM Transactions on Knowledge Discovery from Data (TKDD), 1(1):2–es, 2007.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for the datasets that have them, and summarize the characteristics of each dataset as described in the paper.

After completing this process, I will have a structured output ready for review or further processing.
