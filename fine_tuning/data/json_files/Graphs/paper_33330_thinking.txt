To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Neural Reasoning About Agents’ Goals, Preferences, and Actions" by Matteo Bortoletto, Lei Shi, and Andreas Bulling, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the **Baby Intuitions Benchmark (BIB)**, which is a clear indication that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will look for specific details about the **Baby Intuitions Benchmark** in the **introduction** and **experiments sections**. The introduction discusses the benchmark's purpose and its significance in evaluating AI models' reasoning about agents' goals and actions.

In the **methodology section**, I will find a detailed description of the BIB, including its structure and the tasks it encompasses. The paper states that the BIB consists of various tasks, such as Preference, Multi-Agent, Inaccessible Goal, Efficient Action, and Instrumental Action, which are derived from research on infant intuitive psychology.

I will also check the **appendix** for any additional details about the dataset, including the number of videos for each task and how they are structured. The appendix specifies that the evaluation set version 1.1 contains 1,000 videos for the Preference task, 1,000 for the Multi-Agent task, 1,111 for the Inaccessible Goal task, and so on.

Now, I will gather the full citation for the Baby Intuitions Benchmark from the references section. The citation is as follows:
> Gandhi, K., Stojnic, G., Lake, B. M., & Dillon, M. R. (2021). Baby Intuitions Benchmark (BIB): Discerning the goals, preferences, and actions of others. *Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems*, 34, 9963–9976.

Finally, I will compile the information about the dataset into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the Baby Intuitions Benchmark. This will allow for proper referencing and acknowledgment of the dataset used in the research.
