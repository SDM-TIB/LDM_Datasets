To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An accurate detection is not all you need to combat label noise in web-noisy datasets" by Paul Albert et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the challenges of training classifiers on web-crawled data and mentions the use of web-noisy datasets, which suggests that specific datasets may be referenced later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors describe the context of their research. They mention "web-noisy datasets" and refer to the Controlled Noisy Web Labels (CNWL) dataset, which is a key dataset for their experiments.

In the **experiments section**, particularly in section 4.1, the authors detail their experimental setup and explicitly mention the datasets used. They state that they conduct experiments on the CNWL dataset, which is a controlled web-noise corruption of the MiniImageNet dataset. This is crucial information as it identifies both the dataset and its source.

I will also check the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The CNWL dataset is referenced as follows:

- **Controlled Noisy Web Labels (CNWL)**:
  > Albert, P., Arazo, E., Krishna, T., Oâ€™Connor, N.E., McGuinness, K. *Addressing out-of-distribution label noise in webly-labelled data*. In: Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV), 2022.

- **MiniImageNet**:
  > Vinyals, O., Blundell, C., Lillicrap, T., Kavukcuoglu, K., Wierstra, D. *Matching Networks for One Shot Learning*. In: Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS), 2016.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use.

In summary, the key datasets extracted from the paper are:
1. **Controlled Noisy Web Labels (CNWL)** - used for experiments on web-noisy datasets.
2. **MiniImageNet** - referenced as part of the CNWL dataset creation.

I will ensure to include the full citations for both datasets in my final output.
