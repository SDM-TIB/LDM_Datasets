To extract datasets from the research paper titled "KDMCSE: Knowledge Distillation Multimodal Sentence Embeddings with Adaptive Angular Margin Contrastive Learning" by Cong-Duy Nguyen et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on **widely used Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) benchmarks**, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Dataset)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention:

1. **Flickr30k**: This dataset contains 29,783 training images, and each image is associated with multiple captions (usually five). This dataset is commonly used for multimodal tasks involving images and text.

2. **MS-COCO**: This dataset includes 82,783 training images, also with multiple captions per image. It is another widely recognized dataset in the field of computer vision and natural language processing.

Additionally, the authors mention using **Wiki1M** for their text-based dataset, which consists of 106 sentences extracted randomly from English Wikipedia. This dataset is used for text-only experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Flickr30k**, the citation is:
  > Young, P., Lai, A., Hodosh, M., & Hockenmaier, J. (2014). From image descriptions to visual denotations: New similarity metrics for semantic inference over event descriptions. *Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics*, 2, 67-78.

- For **MS-COCO**, the citation is:
  > Lin, T.-Y., Maire, M., Belongie, S., Hays, J., Perona, P., Ramanan, D., DollÃ¡r, P., & Zitnick, C. L. (2014). Microsoft COCO: Common objects in context. In *Proceedings of the European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV)* (pp. 740-755).

- For **Wiki1M**, the citation is:
  > Gao, T., Yao, X., & Chen, D. (2021). SimCSE: Simple contrastive learning of sentence embeddings. In *Proceedings of the 2021 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP)* (pp. 6894-6910).

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **Flickr30k**: A dataset containing 29,783 training images, each with multiple captions.
2. **MS-COCO**: A dataset with 82,783 training images, each associated with multiple captions.
3. **Wiki1M**: A text-based dataset consisting of 106 sentences extracted from English Wikipedia.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
