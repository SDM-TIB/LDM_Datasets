To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Image Keypoint Matching using Graph Neural Networks" by Nancy Xu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for evaluation. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, as it is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets used in the experiments. In this section, the authors explicitly mention two datasets for keypoint matching:

1. **PASCAL-VOC**: This dataset is noted for its annotations of body parts for 20 semantic classes. It is an extension of the PASCAL-VOC 2011 dataset.

2. **WILLOW-ObjectClass**: This dataset consists of 5 categories derived from Caltech-256 and PASCAL VOC 2007.

Additionally, the authors mention a third dataset for geometric feature matching:

3. **PASCAL-PF**: This dataset includes annotations for 20 semantic classes, specifically for keypoint coordinate pairs.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **PASCAL-VOC**, the citation is:
  > Everingham, M., Gool, L., Williams, C.K., Winn, J., Zisserman, A. (2010). *The PASCAL Visual Object Classes (VOC) Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 88(2), 303–338. https://doi.org/10.1007/s11263-009-0275-4

- For **WILLOW-ObjectClass**, the citation is:
  > Cho, M., Alahari, K., Ponce, J. (2013). *Learning graphs to match*. In: 2013 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision. pp. 25–32.

- For **PASCAL-PF**, the citation is:
  > Ham, B., Cho, M., Schmid, C., Ponce, J. (2016). *Proposal Flow*. In: Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
