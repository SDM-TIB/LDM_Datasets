To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Contrastive Training of Complex-Valued Autoencoders for Object Discovery" by Aleksandar Stanić et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their models on "multi-object color datasets," which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors mention three datasets: **Tetrominoes**, **dSprites**, and **CLEVR**. I will note down the context in which these datasets are used, including any specific details about their characteristics or the number of objects they contain.

In the **results section**, the authors provide performance metrics for their models on these datasets, which further confirms their relevance. I will also check the **appendices** for any additional details or clarifications regarding the datasets.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset from the **references section**. The citations are as follows:

1. **Tetrominoes Dataset**: 
   > Rishabh Kabra, Chris Burgess, Loic Matthey, Raphael Lopez Kaufman, Klaus Greff, Malcolm Reynolds, and Alexander Lerchner. *Multi-object datasets*. https://github.com/deepmind/multi-object-datasets/, 2019.

2. **dSprites Dataset**: 
   > Rishabh Kabra, Chris Burgess, Loic Matthey, Raphael Lopez Kaufman, Klaus Greff, Malcolm Reynolds, and Alexander Lerchner. *Multi-object datasets*. https://github.com/deepmind/multi-object-datasets/, 2019.

3. **CLEVR Dataset**: 
   > Patrick Emami, Pan He, Sanjay Ranka, and Anand Rangarajan. *Efficient iterative amortized inference for learning symmetric and disentangled multi-object representations*. In International Conference on Machine Learning, pages 2970–2981. PMLR, 2021.

Since the Tetrominoes and dSprites datasets are both part of the same multi-object datasets suite, they share the same citation. However, I will ensure to mention them separately in my final output.

Finally, I will compile the information about each dataset, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that I adhere to the required format for clarity and completeness.
