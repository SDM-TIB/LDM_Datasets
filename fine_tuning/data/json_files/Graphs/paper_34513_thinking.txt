To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Rethinking Class-Incremental Learning from a Dynamic Imbalanced Learning Perspective" by Leyuan Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to find any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark datasets, which indicates that datasets are likely discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets and Evaluation Metrics)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention three datasets:

1. **CIFAR100**: This dataset consists of 50,000 training images and 10,000 testing images, with 100 classes. Each class contains 500 training images and 100 testing images.

2. **ImageNet100**: A subset of the ImageNet dataset, it includes 129,395 training images and 5,000 testing images, randomly selected from 100 classes.

3. **TinyImageNet**: This dataset contains 100,000 training images and 10,000 testing images, with 100 classes, where each class has 500 training images and 50 testing images.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **CIFAR100**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009.

- For **ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, Li Fei-Fei. *ImageNet: A Large-Scale Hierarchical Image Database*. In 2009 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 248â€“255, 2009.

- For **TinyImageNet**, the citation is:
  > A. Krizhevsky, G. Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, which is essential for reproducibility and further research.

After completing this process, I will have a structured output ready for review or further processing.
