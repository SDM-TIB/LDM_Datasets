To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Letâ€™s Agree to Degree: Comparing Graph Convolutional Networks in the Message-Passing Framework" by Floris Geerts et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract typically provides a concise overview, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used in the research.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. This is where authors usually detail the datasets they used for their experiments, including any specific characteristics or configurations.

In this paper, I will pay close attention to any references to datasets used for evaluating the performance of the proposed methods. If the authors mention specific datasets, I will note their names and any relevant details provided, such as the number of samples, types of data, and any preprocessing steps.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, if the authors mention using the **Cora dataset**, I would look for its citation in the references, which might be something like:
> McCallum, A., & Koller, D. (2005). *Multi-View Learning for Text Classification*. In Proceedings of the 21st Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI 2005), pages 1-8.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for easy reference, making sure to include all relevant information for each dataset extracted from the paper.
