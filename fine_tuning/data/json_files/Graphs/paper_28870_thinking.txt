To extract datasets from the research paper titled "What can we learn from misclassified ImageNet images?" by Shixian Wen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to find any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the "Superclassing ImageNet dataset," indicating that this is a key dataset used in the research.

Next, I will look for detailed descriptions of the dataset in the **methodology section**. In section 3.1, the authors provide a comprehensive overview of the "Superclassing ImageNet dataset." They describe it as a hierarchical subset of the ImageNet dataset, consisting of 10 superclasses, each containing multiple subclasses. The dataset includes a total of 311,279 training images and 12,650 test images.

I will also check the **figures and tables** for additional information. For instance, Table 1 outlines the number of subclasses, training images, and test images for each superclass, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's structure.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citation for the original ImageNet dataset, as it is the foundational dataset from which the Superclassing ImageNet dataset is derived. The citation for the ImageNet dataset is:

- **ImageNet**: 
  > Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, and Li Fei-Fei. *Imagenet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In 2009 IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pages 248â€“255. IEEE, 2009.

Since the Superclassing ImageNet dataset is a subset of ImageNet, I will provide its details along with the citation for ImageNet.

Now, I will summarize the findings for the dataset:

1. **Superclassing ImageNet Dataset**: A hierarchical subset of the ImageNet dataset, containing 10 superclasses with a total of 311,279 training images and 12,650 test images.

2. **ImageNet Dataset**: The original dataset from which the Superclassing ImageNet dataset is derived.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for clarity and future reference.
