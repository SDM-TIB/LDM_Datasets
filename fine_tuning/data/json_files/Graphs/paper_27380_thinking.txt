To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fast Tucker Rank Reduction for Non-Negative Tensors Using Mean-Field Approximation" by Kazu Ghalamkari and Mahito Sugiyama, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the work, which may include references to datasets.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of low-rank approximation for tensors and mention that their method has been empirically demonstrated. However, I need to look for specific datasets used in their experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**. Here, the authors typically describe the datasets they used to validate their method. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and any relevant details about their structure or content.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention two datasets:

1. **4DLFD Dataset**: This dataset is described as a (9, 9, 512, 512, 3) tensor produced from 4D Light Field data. The authors state that it is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-Non-Commercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License.

2. **AttFace Dataset**: This dataset is a (92, 112, 400) tensor derived from the AT&T Database of Faces, which includes 400 grayscale face images. The authors note that while it is publicly available on Kaggle, the license is not specified.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

- For the **4DLFD Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Honauer, K., Johannsen, O., Kondermann, D., and Goldluecke, B. (2016). A dataset and evaluation methodology for depth estimation on 4D light fields. In Asian Conference on Computer Vision, pages 19–34. Springer.

- For the **AttFace Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Samaria, F. S., and Harter, A. C. (1994). Parameterisation of a stochastic model for human face identification. In Proceedings of 1994 IEEE Workshop on Applications of Computer Vision, pages 138–142. IEEE.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that all relevant details are captured accurately and can be referenced appropriately in future work.
