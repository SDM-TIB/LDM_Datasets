To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Why Molière most likely did write his plays" by Florian Cafiero and Jean-Baptiste Camps, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. These sections often provide a summary of the research and may mention any datasets used. In this case, the abstract discusses the use of computational linguistics and attribution methods, which suggests that there may be datasets related to the texts analyzed.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **Materials and Methods** section, as this is typically where authors describe the datasets they used for their analysis. In this paper, the authors mention using P. Fièvre’s electronic corpus of Classical French Theatre, which is a significant dataset for their study.

I will also check the **results** and **discussion** sections to see if the authors refer to any specific datasets or corpora that were analyzed. They mention a control corpus consisting of comedies in verse written after Molière’s time, which is another dataset relevant to their research.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. For the datasets identified:

1. **P. Fièvre’s electronic corpus of Classical French Theatre**: The citation is:
   > P. Fièvre, *Théâtre classique* (2007).

2. **Control corpus of comedies in verse**: Since this corpus is derived from the same criteria as the final corpus, it may not have a separate citation, but I will note that it is based on the same methodology as described in the paper.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, which is crucial for reproducibility and further studies in the field.
