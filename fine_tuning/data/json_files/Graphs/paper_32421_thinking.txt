To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Structured Low-Rank Tensors for Generalized Linear Models" by Batoul Taki et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for experiments or validation.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology and experiments sections**. These sections typically contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used, including their characteristics, dimensions, and any preprocessing steps taken. I will look for specific mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and any relevant details that describe their structure or purpose in the research.

In this paper, I notice that the authors mention three medical imaging datasets: **ABIDE Autism**, **ADHD200**, and **Vessel MNIST 3D**. I will extract the relevant details for each dataset:

1. **ABIDE Autism**: 
   - Description: Contains resting state fMRI data from 98 subjects, with each sample being a 111 × 116 matrix of fMRI data.
   - Train Size: 80
   - Test Size: 14
   - Citation: Craddock, C., et al. (2013). The Neuro Bureau preprocessing initiative: Open sharing of preprocessed neuroimaging data and derivatives. *Frontiers in Neuroinformatics*, 7, 27. doi:10.3389/conf.fninf.2013.09.00041.

2. **ADHD200**: 
   - Description: A repository of resting state fMRI images of 959 child subjects, with each sample being a 3D brain scan of size 121 × 145 × 121.
   - Train Size: 762
   - Test Size: 197
   - Citation: ADHD-200 Consortium. (2012). The ADHD-200 Consortium: A model to advance the translational potential of neuroimaging in clinical neuroscience. *Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience*, 6, 62. doi:10.3389/fnsys.2012.00062.

3. **Vessel MNIST 3D**: 
   - Description: Contains 1909 reconstructions of vessel segments from brain Magnetic Resonance Angiography (MRA) data, with each sample being a 28 × 28 × 28 3D image.
   - Train Size: 1335
   - Test Size: 382
   - Citation: Yang, J., et al. (2021). MedMNIST classification decathlon: A lightweight AutoML benchmark for medical image analysis. In *Proceedings of the 2021 IEEE 18th International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI)*, pp. 191–195. doi:10.1109/ISBI48211.2021.9434062.

After identifying these datasets, I will ensure that I have the correct citations for each dataset as they are crucial for proper referencing in any subsequent work or analysis.

Finally, I will compile the extracted information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset's details and citations, ready for further processing or review.
