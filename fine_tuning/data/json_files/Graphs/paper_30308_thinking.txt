To extract datasets from the research paper titled "LL-GNN: Low Latency Graph Neural Networks on FPGAs for High Energy Physics" by Zhiqiang Que et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by scanning the **abstract and introduction** sections for any mentions of datasets. In the introduction, the authors discuss the use of GNNs in high-energy physics applications, which may indicate the presence of specific datasets used for training or evaluation.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology or experiments sections**. In this paper, the authors mention using the **JEDI-net algorithm** for particle identification, which suggests that there may be specific datasets associated with this algorithm.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors reference two datasets:

1. **HLS4ML LHC Jet dataset (30 particles)**: This dataset is mentioned in the context of evaluating the performance of the GNN model. It is crucial to note the details provided about the dataset, such as its purpose and the number of particles it includes.

2. **HLS4ML LHC Jet dataset (50 particles)**: Similar to the first dataset, this one is also referenced for performance evaluation, and it includes a different number of particles.

Now, I will check the **References section** to obtain the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For the **HLS4ML LHC Jet dataset (30 particles)**, the citation is:
  > Javier Duarte et al. January, 2020. HLS4ML LHC Jet dataset (30 particles). (January, 2020). doi:10.5281/zenodo.3601436

- For the **HLS4ML LHC Jet dataset (50 particles)**, the citation is:
  > Javier Duarte et al. January, 2020. HLS4ML LHC Jet dataset (50 particles). (January, 2020). doi:10.5281/zenodo.3601443

With this information, I can now summarize the datasets extracted from the paper, ensuring that I include the full citations as required. This structured approach allows me to systematically identify and document the datasets relevant to the research presented in the paper.
