To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Convolutional Neural Networks on Graphs with Fast Localized Spectral Filtering" by Michaël Defferrard, Xavier Bresson, and Pierre Vandergheynst, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions experiments on **MNIST** and **20NEWS**, which suggests that these datasets are used in their evaluations.

Next, I will look for specific details about these datasets in the **experiments section**. In **section 4.1**, the authors describe their experiments on the **MNIST dataset**, which consists of 70,000 digits represented on a 2D grid of size 28 × 28. This dataset is widely known and used for benchmarking image classification tasks.

In **section 4.2**, the authors discuss the **20NEWS dataset**, which consists of 18,846 text documents associated with 20 classes. They mention that they extracted the 10,000 most common words from the corpus, indicating how they processed the dataset for their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **MNIST dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun, Léon Bottou, Yoshua Bengio, and Patrick Haffner. *Gradient-Based Learning Applied to Document Recognition*. In Proceedings of the IEEE, 86(11):2278–2324, 1998.

- For the **20NEWS dataset**, the citation is:
  > Thorsten Joachims. *A Probabilistic Analysis of the Rocchio Algorithm with TFIDF for Text Categorization*. Carnegie Mellon University, Computer Science Technical Report, CMU-CS-96-118, 1996.

Having gathered the necessary information, I will now compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
