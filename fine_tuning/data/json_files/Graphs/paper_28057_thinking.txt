To extract datasets from the research paper titled "They Chose to Not Tell You" by Bruce Knuteson, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and main sections** of the paper to locate any references to datasets. The abstract does not explicitly mention datasets, so I will proceed to the introduction and subsequent sections.

In the **introduction**, the author discusses suspicious return patterns in stock markets but does not specify any datasets. I will continue to the sections that follow, particularly focusing on any figures or tables that might reference data.

Next, I will examine **Section II (Strikingly Suspicious Overnight and Intraday Returns)**, where the author presents figures that illustrate the return patterns of various stock market indices. Here, I will look for any specific datasets used to generate these figures. The text mentions that data are publicly available from Yahoo! Finance, which suggests that the datasets are derived from historical stock price data.

In **Figure 1**, the author presents the value of one unit of local currency invested in various stock market indices, but does not provide a specific dataset name. However, the paper does mention that the data for these figures are sourced from Yahoo! Finance, which is a crucial piece of information.

I will also check the **References section** to see if any specific datasets are cited. The references primarily include articles and books related to financial markets but do not list specific datasets. However, the author does mention that the historical price data are available from Yahoo! Finance, which can be considered a dataset source.

To summarize, the key datasets identified in the paper are:

1. **Yahoo! Finance Historical Stock Price Data**: This dataset includes historical price data for various stock market indices used to analyze overnight and intraday returns.

Now, I will compile the full citation for the dataset source:

- For the **Yahoo! Finance Historical Stock Price Data**, the citation is:
  > Yahoo! Finance. *Historical price data*. Available at: https://finance.yahoo.com.

In conclusion, I will document the identified dataset and its citation, ensuring that I have accurately captured the relevant information from the paper.
