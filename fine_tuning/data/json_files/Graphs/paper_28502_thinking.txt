To extract datasets from the research paper titled "GACAN: Graph Attention-Convolution-Attention Networks for Traffic Forecasting Based on Multi-granularity Time Series" by Sikai Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors perform experiments on **three real-world datasets**, which indicates that datasets are indeed included.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section IV) where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. They mention three datasets:

1. **PeMSD4**: This dataset is collected from the Caltrans Performance Measurement System (PeMS) and contains traffic data aggregated every 5 minutes from 29 roads in San Francisco. The time span for this dataset is from January to March 2018.

2. **PeMSD7**: Similar to PeMSD4, this dataset is also collected from PeMS but is aggregated into minute intervals from 30-second data samples. The data for this dataset spans from May to June 2018.

3. **METR-LA**: This dataset contains traffic information collected from Los Angeles County, with data spanning from March to June 2019.

Now, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. However, since these datasets are commonly used in traffic forecasting research, they may not have formal citations like traditional datasets. Instead, I will note the source of each dataset as described in the paper.

The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- **PeMSD4**: Collected by the Caltrans Performance Measurement System (PeMS). The dataset can be accessed through the PeMS website.
  
- **PeMSD7**: Also collected by the Caltrans Performance Measurement System (PeMS). Available on the PeMS website.

- **METR-LA**: This dataset is available from the METR-LA project, which can be found online.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and their sources. This will ensure that I have a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, along with their proper citations.
