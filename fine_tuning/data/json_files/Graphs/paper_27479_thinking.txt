To extract datasets from the research paper titled "BA2M: A Batch Aware Attention Module for Image Classification" by Qishang Cheng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors validate their method through extensive experiments on **CIFAR-100** and **ImageNet-1K**. This indicates that these datasets are likely to be important for the research.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this section, the authors explicitly state that they conducted experiments on **CIFAR-100** and **ImageNet-1K**. I will take note of the details provided about these datasets, including their characteristics and any relevant statistics mentioned.

In the **experiments on CIFAR-100**, the authors describe it as a dataset containing 100 different classes, with 500 training images and 100 validation images per class. This information is crucial for understanding the dataset's structure.

For **ImageNet-1K**, the authors mention that it contains approximately 1.3 million training images and 50,000 validation images across 1,000 classes. This dataset is widely recognized in the field of image classification, and its details will be important for citation.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **CIFAR-100**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. Masterâ€™s thesis, Department of Computer Science, University of Toronto, 2009.

- For **ImageNet-1K**, the citation is:
  > Olga Russakovsky, Jia Deng, Hao Sheng Su, et al. *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision (IJCV), 2015.

Having gathered all the necessary information, I will now compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
