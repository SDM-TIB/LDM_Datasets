To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Ensemble manifold based regularized multi-modal graph convolutional network for cognitive ability prediction" by Gang Qu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the use of multi-modal functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to predict cognitive traits, which suggests that datasets related to fMRI are likely involved. The introduction further elaborates on the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC) as a dataset used for validation, indicating that I should focus on this dataset.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** in the paper, which is typically where authors describe the datasets used in their experiments. In this case, the **Experiments section** contains a subsection labeled **A. Datasets**, which provides detailed information about the datasets utilized.

In this subsection, the authors describe the **Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC)**, which consists of multiple fMRI paradigms acquired from over 800 healthy subjects aged 8 to 22 years. They specify that two task fMRI data types were used: the **emotion cognition task (emoid-fMRI)** and the **working memory task (nback-fMRI)**. The authors provide additional context about the tasks and the duration of the scans, which is useful for understanding the dataset's structure.

Now, I will gather the full citation for the PNC dataset from the **References section** of the paper. The relevant citations for the PNC are:

- For the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC):
  > Satterthwaite, T. D., et al. "The Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort: A publicly available resource for the study of normal and abnormal brain development in youth." *Neuroimage* 124 (2016): 1115-1119.

- For the Wide Range Achievement Test (WRAT):
  > Wilkinson, G. & Robertson, G. "Wide Range Achievement Test 4 (WRAT4)." *Journal of Occupational Psychology, Employment and Disability* 11.1 (2009): 49.

After collecting this information, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC)**: This dataset includes fMRI data from over 800 healthy subjects aged 8 to 22 years, with two specific tasks (emoid-fMRI and nback-fMRI) used for cognitive ability prediction.

2. **Wide Range Achievement Test (WRAT)**: This test measures individual abilities in reading, spelling, comprehension, and mathematical problem-solving, and serves as the label for assessing cognitive abilities in the study.

Finally, I will ensure that I have accurately captured the full citations for both datasets, as they are crucial for proper attribution and further research.

With all this information gathered, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for easy reference and future use.
