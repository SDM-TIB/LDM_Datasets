To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Instance Adaptive Prototypical Contrastive Embedding for Generalized Zero Shot Learning" by Riti Paul et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract states that the proposed method is evaluated on "three benchmark datasets," which indicates that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for any specific dataset names or descriptions. The introduction discusses the challenges of generalized zero-shot learning but does not provide specific dataset names.

I will then look into **section 4.1 (Datasets and Evaluation Metrics)**, where the authors provide a table summarizing the datasets used in their experiments. The table lists the following datasets:

1. **AWA1 (Animals with Attributes 1)**: This dataset contains 30,375 samples, with 40 seen labels and 10 unseen labels.
2. **AWA2 (Animals with Attributes 2)**: This dataset contains 37,322 samples, with 40 seen labels and 10 unseen labels.
3. **CUB (Caltech-UCSD Birds 200)**: This dataset contains 11,788 samples, with 150 seen labels and 50 unseen labels.
4. **SUN (Scene UNderstanding)**: This dataset contains 14,340 samples, with 645 seen labels and 72 unseen labels.

In the same section, the authors provide a brief description of the datasets, including the number of samples and the distribution of seen and unseen labels.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **AWA1**:
  > Christoph H. Lampert, Hannes Nickisch, and Stefan Harmeling. *Learning to detect unseen object classes by between-class attribute transfer*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 951–958, 2009.

- For **AWA2**:
  > Yongqin Xian, Christoph H. Lampert, Bernt Schiele, and Zeynep Akata. *Zero-shot learning - a comprehensive evaluation of the good, the bad and the ugly*. IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 2018.

- For **CUB**:
  > Catherine Wah, Steve Branson, Peter Welinder, Pietro Perona, and Serge Belongie. *The Caltech-UCSD Birds-200-2011 dataset*. 2011.

- For **SUN**:
  > Genevieve Patterson and James Hays. *SUN attribute database: Discovering, annotating, and recognizing scene attributes*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 2751–2758, 2012.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their full citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured all necessary details regarding the datasets used in the research.
