To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Graph Neural Network with Interaction Pattern for Group Recommendation" by Bojie Wang and Yuheng Lu, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors conducted experiments on **two real-world datasets**, which indicates that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 5) where the authors describe their experimental setup. In **Section 5.1.1 (Datasets)**, they explicitly mention the two datasets used for their experiments:

1. **CAMRa2011**: This dataset contains 602 users, 290 groups, and 7710 items, with an average group size of 2.08 and a total of 116,344 user-item interactions. The interactive repetition rate for this dataset is 0.825.

2. **MaFengWo**: This dataset consists of 5275 users, 995 groups, and 1513 items, with an average group size of 7.19 and a total of 3976 user-item interactions. The interactive repetition rate for this dataset is 0.09.

To ensure accuracy, I will also check the **References section** for any citations related to these datasets. However, the datasets appear to be original or specific to the authors' research, and they do not provide external citations for them.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the paper itself, as it is crucial for proper attribution.

The full citation for the paper is:
> Bojie Wang and Yuheng Lu. *Graph Neural Network with Interaction Pattern for Group Recommendation*. Neural Computing and Applications, Springer Nature, 2021.

With this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for further processing.
