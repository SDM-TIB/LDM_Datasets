To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Generative Self-Supervised Framework using Functional Connectivity in fMRI Data" by Jungwon Choi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the empirical results were obtained using large-scale fMRI datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention the following datasets:

1. **UK Biobank (UKB)**: This dataset consists of 40,913 samples and is noted as one of the most comprehensive fMRI datasets available. It includes demographic information such as gender and age, which are valuable for various pre-training tasks.

2. **Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD)**: This dataset comprises 9,111 samples from children and adolescents aged 9 to 11 years, focusing on their development. It also includes demographic information useful for developmental studies.

3. **Human Connectome Project (HCP) Young Adults**: This dataset includes 1,093 samples from participants aged 22 to 37 years, providing insights into brain connectivity in young adults.

4. **Human Connectome Project (HCP) Aging**: The HCP-A dataset consists of 724 samples focusing on older adults aged 36 to 90 years.

5. **Human Connectome Project (HCP) Development**: The HCP-D dataset includes 632 samples targeting developmental stages from ages 8 to 21 years.

6. **Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE)**: This dataset includes 884 clinical samples with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) labels.

7. **ADHD200**: This dataset contains 669 clinical samples with labels for Normal and ADHD conditions.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to gather the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their full citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
