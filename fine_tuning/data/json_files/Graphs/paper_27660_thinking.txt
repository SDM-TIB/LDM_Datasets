To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Schema-Aware Deep Graph Convolutional Networks for Heterogeneous Graphs" by Saurav Manchanda et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often highlights the datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experimental Methodology)**, where the authors describe the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they explicitly mention three datasets:

1. **IMDb Dataset**: The authors describe it as an online database about movies and television programs, including information such as cast, production crew, and plot summaries. They specify that they used a subset containing 4,278 movies, 2,081 directors, and 5,257 actors, with the task being to predict the genre of a movie.

2. **DBLP Dataset**: This dataset is described as a computer science bibliography website. The authors mention using a subset that includes 4,057 authors, 14,328 papers, 7,723 terms, and 20 publication venues, with the task being to predict the research area of an author.

3. **Synthetic Dataset**: The authors created a family of synthetic datasets to mimic real-world applications, detailing the schema and characteristics of these datasets, including the number of classes and node features.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **IMDb Dataset**, the citation is:
  > IMDb. *IMDb: The Movie Database*. [Online]. Available: https://www.imdb.com/

- For the **DBLP Dataset**, the citation is:
  > DBLP. *DBLP: Computer Science Bibliography*. [Online]. Available: https://dblp.org/

- The **Synthetic Dataset** does not have a specific citation as it is created by the authors for the purpose of this study.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for the IMDb and DBLP datasets, while noting that the synthetic dataset is an original creation of the authors without a formal citation.

This structured approach will ensure that I accurately extract and cite the datasets used in the research paper.
