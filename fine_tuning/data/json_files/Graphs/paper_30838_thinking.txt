To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Energy-based Generative Models for Target-specific Drug Discovery" by Junde Li, Collin Beaudoin, and Swaroop Ghosh, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the development of a model for drug discovery, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section IV (Experiments and Results)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, I find that the authors mention using the **PDBbind reﬁned 2017 dataset** for their experiments, which contains 3843 training molecules and 663 testing molecules. This is a clear indication of a dataset being utilized.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the PDBbind dataset. The relevant citation is:

- For **PDBbind Database**:
  > Wang, R., Fang, X., Lu, Y., & Wang, S. (2004). The PDBbind database: Collection of binding affinities for protein-ligand complexes with known three-dimensional structures. *Journal of Medicinal Chemistry*, 47(12), 2977–2980.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity.

In summary, the dataset extracted from the paper is the **PDBbind reﬁned 2017 dataset**, and the full citation is provided above. This process ensures that I have accurately captured the relevant dataset information from the research paper.
