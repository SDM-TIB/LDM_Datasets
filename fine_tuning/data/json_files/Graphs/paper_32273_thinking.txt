To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Simplicial Message Passing for Chemical Property Prediction" by Hai Lan and Xian Wei, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the application of the proposed framework for quantum-chemical properties prediction, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors detail their experimental setup. In **section 4.2**, they mention using five public datasets for chemical property prediction with topological data. The datasets listed are:

1. **Delaney Dataset**: This dataset is used for estimating aqueous solubility directly from molecular structure. It contains 1,144 samples.

2. **Huuskonen Dataset**: This dataset is used for estimating aqueous solubility based on molecular topology, containing 1,297 samples.

3. **OCHEM Dataset**: This dataset is part of the Online Chemical Modeling Environment, which provides a platform for data storage and model development, containing 1,311 samples.

4. **Tang Dataset**: This dataset is used for predicting molecular lipophilicity and aqueous solubility, containing 4,200 samples.

5. **Cui Dataset**: This dataset is used for predicting aqueous solubility of novel compounds, containing 9,943 samples.

In **section 4.3**, the authors mention two additional datasets for geometric data:

1. **MD17 Dataset**: This dataset provides energy and atomic forces of small organic molecules, with sizes ranging from 150k to nearly 1M conformational geometries.

2. **QM9 Dataset**: This dataset contains 133,885 stable small organic molecules with various quantum chemistry target properties.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to gather full citations for each dataset mentioned:

- For the **Delaney Dataset**, the citation is:

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented and properly cited.
