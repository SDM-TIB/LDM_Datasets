To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Chameleon: Adapting to Peer Images for Planting Durable Backdoors in Federated Learning" by Yanbo Dai and Songze Li, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. In the abstract, the authors mention conducting extensive experiments on multiple computer vision datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors explicitly mention using three datasets: **CIFAR10**, **CIFAR100**, and **EMNIST**. I will note down the context in which these datasets are used, particularly focusing on how they relate to the experiments conducted.

In the **experiments section**, the authors describe the use of these datasets for evaluating their proposed method, Chameleon. They provide details about the types of backdoors tested on each dataset, which is crucial for understanding the datasets' roles in the research.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

1. **CIFAR10**:
   > Krizhevsky, A., Hinton, G., et al. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. 2009.

2. **CIFAR100**:
   > Krizhevsky, A., Hinton, G., et al. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. 2009.

3. **EMNIST**:
   > Cohen, G., Afshar, S., Tapson, J., and Van Schaik, A. *EMNIST: Extending MNIST to handwritten letters*. In 2017 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN), pp. 2921â€“2926. IEEE, 2017.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets, their context in the research, and their full citations. This will ensure that I have a comprehensive understanding of the datasets used in the study and can present them accurately.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for easy reference and further processing.
