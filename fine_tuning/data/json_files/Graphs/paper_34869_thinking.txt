To extract datasets from the research paper titled "GRAPHCNNPRED: A Stock Market Indices Prediction Using a Graph Based Deep Learning System" by Yuhui Jin, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and dataset sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the use of a diversified dataset for predicting stock market trends, which indicates that specific datasets are likely discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (The Dataset)**, where the author provides a brief outline of the dataset used. The paper states that the dataset is originally from another source, which suggests that I need to look for the citation of that original dataset. The author mentions having 82 daily features categorized into eight groups, but does not provide a specific name for the dataset itself.

Since the dataset is referenced as being from another paper, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the original dataset. The relevant citation is:

- For the original dataset, the citation is:
  > Ehsan Hoseinzade and Saman Haratizadeh. *CNNpred: CNN-based stock market prediction using a diverse set of variables*. In Expert Systems with Applications, 129 (2019), pp. 273â€“285.

This citation indicates that the dataset used in the current paper is derived from the work of Hoseinzade and Haratizadeh, which is crucial for proper attribution.

Now, I will summarize the findings regarding the dataset:

1. **Dataset Name**: The dataset is not explicitly named in the paper, but it is derived from the work of Hoseinzade and Haratizadeh.
2. **Description**: The dataset consists of 82 daily features categorized into eight groups, including primitive features, technical indicators, economic data, and more.
3. **Citation**: The full citation for the original dataset is provided above.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines the dataset's details, ensuring that the citation is included for proper referencing. This will allow for accurate documentation and facilitate further research or application of the findings from this paper.
