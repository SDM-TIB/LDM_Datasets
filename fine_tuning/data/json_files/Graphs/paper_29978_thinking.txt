To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Mitigating the Performance Sacrifice in DP-Satisfied Federated Settings through Graph Contrastive Learning" by Haoran Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the experiments conducted, which may include references to datasets.

In the **introduction**, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets used for the experiments. The authors may describe the datasets in the context of their research, which will help me identify them.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.2 (Datasets and Baselines)**, where the authors typically provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used in their experiments. In this section, I expect to find the names of the datasets along with their characteristics.

The paper mentions the following datasets:

1. **SIDER**: Contains information about medicines and their observed adverse drug reactions, including drug classification.
2. **BACE**: Provides qualitative binding results (binary labels) for a set of inhibitors of human beta-secretase 1.
3. **ClinTox**: Compares FDA-approved drugs with those that failed clinical trials for toxicity reasons, assigning binary labels to indicate toxicity.
4. **BBBP**: Designed for modeling and predicting barrier permeability, with binary labels indicating whether drug molecules can penetrate the blood-brain barrier.
5. **Tox21**: Contains graphs of chemical compounds, with each compound having 12 labels reflecting outcomes in different toxicological experiments.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for each dataset.

The citations for the datasets are as follows:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This structured approach will ensure that I capture all relevant details for each dataset mentioned in the paper.
