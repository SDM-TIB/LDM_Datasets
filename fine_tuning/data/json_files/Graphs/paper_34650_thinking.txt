To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Contrastive learning of T cell receptor representations" by Yuta Nagano et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study and may mention datasets used for training or evaluation. The introduction often discusses the background and significance of the research, which might include references to specific datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, where the authors typically describe the datasets in detail. This section is crucial as it often includes information about the size, composition, and source of the datasets. I will look for any specific dataset names mentioned, such as "VDJdb" or any other relevant datasets used for T cell receptor (TCR) specificity prediction.

In the **results section**, I will check for any additional mentions of datasets, especially if the authors report performance metrics or comparisons based on different datasets. This can provide further confirmation of the datasets used in the study.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is essential for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research. I will look for papers or resources that describe the datasets in detail.

For example, if the authors mention using the "VDJdb" dataset, I will find the corresponding citation, which might look something like this:
> Bagaev, D. V., Vroomans, R. M. A., Samir, J., Stervbo, U., Rius, C., Dolton, G., et al. (2020). Nucleic Acids Research, 48(D1), D1057.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details and that the citations are accurate and complete.
