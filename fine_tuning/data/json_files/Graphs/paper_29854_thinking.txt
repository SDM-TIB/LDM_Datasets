To extract datasets from the research paper titled "NodeTrans: A Graph Transfer Learning Approach for Traffic Prediction" by Xueyan Yin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that experiments were conducted on "real-world datasets," which indicates that specific datasets will be discussed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically provide details about the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, they explicitly mention four datasets:

1. **PEMSD4**: This dataset consists of traffic flow data collected from 307 nodes over a time span from January 1, 2018, to February 28, 2018, with a total of 16,992 time steps.

2. **PEMSD8**: Similar to PEMS-D4, this dataset includes traffic flow data from 170 nodes, collected from July 1, 2016, to August 31, 2016, totaling 17,856 time steps.

3. **PEMS-BAY**: This dataset contains traffic speed data from 325 nodes, collected from January 1, 2017, to May 31, 2017, with a total of 52,116 time steps.

4. **METR-LA**: This dataset includes traffic speed data from 207 nodes, collected from March 1, 2012, to June 30, 2012, with a total of 34,772 time steps.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **PEMSD4** and **PEMSD8**, the citation is:
  > Chen, C., Petty, K., Skabardonis, A., Varaiya, P., & Jia, Z. (2001). Freeway performance measurement system: mining loop detector data. *Transportation Research Record*, 1748(1), 96-102.

- For **PEMS-BAY**, the citation is:
  > Li, Y., Yu, R., Shahabi, C., & Liu, Y. (2018). Diffusion convolutional recurrent neural network: Data-driven traffic forecasting. In *International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR)*.

- For **METR-LA**, the citation is:
  > Li, Y., Yu, R., Shahabi, C., & Liu, Y. (2018). Diffusion convolutional recurrent neural network: Data-driven traffic forecasting. In *International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR)*.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described with its respective citation. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
