To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Contrastive Learning for Sports Video: Unsupervised Player Classification" by Maria Koshkina et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the evaluation of their approach using a "new hockey dataset," which indicates that a dataset is indeed present. The introduction further emphasizes the importance of team membership classification and hints at the dataset's significance in sports video analytics.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, specifically **section 3 (Method)**, where the authors describe the dataset in detail. Here, they introduce a new labeled hockey video dataset that will be made public upon acceptance of the paper. They provide specifics about the dataset, including that it is drawn from 15 different hockey games captured over two seasons, with details about the camera setup and the number of frames extracted from each game.

In **section 3.2 (Dataset)**, the authors elaborate on the dataset's characteristics, including:
- The dataset consists of video clips from 15 hockey games.
- It includes manual annotations for player detection and team classification.
- The dataset is divided into training, validation, and test sets with a specific split ratio.

I will also check the **References section** to find any citations related to the dataset. However, since the authors mention that the dataset will be made public upon acceptance, there may not be a formal citation yet. Instead, I will note that the dataset is newly introduced and will be available in the future.

The key dataset information I will extract includes:
1. **Hockey Dataset**: A new annotated dataset for evaluating player detection and team classification algorithms, consisting of video clips from 15 different hockey games.

Since the dataset is newly introduced and does not have a formal citation yet, I will note that it is forthcoming and provide the authors' acknowledgment of the dataset's availability.

Finally, I will compile the extracted dataset information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset's name, description, and any relevant details, while also noting the lack of a formal citation at this time.

After completing these steps, I will have a comprehensive understanding of the dataset mentioned in the paper, ready for further processing or review.
