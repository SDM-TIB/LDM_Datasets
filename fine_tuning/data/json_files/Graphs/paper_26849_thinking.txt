To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Robust Graph Attention Network with Dynamic Adjusted Graph" by Xianchen Zhou et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and while it may not explicitly mention datasets, it sets the context for the research. The introduction often discusses the background and may reference datasets used in prior work, which can be helpful.

Next, I will focus on **section 5.1.1 (Experimental datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention three benchmark datasets: **Cora**, **Citeseer**, and **Polblogs**. I will take note of the details provided for each dataset, including the number of nodes, edges, classes, and features.

For each dataset, I will then look into the **References section** to find the full citations. The authors reference other works that describe these datasets, which is crucial for proper attribution. 

The citations for the datasets are as follows:

1. **Cora Dataset**: 
   > Kipf, T.N., Welling, M. "Semi-supervised classification with graph convolutional networks." In International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR), 2017.

2. **Citeseer Dataset**: 
   > Sen, P., Namata, G., Bilgic, M., Getoor, L., and Galstyan, A. "Collective classification for network data." In Proceedings of the 2008 SIAM International Conference on Data Mining, 2008.

3. **Polblogs Dataset**: 
   > Adamic, L.A., and Glance, N. "The political blogosphere and the 2004 U.S. election: divided they blog." In Proceedings of the 3rd International Workshop on Link Discovery, 2005.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This structured approach will help in accurately documenting the datasets used in the research paper.
