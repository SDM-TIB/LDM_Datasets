To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Entity Aware Syntax Tree Based Data Augmentation for Natural Language Understanding" by Jianbin Cui et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on several datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experiment)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they mention three datasets:

1. **SNIPS Natural Language Understanding benchmark (SNIPS-NLU)**: This dataset consists of over 16,000 utterances with 7 intents. It is specifically designed for evaluating natural language understanding systems.

2. **Airline Travel Information Systems (ATIS)**: This dataset provides a large number of messages along with their associated intents and slots, making it suitable for training classifiers and slot fillers.

3. **CoNLL-2003**: This is a classic dataset for named entity recognition (NER) tasks, containing English and German news articles focused on four types of named entities: persons, locations, organizations, and miscellaneous entities.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **SNIPS**, the citation is:
  > Coucke, A., Saade, A., Ball, A., Bluche, T., Caulier, A., Leroy, D., Doumouro, C., Gisselbrecht, T., Caltagirone, F., Lavril, T., Primet, M., and Dureau, J. (2018). *Snips voice platform: an embedded spoken language understanding system for private-by-design voice interfaces*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1805.10190.

- For **ATIS**, the citation is:
  > Hemphill, C., Godfrey, J. J., and Doddington, G. (1990). *The ATIS spoken language systems pilot corpus*. In Proceedings of the 1990 DARPA Speech and Natural Language Workshop, pages 96–101.

- For **CoNLL-2003**, the citation is:
  > Tjong Kim Sang, E. F., and De Meulder, F. (2003). *Introduction to the CoNLL-2003 shared task: Language-independent named entity recognition*. In Proceedings of the seventh conference on Natural language learning at HLT-NAACL 2003-Volume 4, pages 142–147.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets with their respective details and citations, ensuring that I maintain clarity and accuracy in the descriptions. This will allow for a comprehensive understanding of the datasets used in the research.
