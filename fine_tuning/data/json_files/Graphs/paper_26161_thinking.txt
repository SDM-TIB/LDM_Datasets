To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Structure fusion based on graph convolutional networks for semi-supervised classification" by Guangfeng Lin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract states that the experiments were conducted on "three challenging datasets," which indicates that specific datasets will be discussed later in the paper.

Next, I will navigate to **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention three datasets:

1. **Cora Dataset**: This dataset consists of 2,708 publications grouped into 7 classes, with a total of 5,429 edges. Each publication is represented by a one-hot vector indicating the presence or absence of words.

2. **Citeseer Dataset**: This dataset includes 3,327 scientific papers divided into 6 classes, with 4,732 edges. Similar to Cora, each paper is represented by a one-hot vector.

3. **Pubmed Dataset**: This dataset contains 19,717 diabetes-related publications categorized into 3 classes, with 44,338 edges. Each publication is described using a term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) representation.

The authors provide a table (Table 1) summarizing the statistics of these datasets, which confirms the details mentioned in the text.

To ensure accuracy, I will then check the **References section** for the full citations of these datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **Cora Dataset**, the citation is:
  > M. McCallum, K. Nigam, "A comparison of event models for Naive Bayes text classification," in Proceedings of the AAAI-98 Workshop on Learning for Text Categorization, 1998.

- For the **Citeseer Dataset**, the citation is:
  > C. Lee, "CiteSeer: An Autonomous Citation Indexing System," in Proceedings of the 1st ACM International Conference on Digital Libraries, 1996.

- For the **Pubmed Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Z. Wu, S. Pan, F. Chen, G. Long, C. Zhang, P. S. Yu, "A comprehensive survey on graph neural networks," arXiv preprint arXiv:1901.00596, 2019.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations.
