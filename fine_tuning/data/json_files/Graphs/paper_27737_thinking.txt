To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Self-supervised Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network with Co-contrastive Learning" by Xiao Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments on "four public datasets," which indicates that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets**. In this paper, the relevant information is found in **section 5.1 (Datasets)**. Here, the authors explicitly list the datasets used in their experiments, along with some statistics about each dataset. The datasets mentioned are:

1. **ACM Dataset**: This dataset consists of papers, authors, and subjects, with specific counts for each type of node.
2. **DBLP Dataset**: This dataset includes authors, papers, conferences, and terms, with their respective counts.
3. **Freebase Dataset**: This dataset contains movies, actors, directors, and writers, along with their counts.
4. **AMiner Dataset**: This dataset consists of papers, authors, and references, with their respective counts.

Now, I will extract the full citations for each dataset from the **References section** of the paper. The citations are as follows:

- For the **ACM Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Jianan Zhao, Xiao Wang, Chuan Shi, Zekuan Liu, and Yanfang Ye. *Network Schema Preserving Heterogeneous Information Network Embedding*. In IJCAI, pages 1366–1372, 2020.

- For the **DBLP Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Xinyu Fu, Jiani Zhang, Ziqiao Meng, and Irwin King. *MAGNN: Metapath Aggregated Graph Neural Network for Heterogeneous Graph Embedding*. In WWW, pages 2331–2341, 2020.

- For the **Freebase Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Xiang Li, Danhao Ding, Ben Kao, Yizhou Sun, and Nikos Mamoulis. *Leveraging Meta-path Contexts for Classification in Heterogeneous Information Networks*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2012.10024, 2020.

- For the **AMiner Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Binbin Hu, Yuan Fang, and Chuan Shi. *Adversarial Learning on Heterogeneous Information Networks*. In SIGKDD, pages 120–129, 2019.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, along with their full citations for reference.
