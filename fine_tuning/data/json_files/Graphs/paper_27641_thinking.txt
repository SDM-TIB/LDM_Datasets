To extract datasets from the research paper titled "KAMA: 3D Keypoint Aware Body Mesh Articulation" by Umar Iqbal et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the proposed method is evaluated on the **3DPW** and **Human3.6M** datasets, which indicates that these datasets are crucial for understanding the performance of the method.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used. In this section, they explicitly mention:

1. **Human3.6M**: This dataset is referenced as a standard protocol for training and testing, specifically mentioning that they use five subjects for training and two for testing. 

2. **3D Poses in-the-Wild (3DPW)**: The authors describe this dataset as consisting of 60 videos recorded in diverse environments, with ground-truth poses obtained using IMU sensors.

3. **RenderPeople**: This synthetic dataset is mentioned as having ground-truth annotations for all 26 keypoints used in their method, generated from characters and poses.

4. **MS-COCO**: This dataset is used as a weakly-labeled set for training the 3D keypoint regressor, providing 2D annotations for 18 keypoints.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. The citations are as follows:

- **Human3.6M**:

- **3D Poses in-the-Wild (3DPW)**:
  > Timo von Marcard, Roberto Henschel, Michael Black, Bodo Rosenhahn, and Gerard Pons-Moll. *Recovering accurate 3D human pose in the wild using IMUs and a moving camera*. In ECCV, 2018.

- **RenderPeople**:

- **MS-COCO**:
  > Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, Serge Belongie, James Hays, Pietro Perona, Deva Ramanan, Piotr Dollár, and C Lawrence Zitnick. *Microsoft COCO: Common objects in context*. In ECCV, 2014.

After gathering all this information, I will summarize the datasets and their citations in a clear format, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its full citation for future reference or processing.
