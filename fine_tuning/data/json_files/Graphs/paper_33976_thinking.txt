To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Anatomical Structure-Guided Medical Vision-Language Pre-training" by Qingqiu Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions evaluating the proposed framework on **five public benchmarks**, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 3) where the authors discuss the datasets used for evaluation. They specifically mention two tasks: medical image classification and medical semantic segmentation. I will look for the names of the datasets used in these tasks.

In the **subsection 3.1 (Experimental Setting)**, the authors list the datasets for medical image classification:
1. **NIH ChestX-ray**: This dataset is referenced as a large dataset for chest radiographs.
2. **CheXpert**: Another dataset mentioned for chest radiograph classification.
3. **RSNA**: This dataset is also used for classification tasks.
4. **COVIDx**: A dataset specifically for COVID-19 detection from chest X-ray images.

In the **subsection 3.2 (Experimental Results)**, the authors mention the datasets used for medical semantic segmentation:
1. **SIIM**: This dataset is used for pneumothorax segmentation.
2. **RNSA**: Another dataset mentioned for segmentation tasks.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. 

- For **NIH ChestX-ray**, the citation is:

- For **SIIM**, the citation is:
  > Anna, Z., Carol, W., George, S., Julia, E., Mikhail, F., Mohannad, H., Paras Lakhani, Phil, C., Shunxing, B. "SIIM-ACR Pneumothorax Segmentation." (2019), https://kaggle.com/competitions/siim-acr-pneumothorax-segmentation.

- For **RNSA**, the citation is:
  > Shih, G., Wu, C.C., Halabi, S.S., Kohli, M.D., Prevedello, L.M., Cook, T.S., Sharma, A., Amorosa, J.K., Arteaga, V., Galperin-Aizenberg, M., et al. "Augmenting the National Institutes of Health Chest Radiograph Dataset with Expert Annotations of Possible Pneumonia." *Radiology: Artificial Intelligence*, 1(1), e180041 (2019).

With these citations in hand, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing.
