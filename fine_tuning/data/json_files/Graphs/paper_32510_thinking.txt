To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Black-box Adversarial Attacks against Dense Retrieval Models: A Multi-view Contrastive Learning Method" by Yu-An Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on two web search benchmark datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed present in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors explicitly mention two datasets in the **experimental settings** section:

1. **MS MARCO Document Ranking dataset**: This dataset is described as a large-scale benchmark dataset for web document retrieval, containing approximately 3.21 million documents.

2. **MS MARCO Passage Ranking dataset**: This dataset is another large-scale benchmark, specifically for web passage retrieval, with about 8.84 million passages.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the MS MARCO datasets are as follows:

- For the **MS MARCO Document Ranking dataset**, the citation is:
  > Tri Nguyen, Mir Rosenberg, Xia Song, Jianfeng Gao, Saurabh Tiwary, Rangan Majumder, and Li Deng. *MS MARCO: A Human Generated Machine Reading Comprehension Dataset*. In CoCo@NIPS, 2016.

- For the **MS MARCO Passage Ranking dataset**, the citation is the same as the document ranking dataset, as they are part of the same benchmark:
  > Tri Nguyen, Mir Rosenberg, Xia Song, Jianfeng Gao, Saurabh Tiwary, Rangan Majumder, and Li Deng. *MS MARCO: A Human Generated Machine Reading Comprehension Dataset*. In CoCo@NIPS, 2016.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets and their citations clearly, ensuring that I have accurately captured all necessary details for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This will allow for a comprehensive understanding of the datasets used in the research.
