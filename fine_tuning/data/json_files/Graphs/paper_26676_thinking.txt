To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Adaptive Graph Convolutional Recurrent Network for Traffic Forecasting" by Lei Bai et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract states that the authors evaluate their method on two real-world traffic datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they describe two datasets:

1. **PeMSD4**: This dataset contains traffic flow data from the San Francisco Bay Area, collected from 307 loop detectors over a period from January 1, 2018, to February 28, 2018.

2. **PeMSD8**: This dataset includes traffic flow information from 170 loop detectors in the San Bernardino area, collected from July 1, 2016, to August 31, 2016.

The authors also provide details about the data preprocessing steps, which include filling missing values and aggregating the data into 5-minute windows.

To ensure I have the correct citations, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **PeMSD4**, the citation is:
  > Chao Chen, Karl Petty, Alexander Skabardonis, Pravin Varaiya, and Zhanfeng Jia. *Freeway performance measurement system: mining loop detector data*. Transportation Research Record, 1748(1):96–102, 2001.

- For **PeMSD8**, the citation is:
  > Yaguang Li, Rose Yu, Cyrus Shahabi, and Yan Liu. *Diffusion convolutional recurrent neural network: Data-driven traffic forecasting*. In the Sixth International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR), 2018.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use.

In summary, I will extract the following datasets with their full citations:
1. **PeMSD4**: Traffic flow data from the San Francisco Bay Area.
   - Citation: Chao Chen, Karl Petty, Alexander Skabardonis, Pravin Varaiya, and Zhanfeng Jia. *Freeway performance measurement system: mining loop detector data*. Transportation Research Record, 1748(1):96–102, 2001.

2. **PeMSD8**: Traffic flow information from the San Bernardino area.
   - Citation: Yaguang Li, Rose Yu, Cyrus Shahabi, and Yan Liu. *Diffusion convolutional recurrent neural network: Data-driven traffic forecasting*. In the Sixth International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR), 2018.

With this information, I am ready to proceed with any further processing or analysis required.
