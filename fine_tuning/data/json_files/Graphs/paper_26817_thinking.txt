To extract datasets from the research paper titled "RDF2Vec Light – A Lightweight Approach for Knowledge Graph Embeddings" by Jan Philipp Portisch et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and evaluation sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the RDF2Vec Light method and its efficiency but does not explicitly mention datasets. Therefore, I will look for specific references to datasets in the introduction and evaluation sections.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention public knowledge graphs like **DBpedia** and **Wikidata** as examples of knowledge graphs that can be used for downstream tasks. However, they do not specify datasets here.

Next, I will examine the **evaluation section** where the authors describe their experiments. They mention that they repeated experiments from Ristoski et al. [6] and Pellegrino et al. [4], which suggests that these papers may contain datasets relevant to their evaluation.

Upon reviewing the references, I find that Ristoski et al. [6] discusses RDF2Vec and its applications, while Pellegrino et al. [4] provides a framework for evaluating node embedding techniques. I will need to check these papers for any datasets they might have used.

In the **results tables**, the authors refer to various datasets used for classification and regression tasks, specifically mentioning:

1. **Cities Dataset**: This dataset is used for classification and regression tasks, but the paper does not provide a detailed description or citation.

2. **Albums Dataset**: Similar to the Cities dataset, it is mentioned in the context of classification and regression tasks without further details.

3. **Movies Dataset**: Again, this dataset is referenced but lacks specific details or citations.

4. **Forbes Dataset**: This dataset is also mentioned in the results but is not described in detail.

Since the paper does not provide full citations for these datasets, I will need to look for the original sources of these datasets in the references or through external searches.

Now, I will compile the datasets I have identified along with their citations:

- For the **Cities Dataset**, I will refer to Ristoski et al. [6] for its citation:
  > Ristoski, P., Rosati, J., Noia, T.D., Leone, R.D., Paulheim, H. *RDF2Vec: RDF graph embeddings and their applications*. Semantic Web 10(4), 721–752, 2019.

- For the **Albums Dataset**, I will also refer to Ristoski et al. [6] as it is likely included in their evaluation framework.

- The **Movies Dataset** and **Forbes Dataset** will similarly be cited from Ristoski et al. [6] or Pellegrino et al. [4] if they are mentioned there.

Finally, I will ensure that I have the correct citations for each dataset and prepare to format them according to the required structure. This will involve confirming the details from the original papers or datasets if necessary.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing.
