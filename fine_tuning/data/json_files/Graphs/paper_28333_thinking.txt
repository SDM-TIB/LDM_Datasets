To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "GeomGCL: Geometric Graph Contrastive Learning for Molecular Property Prediction" by Shuangli Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract states that the authors evaluate their method on "seven real-life molecular datasets," which indicates that multiple datasets are involved.

Next, I will look for a dedicated section that discusses the datasets in detail. In this case, **section 5 (Experiments)** provides a table (Table 1) summarizing the datasets used for evaluation. The table lists the following datasets:

1. **ClinTox**: This dataset is used for classification tasks and contains 1,484 molecules.
2. **Sider**: Another classification dataset with 1,427 molecules.
3. **Tox21**: This dataset is used for classification and includes 7,831 molecules.
4. **ToxCast**: A classification dataset with 8,597 molecules.
5. **ESOL**: This dataset is used for regression tasks and contains 1,128 molecules.
6. **FreeSolv**: Another regression dataset with 643 molecules.
7. **Lipophilicity**: This regression dataset includes 4,200 molecules.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The paper mentions that these datasets are sourced from MoleculeNet, which is a benchmark for molecular machine learning.

The full citation for the MoleculeNet datasets is:
> Wu, Z.; Ramsundar, B.; Feinberg, E. N.; Gomes, J.; Geniesse, C.; Pappu, A. S.; Leswing, K.; and Pande, V. (2018). *MoleculeNet: a benchmark for molecular machine learning*. Chemical Science, 9(2): 513â€“530.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations. Each dataset will be described with its name, task type, number of molecules, and the full citation.

After completing this process, I will have a structured output ready for review or further processing.
