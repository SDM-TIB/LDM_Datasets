To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Semantic Contrastive Learning" by Jiabo Huang and Shaogang Gong, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments on six object recognition benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they mention:

1. **CIFAR-10**: A natural image dataset composed of 60,000 samples uniformly drawn from 10 classes.
2. **CIFAR-100**: Similar to CIFAR-10 but with 100 classes, containing 60,000 samples.
3. **STL-10**: An ImageNet adapted dataset consisting of 1,300 images from each of 10 classes, with additional images from unknown classes.
4. **ImageNet-10**: A subset of ImageNet containing samples from 10 randomly selected classes.
5. **ImageNet-Dogs**: A subset of ImageNet containing samples from 15 dog breeds.
6. **Tiny-ImageNet**: Another subset of ImageNet with 100,000 samples evenly distributed across 200 classes.

I will confirm that these datasets are indeed used in the experiments by cross-referencing with the **experiments section** where the authors discuss their evaluation metrics and results.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:

- For **CIFAR-10** and **CIFAR-100**:
  > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. Technical report, Citeseer, 2009.

- For **STL-10**:
  > Adam Coates, Andrew Ng, and Honglak Lee. *An analysis of single-layer networks in unsupervised feature learning*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Machine Learning, pages 215–223, 2011.

- For **ImageNet**:
  > Olga Russakovsky, Jia Deng, Hao Su, Jonathan Krause, Sanjeev Satheesh, Sean Ma, Zhiheng Huang, Andrej Karpathy, Aditya Khosla, Michael Bernstein, et al. *ImageNet large scale visual recognition challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 115(3):211–252, 2015.

- For **Tiny-ImageNet**:
  > Ya Le and Xuan Yang. *Tiny ImageNet Visual Recognition Challenge*. CS 231N, 2015.

With this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
