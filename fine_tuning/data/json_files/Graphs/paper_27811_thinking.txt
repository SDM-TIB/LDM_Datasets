To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Leveraging Tripartite Interaction Information from Live Stream E-Commerce for Improving Product Recommendation" by Sanshi Yu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract indicates that the authors collected a **real-world Live Stream E-Commerce (LSEC) dataset**, which suggests that there are datasets relevant to their research.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors mention that they collected **two novel datasets from an E-Commerce website with different scales**. This is a clear indication that there are specific datasets that need to be identified.

In the **experiments section**, particularly in **section 6.1 (Dataset Description)**, the authors provide detailed information about the datasets used for their experiments. They mention two datasets:

1. **LSEC-Small**: This dataset includes interaction data from an E-Commerce website, with statistics indicating it contains 31,630 items, 29,422 users, and 4,633 streamers, along with various interaction counts.

2. **LSEC-Large**: This dataset is a larger version, containing 109,502 items, 202,850 users, and 7,395 streamers, with significantly more interaction data.

The authors also provide a table summarizing the statistics of both datasets, which confirms their existence and details.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. However, since these datasets are newly collected and not publicly available, there may not be formal citations for them. Instead, I will note the authors' intention to publish the datasets and code for community use, as mentioned in the paper.

The relevant citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **LSEC-Small** and **LSEC-Large**, the citation is:
  > Sanshi Yu, Zhuoxuan Jiang, Dong-Dong Chen, Shanshan Feng, Dongsheng Li, Qi Liu, Jinfeng Yi. 2021. Leveraging Tripartite Interaction Information from Live Stream E-Commerce for Improving Product Recommendation. In Proceedings of the 27th ACM SIGKDD Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD ’21), August 14–18, 2021, Virtual Event, Singapore. ACM, New York, NY, USA, 9 pages. https://doi.org/10.1145/3447548.3467151

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
