To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Simple Spectral Failure Mode for Graph Convolutional Networks" by Carey E. Priebe et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus, which may hint at the datasets used.

Next, I will examine the **background and experiments sections**. These sections often contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the experiments. I will look for any specific names of datasets, their characteristics, and how they were utilized in the context of the research.

In this paper, I will pay particular attention to any mention of graphs or datasets related to graph convolutional networks, as the title suggests a focus on graph-based methods. I will also look for any tables or figures that might summarize the datasets or their properties.

After identifying potential datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets used in the research.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like the "Erdos-Renyi Graph" or "Latent Position Graph," I will ensure to find the original source or relevant citation for these datasets. If the paper does not provide a direct citation, I may need to conduct a brief literature search to find authoritative references for these datasets.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will help me accurately document the datasets used in the research paper and provide a clear reference for future readers.
