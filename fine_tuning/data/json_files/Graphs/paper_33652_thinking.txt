To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Time Series Supplier Allocation via Deep Black-Litterman Model" by Jiayuan Luo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions "extensive experimentation on two datasets," which indicates that datasets are indeed used, but I need to find their specific names and details.

Next, I will examine **section 5.1.1 (Experiment Setup)**, where the authors explicitly state the datasets used for evaluation. They mention two datasets:

1. **MCM Dataset**: This dataset comprises supply and order data from 401 suppliers over 240 weeks. This provides a clear description of the dataset's scope and context.

2. **SZ Dataset**: This dataset includes data from 218 suppliers across 731 days. Again, this gives insight into the dataset's structure and the time frame it covers.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. However, since the datasets are not attributed to specific papers or sources in the text, I will note that the datasets are likely proprietary or collected by the authors themselves, as is common in applied research.

Since the datasets do not have formal citations, I will document them as follows:

- **MCM Dataset**: No formal citation available; described as supply and order data from 401 suppliers over 240 weeks.
- **SZ Dataset**: No formal citation available; described as data from 218 suppliers across 731 days.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format, ensuring that I clearly indicate the lack of formal citations while providing the descriptions as outlined above. This will ensure that the information is organized and ready for any further processing or review.
