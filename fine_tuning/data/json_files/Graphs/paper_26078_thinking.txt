To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Craquelure as a Graph: Application of Image Processing and Graph Neural Networks to the Description of Fracture Patterns" by Oleksii Sidorov and Jon Hardeberg, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or data sources.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the significance of craquelure patterns in artworks and the need for effective analysis methods. However, I need to focus on sections that specifically mention datasets.

Next, I will examine **section 4 (Experimental)**, particularly **subsection 4.1 (Dataset)**, where the authors describe the dataset used for their experiments. Here, they mention that the dataset consists of 36 high-resolution grayscale photographs of paintings from various geographical origins, collected from Dr. Spike Bucklow. This section provides crucial details about the dataset, including the number of images, their resolution, and the augmentation process used to increase the dataset size.

Now, I will gather the full citation for the dataset mentioned. The authors reference Dr. Spike Bucklow's work, which is essential for the citation. I will check the **References section** to find the appropriate citation for Bucklow's work.

The citation for the dataset is:
> Bucklow, S. (1999). The description and classification of craquelure. *Studies in Conservation*, 44(4), 233–244.

With this information, I can summarize the dataset as follows:

1. **Dataset Name**: Craquelure Dataset
   - **Description**: The dataset consists of 36 high-resolution grayscale photographs of Italian, French, Flemish, German, and Dutch paintings from the XIV–XVIII centuries. Each image has a resolution of 1181×1772 pixels and captures a spatial region of 3×5 cm to 12×20 cm. The dataset was augmented by random cropping and reflections, resulting in a total of 360 images labeled by geographical origin.
   - **Citation**: Bucklow, S. (1999). The description and classification of craquelure. *Studies in Conservation*, 44(4), 233–244.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
