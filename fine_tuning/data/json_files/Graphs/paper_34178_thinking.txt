To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "A Clinical-oriented Multi-level Contrastive Learning Method for Disease Diagnosis in Low-quality Medical Images" by Qingshan Hou et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the proposed method is validated on two public medical image datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experiments)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the datasets used for validation. Here, they mention:

1. **EyeQ Dataset**: This dataset is described as a large public fundus image benchmark for diabetic retinopathy grading and quality assessment, containing 12,543 training and 16,249 testing images. The images are categorized based on image quality and diabetic retinopathy severity.

2. **Chest X-ray Dataset**: This dataset is derived from the NIH-ChestXray14 multi-label dataset, consisting of 8,573 training and 7,007 testing frontal X-ray images. It includes two quality labels (high and low) and eight disease types.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper:

- For the **EyeQ Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Fu, H., Wang, B., Shen, J., Cui, S., Xu, Y., Liu, J., Shao, L. "Evaluation of retinal image quality assessment networks in different color-spaces." In: Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention–MICCAI 2019: 22nd International Conference, Shenzhen, China, October 13–17, 2019, Proceedings, Part I 22. pp. 48–56. Springer (2019).

- For the **Chest X-ray Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Wang, X., Peng, Y., Lu, L., Lu, Z., Bagheri, M., Summers, R.M. "ChestX-ray8: Hospital-scale chest x-ray database and benchmarks on weakly-supervised classification and localization of common thorax diseases." In: Proceedings of the IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition. pp. 2097–2106 (2017).

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
