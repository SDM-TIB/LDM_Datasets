To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Contrastive Cross-domain Recommendation in Matching" by Ruobing Xie et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the development of a new dataset called **CDR-427M**, which is a strong indicator that this is a key dataset used in the research.

Next, I will look for detailed descriptions of the dataset in the **experiments section**. Here, the authors provide a comprehensive overview of the **CDR-427M dataset**, which includes:

- The dataset is built from a real-world recommendation system named WeChat Top Stories.
- It contains a source domain and two target domains, specifically a few-shot target domain and a strict cold-start target domain.
- The dataset includes nearly **63 million users** and **427 million behaviors** on **3.0 million items**.
- Additional item-related information includes **187 thousand tags**, **356 categories**, **56 thousand media**, and **207 thousand words**.

The authors also mention that the dataset is split into training and testing sets using chronological order, which is important for understanding how the dataset is structured.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. However, since the dataset is newly created for this study, it may not have a separate citation like established datasets. Instead, I will document the dataset details as provided in the paper.

The key dataset extracted from this paper is:

1. **CDR-427M Dataset**: 
   - Description: A dataset extracted from WeChat Top Stories, containing user behaviors and item-related information for cross-domain recommendation.
   - Size: 63 million users, 427 million behaviors, 3.0 million items, 187 thousand tags, 356 categories, 56 thousand media, and 207 thousand words.
   - Structure: Split into training and testing sets based on chronological order.

Since there is no separate citation for the CDR-427M dataset in the references, I will note that it is a proprietary dataset created for the study.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format for clarity and future reference.
