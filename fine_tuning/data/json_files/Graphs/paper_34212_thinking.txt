To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Latent Guard: a Safety Framework for Text-to-image Generation" by Runtao Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified on **three datasets**, which indicates that specific datasets are used.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section (Section 4)**, particularly **subsection 4.1 (Dataset details)**, where the authors describe the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they introduce the **CoPro (Concepts and Prompts) dataset**, which is a key dataset created specifically for their research. The authors provide details about the dataset, including the number of harmful concepts and the total number of safe/unsafe prompts generated.

The paper states that the CoPro dataset includes:
- **723 harmful concepts**
- A total of **176,516 safe/unsafe prompts** for text-to-image models, with specific splits for training, validation, and testing.

Additionally, the authors mention the use of **out-of-distribution (OOD) concepts** for evaluation, which further supports the robustness of their method.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. However, since the CoPro dataset is newly created and not previously published, it may not have a formal citation. The authors do mention that they will release the dataset for research purposes, which is important to note.

For the datasets mentioned, I will compile the following information:
1. **CoPro Dataset**: This dataset is central to their experiments and is described in detail in the paper.

The citation for the CoPro dataset will be:
> Liu, R., Khakzar, A., Gu, J., Chen, Q., Torr, P., & Pizzati, F. (2023). *Latent Guard: a Safety Framework for Text-to-image Generation*. [Dataset available at GitHub: https://github.com/rt219/LatentGuard].

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets in a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the CoPro dataset as it is crucial for proper attribution and future reference.
