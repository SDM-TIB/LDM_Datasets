To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Bridging Mini-Batch and Asymptotic Analysis in Contrastive Learning: From InfoNCE to Kernel-Based Losses" by Panagiotis Koromilas et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for empirical validation. 

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, which typically contains detailed information about the datasets used for testing the proposed methods. In this section, the authors often describe the datasets, including their characteristics and the specific tasks they are used for.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention using several datasets for their experiments, specifically:

1. **CIFAR10**: A widely used dataset for image classification containing 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class.

2. **CIFAR100**: Similar to CIFAR10 but with 100 classes containing 600 images each.

3. **STL-10**: A dataset for unsupervised feature learning, consisting of 10 classes with 5,000 labeled and 100,000 unlabeled images.

4. **ImageNet-100**: A subset of the larger ImageNet dataset, containing 100 classes with a varying number of images per class.

Next, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and further exploration of the datasets.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

- **CIFAR10**:
  > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical Report, 2009.

- **CIFAR100**:
  > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical Report, 2009.

- **STL-10**:
  > Adam Coates, Andrew Y. Ng, and Honglak Lee. *An Analysis of Single-Layer Networks in Unsupervised Feature Learning*. In Proceedings of the 14th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics (AISTATS), 2011.

- **ImageNet-100**:
  > Olga Russakovsky, Jia Deng, Hao Sheng, et al. *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 115(3):211â€“252, 2015.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will summarize this information in a structured format for clarity and future reference. This will ensure that I have captured all necessary details regarding the datasets used in the research.
