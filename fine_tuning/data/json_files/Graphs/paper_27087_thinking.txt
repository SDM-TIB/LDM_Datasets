To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On the Compression of Translation Operator Tensors in FMM-FFT-Accelerated SIE Simulators via Tensor Decompositions" by Cheng Qian and Abdulkadir C. Yucel, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the methodologies and results, but it may not explicitly mention datasets. Therefore, I will focus on the introduction and methodology sections for more detailed information.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges faced by FMM-FFT-SIE simulators and the need for memory reduction techniques. They mention the use of tensor decompositions but do not specify datasets yet.

Next, I will examine the **methodology section**, where the authors describe their experiments and the specific scenarios they tested. Here, they mention using numerical tests to demonstrate the performance of their proposed methodologies. I will look for any references to datasets used in these tests.

As I continue through the paper, I will pay special attention to any **figures, tables, or references** that might indicate the datasets used. If the authors refer to specific datasets or provide numerical results based on datasets, I will note these down.

In the **results section**, the authors present numerical results and comparisons. If they mention specific datasets or benchmarks used for validation, I will extract that information.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, if the authors refer to a dataset like the "Penn Action Dataset," I will look for its citation in the references. If they mention a dataset that is not widely known, I will ensure to find the original source or publication that describes it.

Finally, I will compile the extracted datasets along with their full citations into a structured format for clarity and ease of use.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and cite the datasets used in the research paper.
