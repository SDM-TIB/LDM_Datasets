To extract datasets from the research paper titled "KGLens: A Parameterized Knowledge Graph Solution to Assess What an LLM Does and Doesnâ€™t Know" by Shangshang Zheng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. In the abstract, the authors mention conducting experiments using **three domain-specific KGs from Wikidata**, which indicates that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors describe the knowledge graphs they constructed. They specifically mention three domain-specific knowledge graphs related to **country, NBA, and movies**. This is a clear indication that these are the datasets used for their experiments.

In the **methodology section**, the authors provide details about how they built these knowledge graphs using data from Wikidata. They mention that the country KG includes knowledge about **16 countries**, the NBA KG contains knowledge related to **30 NBA teams**, and the movie KG is sampled from films released after **2015**. This gives me a clearer understanding of the datasets' scope and content.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets. However, since the datasets are derived from Wikidata and not from specific publications, I will note that the datasets are based on the following:

1. **Country KG**: A knowledge graph containing information about 16 countries.
2. **NBA KG**: A knowledge graph containing information related to 30 NBA teams.
3. **Movie KG**: A knowledge graph sampled from films released after 2015.

Since these datasets are based on Wikidata, I will provide the citation for Wikidata as the source of these datasets:

- For **Wikidata**, the citation is:
  > Wikimedia Foundation. *Wikidata: A free collaborative knowledge base*. Available at: https://www.wikidata.org

Now, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and citations, ensuring that each dataset is properly documented for future reference.
