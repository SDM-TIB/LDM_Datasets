To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Bridge to Target Domain by Prototypical Contrastive Learning and Label Confusion: Re-explore Zero-Shot Learning for Slot Filling" by Liwen Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses zero-shot cross-domain slot filling and mentions improvements in performance, which suggests that datasets may be involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors describe their methodology and the datasets used. In this section, they mention evaluating their method on the **SNIPS dataset**, which is a public spoken language understanding dataset containing multiple domains and slots. This is a clear indication that a dataset is being utilized.

I will then look for specific details about the **SNIPS dataset** in the text. The authors mention that they simulate cross-domain scenarios by selecting one domain as the target domain and using the remaining six as source domains. This indicates that the dataset is structured to facilitate such experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the SNIPS dataset. The citation provided in the references is:

- For **SNIPS dataset**:
  > Alice Coucke, Alaa Saade, Adrien Ball, Théodore Bluche, Alexandre Caulier, David Leroy, Clément Doumouro, Thibault Gisselbrecht, Francesco Caltagirone, Thibaut Lavril, Maël Primet, and Joseph Dureau. *Snips voice platform: an embedded spoken language understanding system for private-by-design voice interfaces*. In Proceedings of the 2018 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, Volume 2 (Short Papers), pages 753–757, New Orleans, Louisiana. Association for Computational Linguistics, 2018.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry for the SNIPS dataset, ensuring to include the full citation as required.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry in the specified format, ready for further processing or review.
