To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Data Poisoning Attack Against Unsupervised Node Embedding Methods" by Mingjie Sun et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses evaluating the proposed attack model on multiple real-world graphs, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments** section. In this paper, the authors mention three datasets used for evaluation:

1. **Facebook Dataset**: A social network graph with 4,039 nodes and 88,234 edges.
2. **Cora Dataset**: A citation network with 2,708 nodes and 2,708 edges.
3. **Citeseer Dataset**: Another citation network with 2,110 nodes and 7,336 edges.

I will confirm the details of these datasets by checking the **experiments section**, where the authors provide specific information about the datasets used for their experiments.

Now, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **Facebook Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Jure Leskovec and Julian J. Mcauley. *Learning to Discover Social Circles in Ego Networks*. In NIPS, 2012.

- For the **Cora Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Prithviraj Sen, Galileo Mark Namata, Mustafa Bilgic, Lise Getoor, Brian Gallagher, and Tina Eliassi-Rad. *Collective Classification in Network Data*. AI Magazine, 29(3):93â€“106, 2008.

- For the **Citeseer Dataset**, the citation is:
  > C. Lee Giles, Kurt D. Bollacker, and Steve Lawrence. *Citeseer: An Automatic Citation Indexing System*. In The Third ACM Conference on Digital Libraries, 1998.

With these citations in hand, I will compile the dataset information, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
