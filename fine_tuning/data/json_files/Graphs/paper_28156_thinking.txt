To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fed-TGAN: Federated Learning Framework for Synthesizing Tabular Data" by Zilong Zhao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental analysis sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method on **four widely used datasets**, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experimental Analysis)**, where the authors describe their experimental setup. They mention that they test their algorithm on four commonly used machine learning datasets: **Adult, Covertype, Credit, and Intrusion**. This section provides a clear indication of the datasets used for evaluation.

In **Table 1**, the authors provide a summary of the datasets, including the number of rows and columns for each dataset. This table will be crucial for understanding the characteristics of each dataset.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset from the **References section** of the paper:

1. **Adult Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Dua, D., & Graff, C. (2017). UCI machine learning repository. http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml.

2. **Covertype Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Dua, D., & Graff, C. (2017). UCI machine learning repository. http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml.

3. **Credit Dataset**: The citation is:
   > M. L. G. ULB. (2018). Kaggle - anonymized credit card transactions labeled as fraudulent or genuine. https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud.

4. **Intrusion Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Dua, D., & Graff, C. (2017). UCI machine learning repository. http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml.

With this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, along with their respective sources.
