To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Efficient Egocentric Visual Perception: Combining Eye-tracking, a Software Retina and Deep Learning" by Nina Hristozova, Piotr Ozimek, and Jan Paul Siebert, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and data collection sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors collected a database of over 26,000 images of 9 object classes, which suggests that a dataset is present.

Next, I will focus on the **data collection section** where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset. They mention that the dataset consists of over 26,000 images categorized into three parts: Training (80%), Validation (18%), and Test (2%). The object classes included are Eggs, Gnocchi, Juice, Ling, Milk, Rice, Strep, VitC, and Yogurt. This section confirms the existence of a dataset and provides essential details about its structure.

I will also check the **conclusions section** to see if there are any additional insights or clarifications regarding the dataset. However, the main details are already captured in the data collection section.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The dataset is not attributed to a specific external source but is described as a custom dataset collected by the authors using Tobii Pro 2 eye-tracking glasses. Therefore, I will create a citation that reflects this:

- **Custom Dataset of 26,000 Images**: 
  > Hristozova, N., Ozimek, P., & Siebert, J. P. (2018). Efficient Egocentric Visual Perception: Combining Eye-tracking, a Software Retina and Deep Learning. EPIC Workshop @ ECCV2018, Munich, Germany.

With this information, I can now compile the dataset entry. The dataset is a custom collection, and I will ensure to include the citation in the final output.

After gathering all necessary details, I will prepare the dataset entry in the required format for further processing or review.
