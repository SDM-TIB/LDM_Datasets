To extract datasets from the research paper titled "One Perturbation is Enough: On Generating Universal Adversarial Perturbations against Vision-Language Pre-training Models" by Hao Fang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments on various VLP models and tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved. I will look for specific mentions of datasets in these sections.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental setup section** (Section 5), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention several datasets:

1. **Flickr30K**: This dataset is described as containing 31,783 images, each with five associated captions, and is used for image-text retrieval tasks.

2. **MSCOCO**: This dataset consists of 123,287 images, each annotated with approximately five sentences, and is utilized for testing the attack performance on image-text retrieval and image captioning tasks.

3. **SNLI-VE**: This dataset is used for visual entailment tasks and provides large-scale images and descriptions with logical relationship labels.

4. **RefCOCO+**: This dataset is specifically used for visual grounding tasks and contains 19,992 images with 141,564 annotations.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations I will extract are:

- For **Flickr30K**:
  > Plummer, B. A., Wang, L., Cervantes, C. M., Caicedo, J. C., Hockenmaier, J., & Lazebnik, S. (2015). Flickr30k entities: Collecting region-to-phrase correspondences for richer image-to-sentence models. In *ICCV* (pp. 2641–2649).

- For **MSCOCO**:
  > Lin, T.-Y., Maire, M., Belongie, S., Hays, J., Perona, P., Ramanan, D., Dollár, P., & Zitnick, C. L. (2014). Microsoft coco: Common objects in context. In *Computer Vision–ECCV 2014: 13th European Conference* (pp. 740–755).

- For **SNLI-VE**:
  > Xie, N., Lai, F., Doran, D., & Kadav, A. (2019). Visual entailment: A novel task for fine-grained image understanding. *arXiv preprint arXiv:1901.06706*.

- For **RefCOCO+**:
  > Yu, L., Poirson, P., Yang, S., Berg, A. C., & Berg, T. L. (2016). Modeling context in referring expressions. In *Computer Vision–ECCV 2016: 14th European Conference* (pp. 69–85).

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their proper citations.
