To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Adaptive Margin Ranking Loss for Knowledge Graph Embeddings via a Correntropy Objective Function" by Mojtaba Nayyeri et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on standard benchmark datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section (Section 4)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they mention two datasets: **FB15k** and **WN18**. I will take note of any specific details provided about these datasets, such as their characteristics or the context in which they were used.

In the **experimental setup (Section 4.1)**, the authors provide additional information about the datasets, including the embedding size and the number of epochs used for training. However, the most critical information regarding the datasets is their names and the context of their use in the experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **FB15k**, the citation is:
  > Zhang, F., Yuan, N. J., Lian, D., Xie, X., & Ma, W. Y. (2016). Collaborative knowledge base embedding for recommender systems. In Proceedings of the 22nd ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (pp. 353–362).

- For **WN18**, the citation is:
  > Bordes, A., Glorot, X., Weston, J., & Bengio, Y. (2013). Translating embeddings for modeling multi-relational data. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems (pp. 2787–2795).

Having gathered the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
