To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Efficient and Effective Implicit Dynamic Graph Neural Network" by Yongjian Zhong et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions conducting extensive experiments on real-world datasets for classification and regression tasks, which indicates that datasets are likely discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets**. In this paper, the relevant section is **5.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors provide a summary of the datasets used in their experiments. Here, I will carefully note the names and descriptions of each dataset mentioned.

The datasets identified in this section are:

1. **Brain Dataset**: Derived from real-world fMRI brain scans, where nodes represent brain tissues and edges capture activation time similarity. The goal is to predict the functionality of each node across 10 categories.

2. **DBLP Dataset**: An extracted co-author network from the DBLP website, where nodes are authors and edges represent co-authorship relationships. The attributes are word2vec representations of titles and abstracts from related papers.

3. **Reddit Dataset**: Extracted from Reddit, where nodes represent posts and edges are constructed based on similar keywords. The attributes are word2vec representations of comments, and labels correspond to communities.

4. **PeMS04 and PeMS08 Datasets**: Represent traffic sensor networks in California, where nodes symbolize road sensors and edges denote geographical distances. The datasets capture average traffic statistics over time.

5. **England-COVID Dataset**: Created from mobility logs released by Facebook, where nodes are cities and edges represent transportation statistics. The task is to predict the infection rate based on historical data.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations of the datasets. However, the paper does not provide specific citations for the datasets used, as they are commonly known datasets in the field.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their descriptions and ensure that I have documented the information clearly and accurately.

Finally, I will summarize the findings, ensuring that each dataset is properly described and that I have noted any relevant details that could be useful for future reference or analysis.
