To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Few-shot link prediction via graph neural networks for Covid-19 drug-repurposing" by Vassilis N. Ioannidis et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the application of their method on the **drug-repurposing knowledge graph (DRKG)**, which indicates that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors discuss the creation of the **Drug Repurposing Knowledge Graph (DRKG)**, which is a comprehensive biological knowledge graph relating various biological entities. This section also references the use of the **IMDB** and **DBLP** datasets for their experiments, which is crucial for dataset extraction.

In **section 4 (Experiments)**, the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. They provide a table (Table 1) that summarizes the statistics of the datasets, including the number of nodes, edges, and relation types for both the **IMDB** and **DBLP** datasets. This section confirms the datasets utilized in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The citations I need to extract are:

1. For the **IMDB dataset**, the citation is:
   > Fu, X., Zhang, J., Meng, Z., & King, I. (2020). Magnn: Metapath aggregated graph neural network for heterogeneous graph embedding. In Proceedings of The Web Conference 2020 (pp. 2331â€“2341).

2. For the **DBLP dataset**, the citation is the same as the IMDB dataset since they are both detailed in the same reference.

Additionally, the authors mention that the **DRKG** was constructed in a previous work by Ioannidis et al. (2020). Therefore, I will also include this citation:
   > Ioannidis, V. N., Song, X., Manchanda, S., Li, M., Pan, X., Zheng, D., Ning, X., Zeng, X., & Karypis, G. (2020). DRKG - Drug Repurposing Knowledge Graph for COVID-19. Retrieved from https://github.com/gnn4dr/DRKG/.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
