To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MultiScale MeshGraphNets" by Meire Fortunato et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of learned models for numerical simulations, but I need to look for specific datasets.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention the use of MeshGraphNets and the challenges of high-resolution simulations, but they do not specify datasets here. I will move on to the **experimental setup section**.

In **section 4 (Experimental setup)**, the authors describe the creation of a dataset called **"CylinderFlow"**. They mention that this dataset comprises 1000 trajectories of incompressible flow past a long cylinder in a channel, simulated with COMSOL. Each trajectory consists of 200 time steps, with varying parameters such as the radius and position of the obstacle, inflow initial velocity, and mesh resolution.

Next, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The authors used COMSOL for the simulations, and the reference for COMSOL is:

> COMSOL. *Comsol multiphysicsÂ® v. 5.4*. http://comsol.com, 2020.

Since the dataset is generated using COMSOL, I will include this citation as the reference for the CylinderFlow dataset.

Now, I will summarize the dataset information:

1. **CylinderFlow Dataset**: This dataset consists of 1000 trajectories of incompressible flow past a long cylinder in a channel, with each trajectory having 200 time steps. The parameters vary, including the radius and position of the obstacle, inflow initial velocity, and mesh resolution.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for review or further processing, ensuring that the full citation for the dataset is included.
