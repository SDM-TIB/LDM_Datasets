To extract datasets from the research paper titled "United We Stand, Divided We Fall: UnityGraph for Unsupervised Procedure Learning from Videos" by Siddhant Bansal et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors tested their framework on benchmark datasets, which indicates that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this paper, they mention three datasets: **EgoProceL**, **ProceL**, and **CrossTask**. I will take note of how each dataset is characterized in terms of its purpose and the type of data it contains.

1. **EgoProceL**: This dataset consists of 62 hours of egocentric videos of 130 subjects performing 16 tasks. It is specifically designed for procedure learning in first-person videos.

2. **ProceL**: This dataset includes 47.3 hours of videos from 12 diverse tasks, making it suitable for third-person procedure learning.

3. **CrossTask**: This dataset comprises 213 hours of videos from 18 primary tasks, also aimed at third-person procedure learning.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

- For **EgoProceL**, the citation is:
  > Siddhant Bansal, Chetan Arora, and C.V. Jawahar. *My View is the Best View: Procedure Learning from Egocentric Videos*. In European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), 2022.

- For **ProceL**, the citation is:
  > Ehsan Elhamifar and Zwe Naing. *Unsupervised Procedure Learning via Joint Dynamic Summarization*. In International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2019.

- For **CrossTask**, the citation is:
  > Dimitri Zhukov et al. *Cross-task weakly supervised learning from instructional videos*. In Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2019.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that highlights each dataset's name, description, and citation. This will ensure clarity and facilitate further use of the datasets in future research or applications.
