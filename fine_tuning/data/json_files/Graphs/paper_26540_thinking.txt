To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Binarized Graph Neural Network" by Hanchen Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and while it may not explicitly mention datasets, it sets the context for the experiments. The introduction often discusses the motivation and background, which may lead to mentions of datasets used in prior work.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experiment)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention three well-known citation network datasets: **Cora, Citeseer, and Pubmed**. I will take note of the details provided about these datasets, such as the number of nodes, edges, classes, and labeled nodes.

The paper includes a table summarizing the datasets, which is very useful. Here are the details I will extract:

1. **Cora Dataset**: 
   - Number of Nodes: 2708
   - Number of Edges: 5429
   - Number of Classes: 7
   - Number of Labeled Nodes: 140

2. **Citeseer Dataset**: 
   - Number of Nodes: 3327
   - Number of Edges: 4732
   - Number of Classes: 6
   - Number of Labeled Nodes: 120

3. **Pubmed Dataset**: 
   - Number of Nodes: 19717
   - Number of Edges: 44338
   - Number of Classes: 3
   - Number of Labeled Nodes: 60

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The paper cites the datasets as follows:

- For **Cora Dataset**:
  > Sen, P., Namata, G., Bilgic, M., Getoor, L., Galligher, B., & Eliassi-Rad, T. (2008). Collective classification in network data. AI Magazine, 29(3), 93-93.

- For **Citeseer Dataset**:
  > Sen, P., Namata, G., Bilgic, M., Getoor, L., Galligher, B., & Eliassi-Rad, T. (2008). Collective classification in network data. AI Magazine, 29(3), 93-93.

- For **Pubmed Dataset**:
  > Sen, P., Namata, G., Bilgic, M., Getoor, L., Galligher, B., & Eliassi-Rad, T. (2008). Collective classification in network data. AI Magazine, 29(3), 93-93.

Since all three datasets are cited from the same source, I will ensure to note that in my extraction.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described with its respective citation. This structured approach will help me accurately extract and present the datasets from the paper.
