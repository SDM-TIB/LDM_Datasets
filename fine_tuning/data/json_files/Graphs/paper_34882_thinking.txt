To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Sequential Contrastive Audio-Visual Learning" by Ioannis Tsiamas et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that retrieval experiments were conducted with the **VGGSound** and **Music datasets**, indicating that these are the datasets of interest.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for any additional context or details about these datasets. The introduction discusses the importance of audio-visual representation learning and mentions the use of large-scale video datasets, specifically highlighting the **VGGSound** dataset.

Then, I will look into the **experiments** section, particularly **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe their methodology and the datasets used. Here, they explicitly mention using the **VGGSound dataset** for training and testing, which contains 10-second clips from YouTube videos, and the **Music dataset** for out-of-distribution testing.

In the **setup** subsection of the experiments, the authors provide more details about the **VGGSound dataset**, stating that it consists of 153,000 videos for training and 13,000 for testing. They also mention that the **Music dataset** is used for evaluating retrieval in a challenging setting, with 1,908 test video clips extracted from a specific partition.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **VGGSound dataset**, the citation is:
   > Chen, H.; Xie, W.; Vedaldi, A.; and Zisserman, A. (2020). VGGSound: A Large-scale Audio-Visual Dataset. In International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing (ICASSP).

2. For the **Music dataset**, the citation is:
   > Zhao, H.; Gan, C.; Rouditchenko, A.; Vondrick, C.; McDermott, J.; and Torralba, A. (2018). The Sound of Pixels. In The European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV).

With this information gathered, I will now compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes the full citation as required. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
