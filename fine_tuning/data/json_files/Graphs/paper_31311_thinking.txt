To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Lumos: Heterogeneity-aware Federated Graph Learning over Decentralized Devices" by Qiying Pan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. In the abstract, the authors mention that they conducted extensive experiments, which suggests that datasets are involved. I will look for any specific names or descriptions of datasets in these sections.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section VIII), where the authors typically provide detailed information about the datasets used in their evaluations. Here, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, characteristics, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

In Section VIII, the authors describe two datasets used for their experiments:

1. **Facebook Dataset**: This dataset represents interactions among different Facebook pages, consisting of 22,470 vertices (Facebook pages) and 170,912 edges (mutual likes). It includes 4,714 vertex features derived from page descriptions and has 4 categories as labels.

2. **LastFM Dataset**: This dataset is derived from a music streaming service, containing 7,624 vertices (users) and 55,612 edges (following relationships). It includes 128 vertex features representing users' preferred musicians and has 18 classes as labels.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **Facebook Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Rozemberczki, B., Allen, C., & Sarkar, R. (2021). Multi-scale attributed node embedding. *Journal of Complex Networks*, 9(2), cnab014.

- For the **LastFM Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Rozemberczki, B., & Sarkar, R. (2020). Characteristic functions on graphs: Birds of a feather, from statistical descriptors to parametric models. In *Proceedings of the ACM CIKM* (pp. 1325â€“1334).

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
