To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning to Reweight for Graph Neural Network" by Zhengyu Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **experiments section**, the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for evaluation. I will look for any subsections that detail the datasets, as they often provide specific names, descriptions, and characteristics of the datasets.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention several datasets:

1. **Synthetic Datasets**: The authors describe the creation of synthetic datasets for graph classification tasks, specifically mentioning the use of a "wheel" motif as a causal structure for positive graphs and various motifs for negative graphs. However, these datasets are not formally cited as they are generated by the authors.

2. **Real-world Datasets**: The authors evaluate their method on three specific real-world datasets:
   - **COLLAB**: A social network dataset consisting of collaboration networks in physics. The dataset is split based on graph size, with training on smaller graphs and testing on larger ones.
   - **PROTEINS**: A dataset of protein structures, also split by graph size for training and testing.
   - **D&D**: Another protein dataset, which is similarly structured to PROTEINS.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper cites the following relevant works:

- For **COLLAB**, the citation is:
  > Knyazev, B., Taylor, G. W., & Amer, M. (2019). Understanding attention and generalization in graph neural networks. In NeurIPS.

- For **PROTEINS**, the citation is:
  > Wu, Z., Ramsundar, B., Feinberg, E. N., Gomes, J., Geniesse, C., Pappu, A. S., Leswing, K., & Pande, V. (2018). MoleculeNet: a benchmark for molecular machine learning. Chemical Science, 9(2), 513–530.

- For **D&D**, the citation is also included in the MoleculeNet reference, as it is part of the same benchmark.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and future reference.

In summary, I have extracted the following datasets from the paper:

1. **COLLAB**: A social network dataset for graph classification.
   - Citation: Knyazev, B., Taylor, G. W., & Amer, M. (2019). Understanding attention and generalization in graph neural networks. In NeurIPS.

2. **PROTEINS**: A dataset of protein structures for graph classification.
   - Citation: Wu, Z., Ramsundar, B., Feinberg, E. N., Gomes, J., Geniesse, C., Pappu, A. S., Leswing, K., & Pande, V. (2018). MoleculeNet: a benchmark for molecular machine learning. Chemical Science, 9(2), 513–530.

3. **D&D**: Another protein dataset for graph classification.
   - Citation: Wu, Z., Ramsundar, B., Feinberg, E. N., Gomes, J., Geniesse, C., Pappu, A. S., Leswing, K., & Pande, V. (2018). MoleculeNet: a benchmark for molecular machine learning. Chemical Science, 9(2), 513–530.

With this information, I am now ready to format the dataset entries as needed for further processing or review.
