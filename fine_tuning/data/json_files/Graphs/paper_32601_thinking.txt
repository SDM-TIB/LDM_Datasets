To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Label-efficient Contrastive Learning-based model for nuclei detection and classification in 3D Cardiovascular Immunofluorescent Images" by Nazanin Moradinasab et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on cardiovascular datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental results section**. Here, the authors explicitly mention three datasets used in their experiments:

1. **Cardiovascular dataset 1 (D1)**: This dataset contains 13 images, with 11 used for training and 2 for testing. The images vary in size along the z-axis (8 to 13). The authors mention that they extracted 256 Ã— 256-pixel patches with a 10% overlap, resulting in 370 patches for training and 74 for testing.

2. **Cardiovascular dataset 2 (D2)**: This dataset consists of 29 images used for further evaluation. The authors note that both datasets are derived from mouse models with advanced atherosclerotic lesions.

3. **CoNSeP dataset**: This dataset contains 24,332 nuclei from 41 whole slide images, with 26 images for training and 14 for testing. It includes 7 different classes of nuclei.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The paper does not provide explicit citations for the datasets, but I can infer that the CoNSeP dataset is likely referenced in the context of its original publication. 

The citation for the CoNSeP dataset is:
> Graham, S., Vu, Q.D., Raza, S.E.A., Azam, A., Tsang, Y.W., Kwak, J.T., Rajpoot, N. (2019). *Hover-net: Simultaneous segmentation and classification of nuclei in multi-tissue histology images*. Medical Image Analysis, 58, 101563.

For the cardiovascular datasets (D1 and D2), since they are not standard datasets with established citations, I will note them as internal datasets used by the authors without specific references.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their descriptions and citations into a structured format for further processing.
