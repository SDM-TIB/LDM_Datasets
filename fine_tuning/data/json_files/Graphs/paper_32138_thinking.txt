To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Perceptions and Realities of Text-to-Image Generation" by Jonas Oppenlaender et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and findings sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, but I will need to delve deeper into the methodology and findings to uncover any datasets used in the research.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the context of generative AI and its implications, but they do not mention specific datasets. I will move on to the **methodology section**, where the authors describe how they collected data through an online survey at the Researchersâ€™ Night event. Here, I will look for any mention of datasets used for the survey or any datasets referenced in the context of previous studies.

Next, I will examine the **findings section** to see if the authors reference any datasets that were analyzed or compared in their study. If they mention any datasets used in prior research or as part of their survey, I will note those down.

After identifying any datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets themselves.

If the authors refer to datasets from other studies, I will ensure to include those citations as well. For example, if they reference datasets like DALL-E, Midjourney, or Stable Diffusion, I will look for the original papers or documentation that describe these datasets and their usage.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets referenced in the paper.

Finally, I will organize the extracted information clearly and concisely, ready for any further processing or review.
