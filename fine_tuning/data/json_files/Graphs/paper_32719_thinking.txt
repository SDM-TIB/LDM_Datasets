To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Leveraging Negative Signals with Self-Attention for Sequential Music Recommendation" by Pavan Seshadri and Peter Knees, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and method sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study employs a dataset for training and evaluation, which is a good starting point.

Next, I will focus on **section 3.5 (Dataset)**, where the authors explicitly describe the dataset used in their study. Here, they mention the **Music Streaming Sessions Dataset (MSSD)**, which contains 160 million user sessions of consecutively listened songs. The details provided include the nature of the dataset, such as the pseudonymization of user data and the skip labels for tracks, which are crucial for understanding how the dataset is utilized in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The citation for the Music Streaming Sessions Dataset is:

- **Music Streaming Sessions Dataset**:
  > Brian Brost, Rishabh Mehrotra, and Tristan Jehan. 2019. The Music Streaming Sessions Dataset. In The World Wide Web Conference, WWW 2019, San Francisco, CA, USA, May 13-17, 2019, Ling Liu, Ryen W. White, Amin Mantrach, Fabrizio Silvestri, Julian J. McAuley, Ricardo Baeza-Yates, and Leila Zia (Eds.). ACM, 2594â€“2600. https://doi.org/10.1145/3308558.3313641

With this information, I can now summarize the dataset extracted from the paper:

1. **Music Streaming Sessions Dataset (MSSD)**: This dataset contains 160 million user sessions of 10 to 20 consecutively listened songs, with skip labels indicating user interactions.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that the full citation for the dataset is included as it is critical for proper attribution and reference.
