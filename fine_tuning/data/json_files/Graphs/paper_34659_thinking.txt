To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Building Continuous Quantum-Classical Bayesian Neural Networks for a Classical Clinical Dataset" by Alona Sakhnenko et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the use of a "classical medical dataset" and specifically references the **Breast Ultrasound Images (BreastMNIST)** dataset. This indicates that there is at least one dataset to extract.

Next, I will look for a dedicated section that discusses datasets in detail, which is often labeled as "Datasets" or similar. In this case, I will check **section IV (Method)**, where the authors describe their use-case and provide details about the BreastMNIST dataset. They mention that this dataset consists of breast ultrasound images classified into malignant and non-malignant categories, with a total of 780 samples.

Now, I will confirm the dataset's name and details:
1. **BreastMNIST Dataset**: The paper states that it consists of 28x28 images of breast ultrasound scans, classified into two categories (malignant and non-malignant). This dataset is particularly noted for its complexity due to the unbalanced nature of the samples.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the BreastMNIST dataset. The authors reference the dataset as follows:
- For **BreastMNIST**, the citation is:
  > Jiancheng Yang et al. “MedMNIST v2-A large-scale lightweight benchmark for 2D and 3D biomedical image classification”. In: Scientific Data 10.1 (2023), p. 41.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the BreastMNIST dataset.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for the BreastMNIST dataset, ensuring that it is ready for downstream processing or review.
