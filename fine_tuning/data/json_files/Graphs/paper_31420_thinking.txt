To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Identifiability Results for Multimodal Contrastive Learning" by Imant Daunhawer et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions empirical verification on a "complex multimodal dataset of image/text pairs," which indicates that a dataset is indeed used.

Next, I will examine **section 5.2 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe their experiments in detail. They mention using the **Causal3DIdent dataset** and extending it to create the **Multimodal3DIdent dataset**. The description of these datasets is crucial for understanding their structure and purpose.

1. **Causal3DIdent Dataset**: This dataset is used to measure and control the ground truth latent factors for generating complex observations. It involves rendering high-dimensional images based on various latent factors.

2. **Multimodal3DIdent Dataset**: This dataset is an extension of Causal3DIdent, generating textual descriptions from the latent factors. It includes shared information about the shape and position of objects, with additional complexity introduced by color and phrasing variations.

In the **References section**, I will look for full citations for these datasets. The paper cites the original sources for the datasets used:

- For **Causal3DIdent**, the citation is:
  > von KÃ¼gelgen, J., & Zimmermann, R. S. (2021). *Causal3DIdent: A dataset for causal representation learning*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML).

- For **CLEVR**, which is referenced in the context of generating textual descriptions, the citation is:
  > Johnson, J., Hariharan, B., van der Maaten, L., Fei-Fei, L., Zitnick, C. L., & Girshick, R. (2017). *CLEVR: A diagnostic dataset for compositional language and elementary visual reasoning*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR).

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
