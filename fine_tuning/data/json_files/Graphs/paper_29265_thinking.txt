To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Solving Disjunctive Temporal Networks with Uncertainty under Restricted Time-Based Controllability using Tree Search and Graph Neural Networks" by Kevin Osanlou et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses experiments conducted on a known benchmark, which suggests that there may be specific datasets referenced later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments** section. In this paper, the authors mention conducting experiments on a benchmark from Cimatti, Micheli, and Roveri (2016). This indicates that there is a specific dataset or benchmark being used, which I need to identify.

I will then check the **references section** to find the full citation for the benchmark mentioned. The reference to the benchmark is:
> Cimatti, A., Micheli, A., & Roveri, M. (2016). Dynamic controllability of disjunctive temporal networks: Validation and synthesis of executable strategies. In Thirtieth AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI), 3116â€“3123.

Since the paper does not explicitly list multiple datasets, I will focus on this benchmark as the primary dataset used in their experiments.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring to include the full citation as required. The final output will consist of the identified dataset along with its citation, formatted appropriately for review or further processing.
