To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Continuous System Dynamics from Irregularly-Sampled Partial Observations" by Zijie Huang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on "motion capture, spring system, and charged particle datasets," indicating that these datasets are crucial for understanding their research.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used. In this section, they mention three datasets:

1. **Particles connected by springs**: This dataset consists of simulated interactions among particles in a 2D box, where the trajectories are generated by solving motion PDEs. The authors specify that they generated 20,000 training samples and 5,000 testing samples.

2. **Charged particles**: Similar to the spring dataset, this dataset involves simulated interactions among charged particles. The authors also generated 20,000 training samples and 5,000 testing samples for this dataset.

3. **Motion capture data (CMU)**: This dataset is derived from the Carnegie Mellon University motion capture database, specifically focusing on walking sequences of a subject. The authors mention that they split the data into training and testing sets, with a total of 120 training samples and 27 testing samples.

Now, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **spring system and charged particles datasets**, the authors reference the work by Kipf et al. (2018):
  > Thomas Kipf, Ethan Fetaya, Kuan-Chieh Wang, Max Welling, and Richard Zemel. *Neural relational inference for interacting systems*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1802.04687, 2018.

- For the **CMU motion capture dataset**, the citation is:
  > CMU. *Carnegie-Mellon Motion Capture Database*. 2003. URL: http://mocap.cs.cmu.edu.

With this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described clearly and includes the full citation as required.

In summary, I will extract the following datasets:
1. Particles connected by springs - Citation: Kipf et al. (2018).
2. Charged particles - Citation: Kipf et al. (2018).
3. Motion capture data - Citation: CMU (2003).

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring all necessary details are included for each dataset.
