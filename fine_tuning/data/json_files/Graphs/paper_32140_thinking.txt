To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Securing Visually-Aware Recommender Systems: An Adversarial Image Reconstruction and Detection Framework" by Minglei Yin et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on **two real-world datasets**, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors typically provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used in their experiments. In this section, they explicitly mention the two datasets:

1. **Amazon Men Dataset**: This dataset consists of user interactions with products on Amazon, specifically targeting men's products. The statistics provided indicate that there are 34,244 users, 110,636 items, and 254,870 interactions.

2. **Amazon Fashion Dataset**: Similar to the Amazon Men dataset, this dataset focuses on fashion-related products. It includes 45,184 users, 166,270 items, and 358,003 interactions.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. However, since these datasets are derived from the Amazon Web store and are commonly used in research, they may not have formal citations like traditional datasets. Instead, I will note that they are based on the Amazon dataset, which is widely recognized in the research community.

Now, I will compile the information about each dataset, ensuring to include the relevant statistics and context for each.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format, ready for further processing or review.
