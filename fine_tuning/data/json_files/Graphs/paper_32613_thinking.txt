To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Wordle: A Microcosm of Life. Luck, Skill, Cheating, Loyalty, and Influence!" by James P. Dilger, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, results, and discussion sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study and hints at the data collected regarding Wordle players' first guesses from May 2023 to August 2023. This suggests that there is a dataset related to player behavior.

In the **introduction**, the author discusses the game mechanics and mentions that players can guess from a list of acceptable words. However, I need to look for specific datasets that were compiled or analyzed.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, where the author describes how they compiled data from WordleBot. The author mentions using the “Compare and view your recent scores” option of WordleBot to gather data on players' first guesses. This indicates that there is a dataset related to the first guesses of players, which is crucial for my extraction.

In the **results section**, the author presents findings based on the compiled data, including statistics on the popularity of starting words and the behavior of players. The author also provides a table (Table 1) that lists specific dates along with the corresponding first guesses, ranks, and share percentages for both normal and hard modes. This table is a key dataset that I need to extract.

Finally, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets or sources mentioned. The author cites various sources, including articles and studies related to Wordle and player behavior, which may provide additional context or data sources.

Now, I will compile the identified datasets along with their full citations:

1. **First Guess Data**: Compiled from WordleBot for the period of May 3 – August 31, 2023. This dataset includes the first guesses of players, their ranks, and share percentages.
   - Citation: Katz, J., & Conlon, M. (2022b). Introducing WordleBot 2.0. *The New York Times*. https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/17/upshot/wordle-wordlebot-new.html Accessed 08/28/2023

2. **Table 1 Data**: Contains specific dates, first guesses, ranks for normal and hard modes, and share percentages.
   - Citation: Dilger, J. P. (2023). Wordle: A Microcosm of Life. Luck, Skill, Cheating, Loyalty, and Influence! *[Research Paper]*.

After gathering this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for further processing, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its full citation.
