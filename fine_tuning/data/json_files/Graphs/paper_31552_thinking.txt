To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Associating Spatially-Consistent Grouping with Text-supervised Semantic Segmentation" by Yabo Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions achieving state-of-the-art performance on **Pascal VOC** and **Pascal Context** benchmarks, which suggests these datasets are used in the research.

Next, I will look for explicit mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this section, the authors state that they evaluate their method on **Pascal VOC** and **Pascal Context**, confirming that these are the datasets used for their experiments.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. **Pascal VOC**: The citation is:
   > Mark Everingham, Luc Van Gool, Christopher KI Williams, John Winn, and Andrew Zisserman. *The Pascal Visual Object Classes (VOC) Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 88(2):303–338, 2010.

2. **Pascal Context**: The citation is:
   > Roozbeh Mottaghi, Xianjie Chen, Xiaobai Liu, Nam-Gyu Cho, Seong-Whan Lee, Sanja Fidler, Raquel Urtasun, and Alan Yuille. *The Role of Context for Object Detection and Semantic Segmentation in the Wild*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 891–898, 2014.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

- **Pascal VOC**: A widely used dataset for object detection and segmentation tasks, containing images with annotated objects across 20 categories.
- **Pascal Context**: An extension of the Pascal VOC dataset that includes additional context annotations, providing a richer set of labels for semantic segmentation tasks.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes its full citation, ready for structured output or further processing.
