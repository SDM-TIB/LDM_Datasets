To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Message Intercommunication for Inductive Relation Reasoning" by Ke Liang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that extensive experiments were conducted on **twelve inductive benchmark datasets**, which indicates that there are multiple datasets to extract. I will note this down as a key point.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** within the paper. In this case, it appears that the datasets are discussed in **Section IV (Experiments)**, where the authors provide details about the datasets used for evaluation. I will carefully read through this section to identify the names and descriptions of each dataset.

Upon reviewing the experiments section, I find that the authors mention three specific datasets:

1. **WN18RR**: This dataset is used for inductive relation reasoning and contains a set of relations and entities structured in a knowledge graph format.

2. **FB15K-237**: Another dataset used for evaluating the inductive reasoning capabilities of the proposed model, consisting of a large number of entities and relations.

3. **NELL-995**: This dataset is also mentioned as part of the inductive benchmark datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access these datasets.

The citations I find are as follows:

- For **WN18RR**, the citation is:
  > Dettmers, T., Minervini, P., Stenetorp, P., & Riedel, S. (2018). Convolutional 2D knowledge graph embeddings. In Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence. New Orleans, Louisiana, USA: AAAI Press, pp. 1811–1818.

- For **FB15K-237**, the citation is:
  > Toutanova, K., Chen, D., Pantel, P., Poon, H., Choudhury, P., & Gamon, M. (2015). Representing text for joint embedding of text and knowledge bases. In Proceedings of the 2015 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing. Lisbon, Portugal: Association for Computational Linguistics, pp. 1499–1509.

- For **NELL-995**, the citation is:
  > Xiong, W., Hoang, T., & Wang, W. Y. (2017). Deeppath: A reinforcement learning method for knowledge graph reasoning. In Proceedings of the 2017 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing. Copenhagen: Association for Computational Linguistics, pp. 564–573.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This will ensure that all relevant details are captured accurately and can be easily referenced in future work.
