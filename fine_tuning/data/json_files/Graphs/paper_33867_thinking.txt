To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Leveraging Diverse Modeling Contexts with Collaborating Learning for Neural Machine Translation" by Yusheng Liao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that extensive experiments were conducted on four widely used benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental setup section** where the authors detail the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention four specific datasets:

1. **WMT14 English-German (EN-DE)**: This dataset contains 3.9 million bilingual training pairs.
2. **WMT16 English-Romanian (EN-RO)**: This dataset consists of 610,000 bilingual training pairs.
3. **IWSLT14 English-German (EN-DE)**: This dataset includes 160,000 bilingual training pairs.
4. **IWSLT15 English-Vietnamese (EN-VI)**: This dataset has 130,000 bilingual training pairs.

The authors also mention that they used pre-processed pipelines provided in the fairseq toolkit for the WMT14 and IWSLT14 datasets, which is useful for understanding the context of the datasets.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. However, since these datasets are commonly used benchmarks in the field of machine translation, they may not have specific citations in the references. Instead, I will note the general sources or organizations associated with these datasets:

- **WMT14 English-German**: The dataset is part of the Workshop on Machine Translation (WMT) and can be referenced as:
  > WMT14 English-German dataset. Available at: http://www.statmt.org/wmt14/translation-task.html

- **WMT16 English-Romanian**: Similarly, this dataset is also part of the WMT and can be referenced as:
  > WMT16 English-Romanian dataset. Available at: http://www.statmt.org/wmt16/translation-task.html

- **IWSLT14 English-German**: This dataset is part of the International Workshop on Spoken Language Translation (IWSLT) and can be referenced as:
  > IWSLT14 English-German dataset. Available at: https://sites.google.com/site/iwsltevaluation2014/

- **IWSLT15 English-Vietnamese**: This dataset is also part of the IWSLT and can be referenced as:
  > IWSLT15 English-Vietnamese dataset. Available at: https://sites.google.com/site/iwsltevaluation2015/

Now that I have identified the datasets and their respective citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
