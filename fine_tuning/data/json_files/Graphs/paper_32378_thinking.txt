To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Count, Decode and Fetch: A New Approach to Handwritten Chinese Character Error Correction" by Pengfei Hu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors focus on handwritten Chinese character error correction, which suggests that datasets related to handwritten characters may be involved.

Next, I will examine **section 6 (Experiments)**, where the authors discuss the datasets used for their experiments. They mention utilizing a dataset of misspelled handwritten Chinese characters introduced in a previous work. Specifically, they state that the training set comprises 5,000 categories of right characters and the test set includes 2,000 categories of seen right characters and 570 categories of unseen misspelled characters. This section provides crucial information about the datasets used.

The authors also mention the total number of samples, which includes 400,000 right character samples and 11,400 misspelled character samples. They categorize the misspelled samples based on error types, which further emphasizes the dataset's structure.

Now, I will look into the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper references previous works that introduced the datasets:

1. For the dataset of misspelled handwritten Chinese characters, the citation is:
   > Y. Li, J. Du, J. Zhang, C. Wu, A tree-structure analysis network on handwritten Chinese character error correction, IEEE Transactions on Multimedia (2022).

2. For the Chinese Text in the Wild (CTW) dataset, the citation is:
   > T.-L. Yuan, Z. Zhu, K. Xu, C.-J. Li, T.-J. Mu, S.-M. Hu, A large Chinese text dataset in the wild, Journal of Computer Science and Technology 34 (2019) 509–521.

3. For the HWDB1.0-1.1 dataset, the citation is:
   > C.-L. Liu, F. Yin, D.-H. Wang, Q.-F. Wang, Online and offline handwritten Chinese character recognition: benchmarking on new databases, Pattern Recognition 46 (1) (2013) 155–162.

4. For the ICDAR 2013 dataset, the citation is:
   > F. Yin, Q.-F. Wang, X.-Y. Zhang, C.-L. Liu, ICDAR 2013 Chinese handwriting recognition competition, in: 2013 12th International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition, IEEE, 2013, pp. 1464–1470.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This structured approach will help ensure that I accurately capture all relevant datasets and their citations from the paper.
