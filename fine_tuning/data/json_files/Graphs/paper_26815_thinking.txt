To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Accelerating Graph Sampling for Graph Machine Learning using GPUs" by Abhinav Jangda et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions, but it may not detail specific datasets. The introduction often outlines the context and significance of the research, which might include references to datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments and evaluation sections**. These sections typically contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the experiments. I will look for any tables or figures that summarize the datasets, including their characteristics such as the number of nodes, edges, and any specific properties relevant to the study.

In the paper, I notice a **Table 3** that lists several datasets used in the evaluation. The datasets mentioned are:

1. **Protein-Protein Interactions (PPI)**: This dataset contains 50,000 nodes and 1.4 million edges, with an average degree of 28.0.
2. **com-Orkut**: This dataset has 3 million nodes and 117 million edges, with an average degree of 39.0.
3. **cit-Patents**: This dataset consists of 3.77 million nodes and 16.5 million edges, with an average degree of 4.37.
4. **soc-LiveJournal1**: This dataset contains 4.8 million nodes and 68.9 million edges, with an average degree of 14.3.
5. **com-Friendster**: This dataset has 65.6 million nodes and 1.8 billion edges, with an average degree of 27.4.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The paper cites the Stanford Network Analysis Project (SNAP) as the source for these datasets. The citation for SNAP is:

> Jure Leskovec and Andrej Krevl. *SNAP Datasets: Stanford Large Network Dataset Collection*. http://snap.stanford.edu/data.

Now, I will compile the dataset information along with their citations. Each dataset will be documented with its name, description, and citation.

Finally, I will ensure that the dataset entries are clear and concise, ready for any further processing or review.
