To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Modeling Heterogeneous Relations across Multiple Modes for Potential Crowd Flow Prediction" by Qiang Zhou et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments on real-world datasets, which indicates that datasets are present.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used for their experiments. They mention constructing a benchmark with three real-world flow datasets collected from NYC OpenData. I will extract the details of each dataset mentioned:

1. **NYC Turnstile Usage of Subway Stations**: This dataset includes turnstile usage counts from NYC subway stations, with records containing information such as station-ID, turnstile-ID, record time, entries value, and exits value.

2. **NYC Citi Bike**: This dataset consists of bike-sharing transaction records from the NYC Bike Sharing System, including details like bike pick-up station, bike drop-off station, pick-up time, drop-off time, and trip duration.

3. **NYC Taxi**: This dataset contains taxi trip records, including information such as pick-up time, drop-off time, pick-up region, drop-off region, and trip distance.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. However, since these datasets are publicly available and not from traditional academic sources, I will provide the relevant details as follows:

- For **NYC Turnstile Usage of Subway Stations**, the citation is:
  > NYC Metropolitan Transportation Authority. *Turnstile Usage Data*. Available at: [NYC OpenData](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/).

- For **NYC Citi Bike**, the citation is:
  > NYC Citi Bike. *Citi Bike Trip Data*. Available at: [NYC OpenData](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/).

- For **NYC Taxi**, the citation is:
  > NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission. *Taxi Trip Data*. Available at: [NYC OpenData](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/).

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
