To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Self-Supervised Contrastive Learning for Cross-Domain Hyperspectral Image Representation" by Hyungtae Lee and Heesung Kwon, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses a self-supervised learning framework for hyperspectral images, but it does not specify datasets. The introduction mentions the challenges of labeling hyperspectral images, hinting at the use of multiple datasets but does not name them yet.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used. They state that they used six hyperspectral images, which are listed in **Table 2**. The table provides the names of the datasets along with details about the sensors used, the number of bands, and the number of labeled samples.

The six datasets mentioned are:

1. **Indian Pines**: Acquired using the AVIRIS sensor, it has 200 bands, 21,025 total samples, and 9,545 labeled samples.
2. **Salinas**: Acquired using the ROSIS sensor, it has 204 bands, 111,104 total samples, and 54,129 labeled samples.
3. **KSC**: Acquired using the Hyperion sensor, it has 176 bands, 314,368 total samples, and 5,211 labeled samples.
4. **Pavia**: Acquired using the ROSIS sensor, it has 102 bands, 783,640 total samples, and 148,152 labeled samples.
5. **Pavia University**: Also acquired using the ROSIS sensor, it has 103 bands, 207,400 total samples, and 42,776 labeled samples.
6. **Botswana**: Acquired using the Hyperion sensor, it has 145 bands, 377,856 total samples, and 3,248 labeled samples.

Now, I will check the **References section** for full citations of these datasets. The paper does not provide specific citations for each dataset, but I can infer that the datasets are commonly used in hyperspectral image classification research. However, I will still note the original papers or sources where these datasets can typically be found:

- **Indian Pines**:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
