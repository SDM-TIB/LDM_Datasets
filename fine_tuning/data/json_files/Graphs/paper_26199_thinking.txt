To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Iterative Hard Thresholding for Low CP-rank Tensor Models" by Rachel Grotheer et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** of the paper to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and it may mention datasets used for empirical validation.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 3) where the authors typically describe the datasets used in their experiments. I will look for specific names of datasets, descriptions of their contents, and any relevant details such as the number of samples, dimensions, or characteristics that define the datasets.

In this paper, the authors mention using **synthetic data** and **real data** for their experiments. I will note the following datasets:

1. **Synthetic Low-Rank Tensors**: The authors created synthetic tensors with i.i.d. standard normal entries for testing the performance of their method. While this dataset is generated rather than sourced from an external repository, it is important to document the methodology used to create it.

2. **Real Data from Color Images**: The authors used RGB images as tensors in R^n1×n2×3, where the third mode represents the three color channels. They mention that these images are low-rank by construction, but they do not provide specific citations for the images used.

3. **Real Data from Grayscale Video**: The authors also utilized tensors representing video data, where each frame is treated as a slice of the tensor. Again, specific datasets or sources are not cited, but the methodology is described.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to see if any of the datasets mentioned have associated citations. However, since the synthetic dataset is generated and the real datasets are not sourced from specific repositories, I will note that there are no formal citations for these datasets.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the names of the datasets, descriptions, and any relevant details, even if they do not have formal citations. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.

In summary, I will extract the following datasets:
- Synthetic Low-Rank Tensors (no citation)
- Real Data from Color Images (no citation)
- Real Data from Grayscale Video (no citation)

I will ensure that the descriptions are clear and concise, reflecting the information provided in the paper.
