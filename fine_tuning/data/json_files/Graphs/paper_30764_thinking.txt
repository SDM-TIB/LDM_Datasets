To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Pose-disentangled Contrastive Learning for Self-supervised Facial Representation" by Yuanyuan Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the proposed method was evaluated on various downstream facial understanding tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved. 

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for training and evaluation. In this section, they mention using the **VoxCeleb1** and **VoxCeleb2** datasets for training, which are crucial for the self-supervised learning aspect of their work. 

I will also note the specific details provided about these datasets:
- **VoxCeleb1**: Contains 299,085 video clips of around 7,000 speakers.
- **VoxCeleb2**: Similar in nature, used in conjunction with VoxCeleb1.

Additionally, the authors mention using several datasets for evaluation in different tasks:
1. **FER-2013**: Contains 28,709 training and 3,589 testing images for facial expression recognition.
2. **RAF-DB**: A subset of 12,271 training and 3,068 testing images for basic emotion recognition.
3. **LFW (Labeled Faces in the Wild)**: Comprises 13,233 face images from 5,749 identities.
4. **CPLFW (Cross-Pose LFW)**: Includes 3,000 positive face pairs with pose differences.
5. **DISFA**: A dataset for facial action unit detection with 130,000 AU-labelled frames.
6. **300W-LP**: Used for pose regression, containing 122,450 images.
7. **AFLW2000**: Contains 2,000 images for pose estimation.
8. **BU-3DFE**: A dataset for head pose estimation with 14,112 images.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access these datasets.

The citations I will extract include:

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited for future reference.
