To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Detection and Recovery Against Deep Neural Network Fault Injection Attacks Based on Contrastive Learning" by Chenan Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their framework using the **CIFAR-10 dataset**, which is a clear indication that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will look closely at the **experiments section** (section 3) to gather more details about the dataset. In section 3.1 (Experimental Setup), the authors explicitly state that they evaluated their CFDR framework using a **ResNet-18 model trained with the SimCLR framework on the CIFAR-10 dataset**. This confirms that CIFAR-10 is the primary dataset used for their experiments.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the CIFAR-10 dataset. The CIFAR-10 dataset is a well-known dataset in the machine learning community, and its citation is typically included in the literature. However, in this paper, the authors do not provide a specific citation for CIFAR-10, as it is widely recognized. Therefore, I will use the standard citation for CIFAR-10, which is:

- **CIFAR-10 Dataset**: 
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. *CIFAR-10: The CIFAR-10 dataset of images*. 2009. Available at: https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the findings:

1. **CIFAR-10 Dataset**: The authors used this dataset to evaluate their CFDR framework, which consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class.

With this information, I can now prepare to create the dataset entry in the required format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the CIFAR-10 dataset as it is crucial for proper attribution.
