To extract datasets from the research paper titled "node2vec: Scalable Feature Learning for Networks" by Aditya Grover and Jure Leskovec, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the evaluation of node2vec on "several real-world networks from diverse domains," which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4), where the authors describe their empirical evaluations. Here, they explicitly mention three datasets used for multi-label classification tasks:

1. **BlogCatalog**: This dataset is a network of social relationships among bloggers, containing 10,312 nodes, 333,983 edges, and 39 different labels.

2. **Protein-Protein Interactions (PPI)**: This dataset is a subgraph of the PPI network for Homo Sapiens, consisting of 3,890 nodes, 76,584 edges, and 50 different labels.

3. **Wikipedia**: This dataset is a co-occurrence network of words from the first million bytes of the Wikipedia dump, with 4,777 nodes, 184,812 edges, and 40 different labels.

In addition to these datasets, the authors also mention using the **Facebook** dataset and the **arXiv ASTRO-PH** dataset for link prediction tasks. The Facebook dataset has 4,039 nodes and 88,234 edges, while the arXiv dataset has 18,722 nodes and 198,110 edges.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **BlogCatalog**:
  > Zafarani, R., & Liu, H. (2009). Social computing data repository at ASU. 

- For **PPI**:

- For **arXiv ASTRO-PH**:

With these citations in hand, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
