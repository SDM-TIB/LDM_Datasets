To extract datasets from the research paper titled "3DP3: 3D Scene Perception via Probabilistic Programming" by Nishad Gothoskar et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the framework and its capabilities, but I need to look for specific datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 6), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, they mention using the **YCB-Video dataset** and the **YCB-Challenging dataset**. I will take note of these datasets and look for detailed descriptions.

1. **YCB-Video Dataset**: The authors describe it as a standard robotics dataset for training and evaluating 3D perception systems, consisting of 2,949 real RGB-D images featuring 21 YCB objects collected from various scenes.

2. **YCB-Challenging Dataset**: This is a synthetic dataset created by the authors, consisting of 2,000 RGB-D images across four categories of challenging scenes, including single objects, stacked objects, partial views, and partially occluded objects.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **YCB-Video dataset**, the citation is:
  > Berk Calli, Aaron Walsman, Arjun Singh, Siddhartha Srinivasa, Pieter Abbeel, and Aaron M. Dollar. *Benchmarking in Manipulation Research: Using the Yale-CMU-Berkeley Object and Model Set*. IEEE Robotics Automation Magazine, 22(3):36â€“52, 2015.

- For the **YCB-Challenging dataset**, the citation is:
  > This dataset is introduced in the paper itself, and the authors do not provide a separate citation for it. However, it is important to note that it is a synthetic dataset created for the purposes of their experiments.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their descriptions and citations into a structured format for further use. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the relevant information about each dataset used in the research.
