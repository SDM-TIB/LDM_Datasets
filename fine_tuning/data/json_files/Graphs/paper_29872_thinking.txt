To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Features Based Adaptive Augmentation for Graph Contrastive Learning" by Adnan Ali and Jinlong Li, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often highlights the datasets used for validation or experimentation.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss their method and its application to various benchmark datasets. I will look for any specific names or descriptions of datasets that are mentioned in this section.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments and Results)**, particularly **subsection 4.1 (Dataset)**, where the authors provide a table summarizing the statistics of the classification benchmark datasets used in their work. This section is likely to contain the most relevant information regarding the datasets, including their names, number of nodes, features, edges, and classes.

The datasets listed in the table include:

1. **Cora**: A citation network dataset with 2,708 nodes, 1,433 features, 10,556 edges, and 7 classes.
2. **CiteSeer**: Another citation network dataset with 3,327 nodes, 3,703 features, 9,104 edges, and 6 classes.
3. **WikiCS**: A dataset with 11,701 nodes, 300 features, 216,123 edges, and 10 classes.
4. **Amazon-Computers**: A dataset with 13,752 nodes, 767 features, 491,722 edges, and 10 classes.
5. **Amazon-Photos**: A dataset with 7,650 nodes, 745 features, 238,162 edges, and 8 classes.
6. **Coauthor-CS**: A dataset with 18,333 nodes, 6,805 features, 163,788 edges, and 15 classes.
7. **Coauthor-Actor**: A dataset with 34,493 nodes, 8,415 features, 495,924 edges, and 5 classes.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations of these datasets. However, the paper does not provide specific citations for the datasets used, as they are commonly known benchmark datasets in the field of graph representation learning.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective details, ensuring to include the dataset names and their statistics as outlined in the paper. The full citations for the datasets are not provided, but I will note that they are widely recognized datasets in the research community.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset information in a structured format for further processing or review.
