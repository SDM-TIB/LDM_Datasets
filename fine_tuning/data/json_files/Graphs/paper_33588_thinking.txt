To extract datasets from the research paper titled "HOPE: Hybrid-granularity Ordinal Prototype Learning for Progression Prediction of Mild Cognitive Impairment" by Chenhui Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that experimental results were obtained from the **internal ADNI** and **external NACC datasets**, indicating that these are the primary datasets used in the study.

Next, I will look for more detailed descriptions of these datasets in the **experiments section**. In this section, the authors provide a brief overview of both datasets:

1. **ADNI (Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative)**: This dataset includes various types of data such as MRI and PET images, genetics, cognitive tests, and biomarkers. It is a well-known resource for Alzheimer's research.

2. **NACC (National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center)**: This dataset is built from data collected from multiple Alzheimer’s Disease Research Centers across the US, focusing on various aspects of Alzheimer's disease.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and further exploration of the datasets:

- For **ADNI**, the citation is:
  > Petersen, R. C., et al. "Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI): Clinical characterization." *Neurology*, vol. 74, no. 3, pp. 201–209, 2010.

- For **NACC**, the citation is:
  > Beekly, D. L., et al. "The National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center (NACC) database: an Alzheimer disease database." *Alzheimer Dis. Assoc. Dis.*, vol. 18, no. 4, pp. 270–277, 2004.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, which is essential for reproducibility and further research in the field.
