To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Can Semantic Labels Assist Self-Supervised Visual Representation Learning?" by Longhui Wei et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and the introduction often outlines the datasets used for evaluation or comparison.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of semantic labels in self-supervised learning and mention that they evaluate their method on various datasets. This indicates that there are datasets involved, but I need to find their specific names.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they explicitly mention that they pre-train their method on **ImageNet-1K** and evaluate it on four datasets: **PASCAL VOC**, **COCO**, **LVIS**, and **Cityscapes**. Each dataset is briefly described, including its purpose and characteristics.

1. **ImageNet-1K**: A large-scale classification dataset containing approximately 1.28 million images across 1000 classes. It is widely used for pre-training models in computer vision.

2. **PASCAL VOC**: A dataset for object detection and segmentation tasks, which includes bounding box annotations and segmentation masks.

3. **COCO**: The Common Objects in Context dataset, which is used for multiple tasks, including object detection, instance segmentation, and keypoint detection.

4. **LVIS**: A long-tailed instance segmentation dataset that contains over 1000 categories, designed to evaluate models on a diverse set of objects.

5. **Cityscapes**: A dataset focused on semantic urban scene understanding, primarily used for semantic segmentation tasks in street scenes.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

Now that I have gathered the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
