To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep-Learning-Based Clustering of OCT Images for Biomarker Discovery in Age-Related Macular Degeneration (PINNACLE Study Report 4)" by Robbie Holland et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study involves a large dataset of retinal optical coherence tomography (OCT) images, which suggests that there is a dataset to extract.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the need for new imaging biomarkers for age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and mention the use of a dataset of OCT images. This reinforces the idea that a specific dataset is central to their research.

Next, I will focus on **section 2.1 (OCT dataset)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset used in their study. They mention that the dataset consists of **46,496 OCT images** collected from **6,236 eyes of 3,456 patients** over an eight-year period as part of the PINNACLE project. This section provides crucial details about the dataset, including its size and the patient demographics.

The authors also reference the **PINNACLE study** and provide a ClinicalTrials.gov identifier (NCT04269304), which is important for citation purposes. They mention that the dataset was collected under ethical guidelines, which adds credibility to the dataset's use.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the PINNACLE study. The citation is as follows:
> Sutton J, Menten MJ, Riedl S, et al. *Developing and validating a multivariable prediction model which predicts progression of intermediate to late age-related macular degeneration—the PINNACLE trial protocol*. Eye. 2022:1–9.

With this information, I can summarize the dataset extracted from the paper:

1. **OCT Dataset**: A dataset consisting of 46,496 retinal OCT images collected from 6,236 eyes of 3,456 patients as part of the PINNACLE study.

Now, I will compile the dataset entry with the full citation into a structured format for further processing. This ensures that I have accurately captured the dataset's details and its source.
