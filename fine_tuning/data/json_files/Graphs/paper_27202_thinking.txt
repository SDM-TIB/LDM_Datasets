To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Temporal Contrastive Graph Learning for Video Action Recognition and Retrieval" by Yang Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the proposed method is evaluated on "three action recognition datasets," which indicates that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Experimental Setting)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention:

1. **UCF101**: This dataset is described as containing 101 action classes with 9.5k videos for training and 3.5k videos for testing.
2. **HMDB51**: This dataset consists of 51 action classes and includes 3.4k videos for training and 1.4k videos for testing.
3. **Kinetics-400**: A large-scale dataset with 400 action classes and approximately 306k videos, where the authors use the training split (around 240k videos) for pre-training.

To ensure accuracy, I will check the **References section** for the full citations of these datasets:

- For **UCF101**, the citation is:
  > Khurram Soomro, Amir Roshan Zamir, and Mubarak Shah. *UCF101: A dataset of 101 human actions classes from videos in the wild*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1212.0402, 2012.

- For **HMDB51**, the citation is:
  > Hildegard Kuehne, Hueihan Jhuang, Estíbaliz Garrote, Tomaso Poggio, and Thomas Serre. *HMDB: A large video database for human motion recognition*. In 2011 International Conference on Computer Vision, pages 2556–2563. IEEE, 2011.

- For **Kinetics-400**, the citation is:
  > Will Kay, Joao Carreira, Karen Simonyan, Brian Zhang, Chloe Hillier, Sudheendra Vijayanarasimhan, Fabio Viola, Tim Green, Trevor Back, Paul Natsev, et al. *The Kinetics human action video dataset*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1705.06950, 2017.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will summarize the information for each dataset clearly, ensuring that the full citations are included.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for easy reference and further processing.
