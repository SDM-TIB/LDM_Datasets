To extract the datasets mentioned in the paper titled "2nd Place Solution to Google Landmark Retrieval 2021" by Yuqi Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, method, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the Google Landmark Retrieval 2021 Competition, which suggests that there are datasets involved, likely related to landmark images.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the techniques used for the landmark retrieval task and reference the Google Landmark Dataset v2 (GLDv2). This indicates that this dataset is likely central to their work.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **method section**. In **section 3.1 (Training set construction)**, the authors describe the GLDv2 dataset, noting that it has both a clean version and a full version. They also mention the number of samples and labels for different subsets of the dataset, which is crucial information.

The paper specifies the following datasets:

1. **GLDv2 Clean Dataset**: This dataset includes clean images for landmark retrieval. The authors mention that it contains 1,580,470 samples with 81,313 labels.

2. **GLDv2 Full Dataset**: This dataset contains both clean and noisy images, totaling 4,825,830 samples with 203,094 labels.

3. **GLDv2 c2x Dataset**: This dataset is an expanded version of the clean dataset that includes noisy images, resulting in 4,132,914 samples with 203,094 labels.

4. **GLDv2 Index Set**: This set is used for indexing during the retrieval process, sharing many common IDs with the full dataset.

In the **experiments section**, the authors confirm that they used the GLDv2 dataset for their experiments, which reinforces its importance in their study.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to retrieve the full citations for these datasets. The relevant citation for the GLDv2 dataset is:

- For **Google Landmarks Dataset v2 (GLDv2)**, the citation is:
  > Tobias Weyand, Andre Araujo, Bingyi Cao, and Jack Sim. *Google landmarks dataset v2 - a large-scale benchmark for instance-level recognition and retrieval*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pages 2575â€“2584, 2020.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all details are accurately represented for future reference or processing.
