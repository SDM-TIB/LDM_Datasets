To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ASWT-SGNN: Adaptive Spectral Wavelet Transform-based Self-Supervised Graph Neural Network" by Ruyue Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the research context and any datasets that might be mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted extensive experiments on eight benchmark datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any relevant sections that discuss the datasets used in the experiments. In this paper, the **Experiments** section provides a clear overview of the datasets utilized. The authors explicitly mention eight benchmark datasets used for evaluation, which are:

1. **Cora**: A citation network dataset consisting of 2,708 nodes (papers) and 5,429 edges (citations).
2. **CiteSeer**: Another citation network with 3,327 nodes and 4,732 edges.
3. **PubMed**: A dataset with 19,717 nodes and 44,338 edges, also representing citation relationships.
4. **Amazon-Photo**: A co-purchase dataset with 7,650 nodes and 119,081 edges.
5. **Amazon-Computers**: Similar to Amazon-Photo, this dataset has 13,752 nodes and 245,861 edges.
6. **Coauthor-CS**: An academic network dataset with 18,333 nodes and 81,894 edges, representing co-authorship relationships.
7. **Coauthor-Physics**: Another academic network with 34,493 nodes and 247,962 edges.
8. **WikiCS**: A Wikipedia-based dataset with 11,701 nodes and 216,123 edges.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The paper cites the sources for the datasets as follows:

- For **Cora, CiteSeer, and PubMed**:
  > Yang, Z., Cohen, W., & Salakhudinov, R. (2016). Revisiting semi-supervised learning with graph embeddings. In International conference on machine learning (pp. 40–48). PMLR.

- For **Amazon-Photo and Amazon-Computers**:

- For **Coauthor-CS and Coauthor-Physics**:
  > Suresh, S., Li, P., Hao, C., & Neville, J. (2021). Adversarial graph augmentation to improve graph contrastive learning. Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 34, 15920–15933.

- For **WikiCS**:
  > Mernyei, P., & Cangea, C. (2020). Wiki-CS: A Wikipedia-based benchmark for graph neural networks. arXiv:2007.02901.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant information regarding the datasets used in the research.
