To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fermi-Bose Machine" by Mingshan Xie et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the application of the proposed method to the **MNIST benchmark dataset**, which indicates that this dataset is relevant to the research.

Next, I will check the **experiments section** to find more details about the datasets used. In this section, the authors mention that they tested their model on the **MNIST dataset**, which is a well-known dataset for handwritten digit recognition. They describe how the dataset consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images of handwritten digits.

I will also look for any additional datasets mentioned in the **results or discussion sections**. However, the paper primarily focuses on the MNIST dataset for its experiments, and no other datasets are explicitly mentioned.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citation for the MNIST dataset. The citation for the MNIST dataset is as follows:
> Yann LeCun. *The MNIST database of handwritten digits*. Retrieved from http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist.

With this information, I will summarize the dataset details:

1. **MNIST Dataset**: This dataset consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images of handwritten digits (0-9). It is widely used for benchmarking machine learning algorithms in image classification tasks.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format for further processing or review. This process ensures that I have accurately captured the relevant datasets and their citations from the research paper.
