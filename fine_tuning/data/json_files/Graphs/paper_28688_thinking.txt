To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Separated Contrastive Learning for Organ-at-Risk and Gross-Tumor-Volume Segmentation with Limited Annotation" by Jiacheng Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on a public dataset and two private datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, they mention three datasets:

1. **PDDCA**: This is a public dataset consisting of 32 Head & Neck CT scans with six OAR segmentation labels. The authors note that while the dataset is small and lacks consistent annotations, it is still relevant for their experiments.

2. **LungOAR**: This is a clinical dataset collected from a local hospital, containing 97 volumes aimed at segmenting the esophagus of lung cancer. The authors describe the annotation process, which involved both junior and senior radiologists to ensure accuracy.

3. **NasoGTV**: Another clinical dataset consisting of 93 volumes, this dataset is focused on segmenting the GTV of nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Similar to LungOAR, the annotation process was conducted by local radiologists.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **PDDCA**:
  > Raudaschl, P. F., Zaffino, P., Sharp, G. C., Spadea, M. F., Chen, A., Dawant, B. M., Albrecht, T., Gass, T., Langguth, C., Luthi, M., et al. (2017). Evaluation of segmentation methods on head and neck CT: auto-segmentation challenge 2015. *Medical Physics*, 44(5), 2020-2036.

- For **LungOAR**: 
  > This dataset does not have a specific citation provided in the paper, but it is mentioned that it was collected from a local hospital with annotations by radiologists.

- For **NasoGTV**: 
  > Similar to LungOAR, this dataset does not have a specific citation but is noted to have been annotated by local radiologists.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This will ensure that all relevant details are captured and properly attributed.
