To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Effective Image Manipulation Detection with Proposal Contrastive Learning" by Yuyuan Zeng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that "Extensive experiments among several standard datasets demonstrate that our PCL can be a general module to obtain consistent improvement." This indicates that multiple datasets are used, prompting me to look for specific names and details.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section IV) where the authors describe their experimental settings and the datasets used. In this section, they mention several datasets explicitly:

1. **COCO synthetic dataset**: This dataset is created from the COCO dataset by splicing objects from one image into another. It contains 11,000 manipulated images with ground-truth tampered masks.

2. **NIST16**: A dataset from the Nimble Challenge Evaluation 2016, which includes 404 images for fine-tuning and 160 images for evaluation, with masks provided to indicate manipulation.

3. **CASIA**: This dataset includes splice and copy-move tampered images, with 5,123 images for fine-tuning and 921 images for evaluation.

4. **COVERAGE**: A smaller dataset consisting of 75 images for fine-tuning and 25 images for evaluation, specifically for copy-move tampering.

5. **Columbia**: A dataset containing 180 splicing images, with ground-truth masks provided.

6. **IMD20**: This dataset consists of 2,010 real-life manipulated images collected from the internet, covering various manipulation types.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets mentioned are as follows:

Now that I have gathered the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
