To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning to Schedule Job-Shop Problems: Representation and Policy Learning Using Graph Neural Network and Reinforcement Learning" by Junyoung Park et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for evaluation. 

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors often discuss the context of their research and may reference datasets that are commonly used in the field. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or benchmarks.

Then, I will examine the **methodology section**, particularly any subsections that detail the experimental setup. This section is likely to contain specific information about the datasets used, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **experiments section** to confirm that the datasets mentioned are indeed used in the experiments and to gather any additional details about their application.

Once I have identified the datasets, I will refer to the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets themselves.

For this paper, I anticipate that the authors may have used benchmark datasets for job-shop scheduling problems, which are common in this area of research. I will look for specific names of datasets, such as "ORB instances," "ABZ instances," or others that may be mentioned.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will include the dataset name, a brief description, and the citation formatted according to academic standards.

By following these steps, I will ensure a thorough extraction of datasets from the paper, providing clear and accurate documentation for each one.
