To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Temporal Supervised Contrastive Learning for Modeling Patient Risk Progression" by Shahriar Noroozizadeh et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors demonstrate their approach on two datasets: **MIMIC-III** and **ADNI**. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for the experiments.

Next, I will look for detailed descriptions of these datasets in the **experiments section**. In section 4.2, the authors provide specific information about the datasets used:

1. **MIMIC-III Dataset**: This dataset is described as containing time series data of septic patients, with a total of 18,354 patients identified based on Sepsis-3 criteria. The prediction task involves ICU visit mortality, where the final outcome label is known. The authors reference the original source of the dataset:
   > Johnson, A. E. W., Pollard, T. J., Shen, L., et al. (2018). The MIMIC-III Clinical Database. *PhysioNet*.

2. **ADNI Dataset**: This dataset is used to track the progression of Alzheimer’s disease, encompassing 11,651 hospital visits across 1,346 patients. The prediction task involves multiclass classification of cognitive impairment status. The authors cite the original source of the dataset:
   > Petersen, R. C., Aisen, P., Beckett, L. A., et al. (2010). Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). *Neurology*.

After identifying the datasets, I will ensure to retrieve the full citations for both datasets from the references section of the paper. 

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations as required. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets utilized in the research.
