To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ADiag: Graph Neural Network Based Diagnosis of Alzheimer’s Disease" by Vishnu Ram Sampathkumar, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the development of a novel method for diagnosing Alzheimer's Disease using Graph Neural Networks, which suggests that there may be datasets involved in the research.

In the **introduction**, the author discusses the limitations of current diagnostic methods and the need for quantitative approaches. However, no specific datasets are mentioned yet, so I will continue to the methods section.

In **section 2 (Methods)**, the author describes the data acquisition process. Here, it is stated that data was acquired from the **OASIS 3 database** in the form of T1 weighted MRI scans. This is a clear indication of a dataset being used.

Next, I will look for details about the dataset in **subsection 2.1 (Data Acquisition and Pre-processing)**. The author specifies that the OASIS 3 database was chosen due to the abundance of high-quality T1 weighted MRI scans, and mentions that a total of 121 scans were selected, divided into two groups: Alzheimer’s Group (AD) and Normal Controls (NC). This provides important context about the dataset's composition.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the OASIS 3 database. The relevant reference is:

- For **OASIS 3 database**, the citation is:
  > P. J. LaMontagne, T. L. Benzinger, J. C. Morris, S. Keefe, R. Hornbeck, C. Xiong, E. Grant, J. Hassenstab, K. Moulder, A. Vlassenko et al., “Oasis-3: longitudinal neuroimaging, clinical, and cognitive dataset for normal aging and alzheimer disease,” medRxiv, 2019.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the findings:

1. **OASIS 3 Database**: This dataset consists of T1 weighted MRI scans used for diagnosing Alzheimer's Disease, with a total of 121 scans divided into two groups (60 AD and 61 NC).

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing, ensuring that the full citation is included for the dataset.
