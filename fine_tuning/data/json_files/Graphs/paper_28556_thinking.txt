To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Generalizable Cross-Graph Embedding for GNN-based Congestion Prediction" by Amur Ghose et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and it may mention specific datasets used for experiments or evaluations.

Next, I will focus on **section IV (Dataset Generation for Congestion Prediction)**, as this section is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets used in the study. Here, the authors mention two datasets:

1. **Superblue Dataset**: This dataset is derived from the DAC 2012 benchmarks and includes various circuit names with specific details such as the number of nodes, terminals, and nets. The authors provide a table (Table I) that outlines the specifics of the Superblue dataset, including the training, validation, and test sets.

2. **OPENROAD Dataset**: This dataset consists of a collection of circuits provided with the OPENROAD framework. Similar to the Superblue dataset, the authors present a table (Table II) that details the circuit names, nodes, terminals, and nets for the OPENROAD dataset.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For the **Superblue Dataset**, the citation is:
> N. Viswanathan, C. Alpert, C. Sze, Z. Li, and Y. Wei. *The DAC 2012 Routability-Driven Placement Contest and Benchmark Suite*. In DAC Design Automation Conference 2012, pp. 774â€“782.

For the **OPENROAD Dataset**, the citation is:
> T. Ajayi and D. Blaauw. *OpenROAD: Toward a Self-Driving, Open-Source Digital Layout Implementation Tool Chain*. In Proceedings of Government Microcircuit Applications and Critical Technology Conference, 2019.

Now that I have the dataset names and their corresponding citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This will ensure that all relevant details are captured accurately and can be referenced appropriately in future work.
