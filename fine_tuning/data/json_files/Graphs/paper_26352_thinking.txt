To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Better Understanding Hierarchical Visual Relationship for Image Caption" by Zheng-cong Fei et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. In the abstract, the authors mention conducting experiments on the **COCO image captioning dataset**, which indicates that this dataset is likely to be detailed further in the paper.

Next, I will check the **experiments section** where the authors provide a more comprehensive description of the datasets used. They specifically mention:

1. **COCO Dataset**: This dataset is a standard benchmark for image captioning tasks, containing 123,287 images, with each image annotated with five descriptions. The authors note that they utilize the Karpathy split for training and validation.

2. **Visual Genome**: This dataset is used to pre-train the object detector (Faster R-CNN) and contains images with annotated objects, attributes, and relationships. The authors specify that they use 98,077 images for training.

3. **MIT67 Dataset**: This dataset includes 67 classes of indoor scenes, which the authors use to train their hierarchical GCN model. They mention that it covers a wide range of contexts.

After identifying these datasets, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations I will extract are:

- For **COCO Dataset**:
  > Tsung Yi Lin, Michael Maire, Serge Belongie, James Hays, Pietro Perona, Deva Ramanan, Piotr DollÃ¡r, and C. Lawrence Zitnick. *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. In European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), 2014.

- For **Visual Genome**:
  > Ranjay Krishna, Yuke Zhu, Oliver Groth, Justin Johnson, Kenji Hata, Joshua Kravitz, Stephanie Chen, Yannis Kalandidis, Li Jia Li, and David A. Shamma. *Visual Genome: Connecting Language and Vision Using Crowdsourced Dense Image Annotations*. In IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 2017.

- For **MIT67 Dataset**:
  > A. Quattoni and A. Torralba. *Recognizing Indoor Scenes*. In 2009 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2009.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or processing.
