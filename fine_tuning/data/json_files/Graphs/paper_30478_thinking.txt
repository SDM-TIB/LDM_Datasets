To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Digital Asset Valuation: A Study on Domain Names, Email Addresses, and NFTs" by Kai Sun, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant details, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract introduces **DASH**, the first Digital Asset Sales History dataset, which includes transactions for domain names, email addresses, and NFTs. This indicates that there are multiple datasets to extract.

Next, I will look for specific sections that detail the datasets. In this case, the **Data** section (Section 3) provides a comprehensive overview of the datasets. The paper describes three subsets of DASH:

1. **DASHDN**: This subset contains transactions of domain names, with statistics provided such as the number of transactions, sales price range, and date range.
2. **DASHEA**: This subset includes email address transactions, with similar statistics as DASHDN.
3. **DASHNFT**: This subset focuses on NFT-based identifiers, detailing its unique characteristics and statistics.

I will extract the relevant statistics for each dataset, including the number of transactions, sales price ranges, and any unique features that distinguish them.

After identifying the datasets and their characteristics, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The paper does not provide separate citations for DASHDN, DASHEA, and DASHNFT, as they are part of the DASH dataset created by the author. However, I will note that the dataset and code will be available at the provided URL (https://dataset.org/dash/), which serves as a reference for the dataset.

Now, I will summarize the datasets with their key details:

- **DASHDN**: The largest freely accessible domain name transaction dataset, consisting of 159,047 transactions with a sales price range from 1 USD to 5,000,000 USD.
- **DASHEA**: The only publicly available email address transaction dataset, containing 20,308 transactions with a sales price range from 0.0001 CNY to 11,111 CNY.
- **DASHNFT**: The first NFT transaction dataset focusing on identifiers, with 100,387 transactions and a sales price range from 1 Ã— 10^-18 ETH to 420 ETH.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that highlights each dataset's name, description, and relevant statistics, ensuring that I include the URL for the DASH dataset as a reference. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets extracted from the paper.
