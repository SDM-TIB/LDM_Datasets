To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Typilus: Neural Type Hints" by Miltiadis Allamanis et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that Typilus is evaluated on a dataset of Python projects, which suggests that there is a dataset involved. I will look for specific names or descriptions of datasets in these sections.

Next, I will proceed to the **experiments** section, particularly focusing on any subsections that discuss datasets or data collection methods. In this paper, the authors describe their dataset collection process in **section 6 (Quantitative Evaluation)**. They mention that they collected data from 600 Python repositories on GitHub that contain at least one type annotation. This indicates that the dataset is derived from real-world projects.

In this section, the authors provide details about the dataset, including the number of files, symbols, and types. They mention that the dataset consists of **118,440 files** with a total of **5,997,459 symbols**, of which **252,470** have a non-Any non-None type annotation. This information is crucial for describing the dataset.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. However, in this case, the dataset is derived from publicly available repositories rather than a formally published dataset. Therefore, I will note that the dataset is based on the collection of Python projects from GitHub.

The authors also mention using **pytype** to augment their corpus with type annotations inferred from static analysis, which is relevant to the dataset's construction. However, since pytype is a tool rather than a dataset, I will not include it as a separate dataset.

Finally, I will summarize the dataset information as follows:

1. **Python Projects Dataset**: A collection of 600 Python repositories from GitHub containing at least one type annotation. The dataset consists of 118,440 files and 5,997,459 symbols, with 252,470 having non-Any non-None type annotations.

Since there are no formal citations for this dataset, I will note that it is based on the authors' collection from GitHub.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
