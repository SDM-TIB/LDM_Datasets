To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Self-supervised Training of Graph Convolutional Networks" by Qikui Zhu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and method sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. In the abstract, the authors refer to using **three public citation network datasets**: Citeseer, Cora, and Pubmed. This indicates that these datasets are central to the research.

Next, I will look for a dedicated section that discusses the datasets in detail. In this paper, the **A. Datasets** section provides a summary of the three datasets, including their characteristics such as the number of nodes, edges, features, categories, and the distribution of training, validation, and test nodes. This section is crucial for gathering detailed information about each dataset.

The datasets are summarized as follows:

1. **Citeseer**: 
   - Number of Nodes: 3,327
   - Number of Edges: 4,732
   - Number of Features: 3,327
   - Number of Categories: 6
   - Number of Training Nodes: 120
   - Number of Validation Nodes: 500
   - Number of Test Nodes: 1,000

2. **Cora**: 
   - Number of Nodes: 2,708
   - Number of Edges: 5,429
   - Number of Features: 1,433
   - Number of Categories: 7
   - Number of Training Nodes: 140
   - Number of Validation Nodes: 500
   - Number of Test Nodes: 1,000

3. **Pubmed**: 
   - Number of Nodes: 19,717
   - Number of Edges: 44,338
   - Number of Features: 500
   - Number of Categories: 3
   - Number of Training Nodes: 60
   - Number of Validation Nodes: 500
   - Number of Test Nodes: 1,000

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The paper cites the following references for the datasets:

- For **Citeseer**, the citation is:
  > Z. Yang, W. W. Cohen, and R. Salakhutdinov. *Revisiting semi-supervised learning with graph embeddings*. International Conference on Machine Learning, pp. 40–48, 2016.

- For **Cora**, the citation is:
  > Z. Yang, W. W. Cohen, and R. Salakhutdinov. *Revisiting semi-supervised learning with graph embeddings*. International Conference on Machine Learning, pp. 40–48, 2016.

- For **Pubmed**, the citation is:
  > Z. Yang, W. W. Cohen, and R. Salakhutdinov. *Revisiting semi-supervised learning with graph embeddings*. International Conference on Machine Learning, pp. 40–48, 2016.

Since all three datasets are referenced in the same paper, I will use the same citation for each dataset.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective details and citations into a structured format for further processing. This ensures that I have accurately captured all necessary information regarding the datasets used in the research.
