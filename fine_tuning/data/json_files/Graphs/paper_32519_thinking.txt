To extract datasets from the research paper titled "FoX: Formation-aware exploration in multi-agent reinforcement learning" by Yonghyeon Jo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly referenced. The abstract mentions that the proposed FoX framework is evaluated on **Google Research Football (GRF)** and **sparse Starcraft II multi-agent challenge (SMAC)** tasks, indicating that these environments are likely datasets or benchmarks used in the research.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of these datasets in the **experiments section**. In this section, the authors describe their experimental setup and the environments used for evaluation. They confirm that the **Google Research Football (GRF)** and **StarCraft II Multi-Agent Challenge (SMAC)** are the environments where they tested their framework.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. **Google Research Football (GRF)**: The citation is:
   > Kurach, K., Raichuk, A., Stańczyk, P., Zając, M., Bachem, O., Espeholt, L., Riquelme, C., Vincent, D., Michalski, M., Bousquet, O., et al. (2020). *Google research football: A novel reinforcement learning environment*. In Proceedings of the AAAI conference on artificial intelligence, volume 34, pages 4501–4510.

2. **StarCraft II Multi-Agent Challenge (SMAC)**: The citation is:
   > Samvelyan, M., Rashid, T., De Witt, C. S., Farquhar, G., Nardelli, N., Rudner, T. G., Hung, C.-M., Torr, P. H., Foerster, J., and Whiteson, S. (2019). *The starcraft multi-agent challenge*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1902.04043.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described with its full citation, as this is crucial for proper documentation and referencing in future work.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for output, ensuring they are structured and ready for any required downstream processing or review.
