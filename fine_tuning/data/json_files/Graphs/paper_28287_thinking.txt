To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Semi-supervised Contrastive Learning for Label-efficient Medical Image Segmentation" by Xinrong Hu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant details, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their methods on two public biomedical image datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experiments and Results)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention two datasets:

1. **Hippocampus Dataset**: This dataset is sourced from the MICCAI 2018 medical segmentation decathlon challenge and consists of 260 3D volumes of mono-modal MRI scans with annotations for the anterior and posterior hippocampus body.

2. **MMWHS Dataset**: This dataset comes from the MICCAI 2017 challenge and includes 20 3D cardiac CT volumes with annotations for seven structures of the heart: left ventricle, left atrium, right ventricle, right atrium, myocardium, ascending aorta, and pulmonary artery.

To ensure accuracy, I will also check the **References section** for full citations of these datasets:

- For the **Hippocampus Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Medical segmentation decathlon challenge. http://medicaldecathlon.com/index.html (2018).

- For the **MMWHS Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Zhuang, X., & Shen, J. (2016). Multi-scale patch and multi-modality atlases for whole heart segmentation of MRI. *Medical Image Analysis*, 31, 77â€“87.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly presents each dataset along with its citation.

This systematic approach ensures that I accurately capture the datasets used in the research and provide the necessary citations for further reference.
