To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Hashing-Accelerated Graph Neural Networks for Link Prediction" by Wei Wu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction typically outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of link prediction in network analysis and mention various datasets used in their experiments. I will look for specific names of datasets and any relevant details about them.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experimental Results)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they summarize five datasets, including:

1. **Twitter Dataset**: This dataset consists of 2,511 Twitter users as nodes and 37,154 following relationships as edges. The hashtags specified by users act as attribute information, with a total of 9,073 attributes.

2. **Facebook Dataset**: An ego-network collected from survey participants using the Facebook app, containing 4,039 nodes and 88,234 links. Each node is described by a 1,403-dimensional feature vector.

3. **BlogCatalog Dataset**: This dataset consists of 5,196 users as nodes and 171,743 following relationships as edges. The tags of interest specified by users serve as attribute information, totaling 8,189 attributes.

4. **Flickr Dataset**: Comprising 7,564 bloggers as nodes and 239,365 following relationships as edges, with keywords in the bloggers' blog descriptions as attributes, totaling 12,047 attributes.

5. **Google+ Dataset**: An ego-network of Google+ users with 7,856 nodes and 321,268 edges, where each node is modeled as a 2,024-dimensional feature vector from user profiles.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations may not always be directly provided in the paper, so I will look for the original sources or related works cited by the authors.

For example, the Twitter dataset may reference a specific study or dataset repository, while the Facebook dataset might be linked to a survey or research project. I will ensure to document the full citation format as required.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, including their names, descriptions, and citations, into a structured format for further processing or review.
