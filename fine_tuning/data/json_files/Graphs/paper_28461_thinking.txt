To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Inconsistent Few-Shot Relation Classification via Cross-Attentional Prototype Networks with Contrastive Learning" by Hongru Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the challenges of few-shot relation classification and hints at the use of datasets for evaluation, which is a good starting point.

In the **introduction**, the authors reference existing works and datasets related to few-shot relation classification. Specifically, they mention the **FewRel dataset**, which is a well-known dataset in this area. I will look for more details about this dataset in the subsequent sections.

Next, I will check the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they confirm that they use the **FewRel dataset** for their evaluations. They provide details about the dataset, including the number of relations and sentences, which is crucial for understanding its scope.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citation for the FewRel dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:
> Han, X.; Zhu, H.; Yu, P.; Wang, Z.; Yao, Y.; Liu, Z.; and Sun, M. 2018. FewRel: A large-scale supervised few-shot relation classification dataset with state-of-the-art evaluation. In Proceedings of the 2018 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, 4803â€“4809. Brussels, Belgium: Association for Computational Linguistics.

Having identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the findings:

1. **FewRel Dataset**: This dataset consists of 100 relations and 700 sentences per relation, specifically designed for few-shot relation classification tasks. The training, validation, and test sets contain 64, 20, and 16 relations, respectively.

With this information, I will prepare the dataset entry for the FewRel dataset, ensuring that I include the full citation as it is critical for proper attribution in any subsequent use or analysis.
