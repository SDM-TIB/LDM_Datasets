To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Bag of Instances Aggregation Boosts Self-Supervised Distillation" by Haohang Xu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the performance of the proposed method, BINGO, on various tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this paper, the authors mention using the **ImageNet dataset** for their experiments. They provide details about the model architectures and the performance metrics, which indicates that ImageNet is a key dataset for their evaluations.

I will also check the **related work section** and **conclusion** to see if any other datasets are referenced or if there are mentions of datasets used in previous works that might be relevant.

In the **experiments section**, the authors specifically mention the following datasets:

1. **ImageNet**: This dataset is widely used for image classification tasks and is referenced multiple times throughout the paper. The authors report their results on ImageNet under various protocols, including linear evaluation and semi-supervised learning.

2. **COCO (Common Objects in Context)**: The authors also evaluate their method on the COCO dataset for object detection and instance segmentation tasks. They provide performance metrics for models fine-tuned on COCO, indicating its importance in their experiments.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, and Li Fei-Fei. *Imagenet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In 2009 IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pp. 248–255. IEEE, 2009.

- For **COCO**, the citation is:
  > Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, Serge Belongie, James Hays, Pietro Perona, Deva Ramanan, Piotr Dollár, and C Lawrence Zitnick. *Microsoft COCO: Common objects in context*. In European conference on computer vision, pp. 740–755. Springer, 2014.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
