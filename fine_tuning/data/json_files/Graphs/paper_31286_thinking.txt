To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Diversity matters: Robustness of bias measurements in Wikidata" by Paramita Das et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, which includes the analysis of biases in knowledge graphs, specifically Wikidata. It mentions the collection of data from various demographics, which indicates that datasets are involved.

Next, I will look into **section 4 (Dataset Description)**, as this section is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets used in the study. Here, the authors describe their methodology for collecting data from Wikidata, including the demographics they focused on. They mention that they extracted triples from Wikidata based on specific criteria, leading to the creation of a dataset that includes various demographics.

In **subsection 4.1 (Collection of demography dataset)**, the authors provide a table (Table 1) summarizing the statistics of entities, triples, humans, and occupations for each of the 13 demographics they considered. This table is crucial as it outlines the specific datasets they utilized for their experiments.

The demographics listed include:
- Arabia
- India
- Japan
- Russia
- Australia
- Kenya
- South Africa
- France
- Germany
- UK
- Argentina
- Brazil
- USA

For each demographic, the paper provides the number of triplets, entities, human entities, and occupations, which gives a clear picture of the dataset's structure.

Now, I will gather the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper does not provide specific citations for the datasets since they are derived from Wikidata, but I can reference the original source of the data:

1. **Wikidata**: The dataset is based on the latest Wikidata dump, which can be cited as follows:
   > Wikimedia Foundation. *Wikidata: A free and open knowledge base*. Retrieved from https://www.wikidata.org/

2. **Demographic Dataset**: The specific demographic datasets are derived from the Wikidata entries for the 13 demographics mentioned above. Since these datasets are not standalone publications, they do not have separate citations but are part of the larger Wikidata project.

After identifying the datasets and their sources, I will compile this information into a structured format that highlights each dataset's name, description, and citation.

In summary, I will extract the following datasets:
- **Wikidata Demographic Dataset**: A collection of triples from Wikidata representing various demographics, including statistics on entities, triplets, and occupations.

Finally, I will ensure that all extracted information is accurately documented and ready for further processing or review.
