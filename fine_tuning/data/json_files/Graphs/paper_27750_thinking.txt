To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Optimal Wireless Resource Allocation with Random Edge Graph Neural Networks" by Mark Eisen and Alejandro Ribeiro, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and it may mention specific datasets used for simulations or experiments.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. This is often where authors describe the datasets they used for their evaluations. If the paper includes a section titled "Experiments" or "Results," I will pay close attention to it, as it typically contains details about the datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

In this paper, I will specifically look for any numerical simulations or experiments that involve data collection or analysis. The authors may describe the datasets used for training their models or for validating their results.

Once I identify the datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. This is crucial as it allows me to provide accurate and complete references for each dataset. I will ensure that I capture the authors, title, publication venue, and year for each dataset mentioned in the paper.

For example, if the authors mention using a dataset like the "Penn Action Dataset," I will look for its citation in the references. If they refer to a dataset that is not widely known, I will ensure to capture its citation accurately.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, into a structured format that can be easily reviewed or processed further.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I extract all relevant datasets from the paper along with their proper citations.
