To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Re-Attention Transformer for Weakly Supervised Object Localization" by Hui Su et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors conducted extensive experiments on two benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved. I will note this down for further investigation.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (specifically section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In section 4.1, the authors mention that they evaluated their proposed method on two commonly used benchmark datasets: **ILSVRC** and **CUB-200-2011**. This is a clear indication that these datasets are crucial for their research.

Now, I will gather more details about these datasets. I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for both datasets:

1. **ILSVRC (ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge)**: The citation is:
   > Olga Russakovsky, Jia Deng, Hao Su, Jonathan Krause, Sanjeev Satheesh, Sean Ma, Zhiheng Huang, Andrej Karpathy, Aditya Khosla, Michael Bernstein, et al. *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 115(3):211â€“252, 2015.

2. **CUB-200-2011 (Caltech-UCSD Birds-200-2011)**: The citation is:
   > Catherine Wah, Steve Branson, Peter Welinder, Pietro Perona, and Serge Belongie. *The Caltech-UCSD Birds-200-2011 Dataset*. 2011.

After confirming the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use. This process ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets utilized in the research and their corresponding citations, which is essential for proper attribution and reference in any subsequent work.
