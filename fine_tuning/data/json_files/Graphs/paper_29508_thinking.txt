To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Meta-Learning Based Knowledge Extrapolation for Knowledge Graphs in the Federated Setting" by Mingyang Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors introduce datasets for knowledge extrapolation in the federated setting, which indicates that datasets are indeed present in the paper. I will look for specific names or descriptions of these datasets.

Next, I will proceed to the **methodology** section, particularly focusing on **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, I will look for any explicit mentions of dataset names, their characteristics, and how they were generated or sampled.

In the **experiments section**, the authors specifically mention two datasets derived from standard knowledge graph benchmarks: **FB-Ext** and **NELL-Ext**. I will note the details provided about these datasets, including their purpose and the context in which they were used.

The paper provides statistics for both datasets, including the number of entities, relations, and triples, which I will also document. The authors explain that these datasets were created by sampling from the original benchmarks (FB15k-237 and NELL-995) and that they contain unseen entities and relations in the test set.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the original datasets from which FB-Ext and NELL-Ext were derived. The citations I need to include are:

- For **FB15k-237**:
  > Toutanova, K., Chen, D., Pantel, P., Poon, H., Choudhury, P., & Gamon, M. (2015). Representing text for joint embedding of text and knowledge bases. In *Proceedings of the 2015 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP)*, pages 1590-1599.

- For **NELL-995**:
  > Xiong, W., Hoang, T., & Wang, W. Y. (2017). Deeppath: A reinforcement learning method for knowledge graph reasoning. In *Proceedings of the 2017 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP)*, pages 564-574.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
