To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Progressive Evidence Refinement for Open-Domain Multimodal Retrieval Question Answering" by Shuwen Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors validate their model on two benchmark datasets: **WebQA** and **MultimodalQA**. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for understanding the experiments conducted.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used. In section 4.1, they explicitly mention the two datasets:

1. **WebQA**: This dataset contains multi-hop, multimodal question-answer pairs, requiring 1-2 images or text snippets to answer. The paper states that the answers are in free-form sentences and that evaluation metrics include F1 and QA-FL.

2. **MultimodalQA**: This dataset comprises multimodal questions from various modalities, including images, text, and tables. The questions are generated from templates, and the evaluation metrics used are Exact Match (EM) and Average F1.

To ensure I have the correct citations, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **WebQA**, the citation is:
  > Yingshan Chang, Mridu Narang, Hisami Suzuki, Guihong Cao, Jianfeng Gao, and Yonatan Bisk. *WebQA: Multihop and multimodal QA*. In Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 16495â€“16504, 2022.

- For **MultimodalQA**, the citation is:
  > Alon Talmor, Ori Yoran, Amnon Catav, Dan Lahav, Yizhong Wang, Akari Asai, Gabriel Ilharco, Hannaneh Hajishirzi, and Jonathan Berant. *MultimodalQA: Complex Question Answering Over Text, Tables and Images*. In International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR), 2020.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
