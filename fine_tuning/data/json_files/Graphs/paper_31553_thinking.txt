To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MoLo: Motion-augmented Long-short Contrastive Learning for Few-shot Action Recognition" by Xiang Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method on five standard benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any relevant sections that discuss the datasets used for experiments. In this paper, the **experiments section** (specifically section 4.1) provides a clear overview of the datasets utilized. The authors mention five commonly used few-shot datasets:

1. **SSv2-Full**: A comprehensive dataset for action recognition, which includes a wide variety of action classes.
2. **SSv2-Small**: A smaller subset of the SSv2 dataset, containing 100 samples per category.
3. **Kinetics**: A well-known dataset for action recognition that includes a large number of action classes.
4. **UCF101**: A dataset containing 101 action classes, widely used in action recognition research.
5. **HMDB51**: A dataset that includes 51 action classes, commonly used for benchmarking action recognition methods.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for the datasets used in the research.

The full citations for the datasets mentioned in the paper are as follows:

- **SSv2-Full**: 
  > A. Goyal et al. "The ‘Something’ Video Database for Learning and Evaluating Visual Common Sense." In ICCV, 2017.

- **SSv2-Small**: 
  > A. Goyal et al. "The ‘Something’ Video Database for Learning and Evaluating Visual Common Sense." In ICCV, 2017.

- **Kinetics**: 
  > Joao Carreira and Andrew Zisserman. "Quo vadis, action recognition? A new model and the kinetics dataset." In CVPR, 2017.

- **UCF101**: 
  > Khurram Soomro, Amir Roshan Zamir, and Mubarak Shah. "UCF101: A Dataset of 101 Human Actions Classes From Videos in The Wild." arXiv, 2012.

- **HMDB51**: 
  > H. Kuehne et al. "HMDB: A large video database for human motion recognition." In ICCV, 2011.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
