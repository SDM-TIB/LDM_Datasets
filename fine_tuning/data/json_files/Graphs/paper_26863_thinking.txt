To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Traffic Light Dynamic Control Algorithm with Deep Reinforcement Learning Based on GNN Prediction" by Xiaorong Hu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiment sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on "two real-world datasets of Hangzhou and New-York," indicating that these datasets are crucial for understanding the research.

Next, I will look for specific details about these datasets in the **experiments section**. The authors describe three datasets used in their experiments: 

1. **Single Dataset**: This dataset involves a single intersection with manually generated traffic flow. The authors provide specific details about the traffic flow intervals, which is important for understanding the dataset's structure.

2. **New-York Dataset**: This dataset is based on collected vehicle trajectories from real-world data, specifically mentioning that it includes 48 intersections with defined lane lengths.

3. **Hangzhou Dataset**: Similar to the New-York dataset, this one is based on real-world data and includes 16 intersections with specified distances between them.

I will also check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. However, since the datasets are based on real-world data from specific cities, they may not have formal citations like traditional datasets. Instead, I will note the context in which they are used.

The citations for the datasets based on the context provided in the paper are as follows:

- For the **Single Dataset**, there is no formal citation as it is manually generated.
  
- For the **New-York Dataset**, the context suggests it is based on vehicle trajectories collected from the city, but no specific citation is provided in the paper.

- For the **Hangzhou Dataset**, similar to the New-York dataset, it is based on real-world data but lacks a formal citation.

Now, I will compile the information about each dataset, including their names, descriptions, and any relevant details, ensuring that I maintain clarity and accuracy in the descriptions. 

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring that I include all necessary details for each dataset as described in the paper.
