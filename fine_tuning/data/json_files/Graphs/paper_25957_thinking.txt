To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Regularized Attention Mechanism for Graph Attention Networks" by Uday Shankar Shanthamallu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of benchmark datasets for demonstrating performance improvements, which indicates that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experiment Setup and Results)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. They refer to two benchmark citation datasets: **Cora** and **Citeseer**. I will look for detailed descriptions of these datasets, including their characteristics and how they are utilized in the experiments.

In this section, the authors describe the Cora and Citeseer datasets as follows:
- **Cora Dataset**: A citation network where documents are treated as nodes, and citations among the documents are encoded as undirected edges. Each node is endowed with an attribute vector (bag-of-words representation).
- **Citeseer Dataset**: Similar to Cora, it is also a citation network with the same structure and representation.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The authors reference the datasets as follows:
- For **Cora Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Prithviraj Sen, Galileo Namata, Mustafa Bilgic, Lise Getoor, Brian Galligher, and Tina Eliassi-Rad. *Collective classification in network data*. AI magazine, vol. 29, no. 3, pp. 93, 2008.

- For **Citeseer Dataset**, the same citation applies as it is part of the same study.

Since both datasets are mentioned in the same reference, I will ensure to note that they are part of the same citation.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for both datasets in the final output. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
