To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Approximate Message Passing-Enhanced Graph Neural Network for OTFS Data Detection" by Wenhao Zhuang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections for any references to datasets. The abstract discusses the development of a new detector for OTFS modulation but does not explicitly mention any datasets. The introduction may provide more context or references to datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **experiments** within the paper. This is typically where authors describe the datasets they used for their experiments. If such a section exists, I will carefully read through it to identify the datasets, their characteristics, and how they were utilized in the research.

If the paper does not have a clear section on datasets, I will check the **methodology** or **experiments** sections, as authors often describe the datasets in the context of their experimental setup. I will look for any mentions of specific datasets, including their names, sizes, and any relevant details about their structure or content.

Once I identify the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to ensure that the datasets can be accessed or referenced by others.

For example, if I find that the authors used a dataset called "OTFS Data Detection Dataset," I will look for its citation in the references. If the dataset is not directly cited but is derived from another source, I will ensure to cite the original source accurately.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is clearly documented for future reference.

In summary, my steps will be:
1. Read the abstract and introduction for any mentions of datasets.
2. Look for a dedicated section on datasets or experiments.
3. Identify datasets and their characteristics.
4. Check the references for full citations of each dataset.
5. Compile the information in a clear and organized manner.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets used in the research paper.
