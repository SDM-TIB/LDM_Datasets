To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Edge-Enhanced Global Disentangled Graph Neural Network for Sequential Recommendation" by Yunyi Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors evaluate their method on **three real-world datasets**, which indicates that specific datasets will be discussed later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In the introduction, the authors mention that they evaluate their model on three datasets, but I need to find the exact names and details of these datasets.

Upon reviewing the **experiments section**, I find that the authors specifically mention the following datasets:

1. **MovieLens-1M**: A dataset containing 1 million user ratings for movies, which is commonly used for evaluating recommendation systems.

2. **Beauty**: An Amazon e-commerce dataset that includes user purchasing behaviors in the beauty category, specifically the 5-core version.

3. **Games**: Another Amazon dataset that captures user interactions with video games, also using the 5-core version.

Now, I will check the **References section** to gather full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **MovieLens-1M**, the citation is:
  > F. Maxwell Harper and Joseph A. Konstan. *The MovieLens Datasets: History and Context*. ACM Transactions on Interactive Intelligent Systems, 5(4):19, 2015.

- For **Beauty** and **Games**, the datasets are part of the Amazon product dataset, which is often cited as:
  > J. McAuley and J. Leskovec. *From Amateurs to Connoisseurs: Modeling the Growth of User Expertise through Online Reviews*. In Proceedings of the 22nd International Conference on World Wide Web (WWW), pages 897â€“908, 2013.

With this information, I can now summarize the datasets extracted from the paper, ensuring to include their full citations.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
