To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DGC: Training Dynamic Graphs with Spatio-Temporal Non-Uniformity using Graph Partitioning by Chunks" by Fahao Chen, Peng Li, and Celimuge Wu, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors present experimental results on **four popular dynamic graph datasets**, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, I find that **Table 1** lists the datasets used for evaluation, which includes:

1. **Amazon Dataset**: This dataset consists of 500 snapshots, 72 million vertices, and 13 million edges.
2. **Epinion Dataset**: This dataset has 121 snapshots, 103 million vertices, and 5.7 million edges.
3. **Movie Dataset**: This dataset contains 289 snapshots, 43 million vertices, and 27 million edges.
4. **Stack Dataset**: This dataset includes 93 snapshots, 83 million vertices, and 47 million edges.

I will confirm that these datasets are indeed used in the experiments by checking the **experiments section** where the authors discuss their findings based on these datasets.

Now, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. However, the paper does not provide specific citations for the datasets themselves, as they are likely well-known datasets in the field of dynamic graphs. Therefore, I will note that the datasets are commonly referenced in the literature.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format, ensuring to include the dataset names, descriptions, and any relevant metrics as outlined in the paper.

In summary, the datasets extracted from the paper are:

1. **Amazon Dataset**: 500 snapshots, 72 million vertices, 13 million edges.
2. **Epinion Dataset**: 121 snapshots, 103 million vertices, 5.7 million edges.
3. **Movie Dataset**: 289 snapshots, 43 million vertices, 27 million edges.
4. **Stack Dataset**: 93 snapshots, 83 million vertices, 47 million edges.

Since the paper does not provide specific citations for these datasets, I will note that they are widely recognized in the field of dynamic graph research.
