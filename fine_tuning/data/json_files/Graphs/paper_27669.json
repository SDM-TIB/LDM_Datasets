        "dcterms:description": "NTU60 is a widely-used benchmark dataset for skeleton-based action recognition, incorporating 56,000 videos. The action videos were collected in a laboratory environment, resulting in accurately extracted skeletons. Nonetheless, recognizing actions from these skeletons is still challenging due to five aspects: (1) the skeletons are captured from different viewpoints; (2) the skeleton sizes of subjects vary; (3) so do their speeds of action; (4) different actions can have similar motion trajectories; (5) there are limited joints to portray hand actions in detail.",
