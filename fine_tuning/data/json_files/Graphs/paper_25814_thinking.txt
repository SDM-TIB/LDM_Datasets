To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Deep Versus Wide Convolutional Neural Networks for Object Recognition on Neuromorphic System" by Md Zahangir Alom et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract states that the authors performed experiments using benchmark datasets such as **MNIST, COIL-20, and COIL-100**, which indicates that these datasets are relevant to the study.

Next, I will look into the **Database section** (Section V) where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention:

1. **MNIST**: This dataset consists of 60,000 training samples and 10,000 test samples of 28x28 grayscale images representing digits from 0 to 9.

2. **COIL-20**: This dataset contains images of 20 objects, with 72 poses each, totaling 1,440 observations. The authors specify that 1,100 samples are used for training and 300 for testing.

3. **COIL-100**: An extension of COIL-20, this dataset includes 7,000 color images across 100 classes of objects, with 5,000 samples for training and 2,000 for testing.

Now, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **MNIST**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun, et al. "Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition." *Proceedings of the IEEE*, 86.11 (1998): 2278-2324.

- For **COIL-20**, the citation is:
  > S. A. Nene, S. K. Nayar, and H. Murase. "Columbia Object Image Library (COIL-20)." Technical Report CUCS-005-96, February 1996.

- For **COIL-100**, the citation is:
  > S. A. Nene, S. K. Nayar, and H. Murase. "Columbia Object Image Library (COIL-100)." Technical Report CUCS-006-96, February 1996.

With this information, I can now summarize the datasets and their citations clearly.

1. **MNIST**: A benchmark image classification dataset consisting of 60,000 training samples and 10,000 test samples of handwritten digits.
   - Citation: Yann LeCun, et al. "Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition." *Proceedings of the IEEE*, 86.11 (1998): 2278-2324.

2. **COIL-20**: A dataset containing images of 20 objects, with 72 poses each, totaling 1,440 observations.
   - Citation: S. A. Nene, S. K. Nayar, and H. Murase. "Columbia Object Image Library (COIL-20)." Technical Report CUCS-005-96, February 1996.

3. **COIL-100**: An extended dataset of COIL-20, containing 7,000 color images for 100 classes of objects.
   - Citation: S. A. Nene, S. K. Nayar, and H. Murase. "Columbia Object Image Library (COIL-100)." Technical Report CUCS-006-96, February 1996.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
