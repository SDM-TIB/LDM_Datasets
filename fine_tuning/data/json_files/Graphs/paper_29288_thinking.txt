To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Semantic Pose Verification for Outdoor Visual Localization with Self-supervised Contrastive Learning" by Semih Orhan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the use of a dataset of semantically segmented images, which indicates that there is at least one dataset involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Methodology and Dataset)**, where the authors describe their dataset preparation. Here, they specify that their dataset consists of images captured in Pittsburgh, PA, and that panoramic images were obtained from Google Street View. They also mention that query images were taken from the UCF dataset, which provides specific names for the datasets used.

In this section, the authors detail the composition of their dataset:
1. **Google Street View**: This dataset provides panoramic images used as the database for visual localization. The authors note that these images were downloaded using the Street View Download 360 application.
2. **UCF Dataset**: This dataset is used for collecting query images corresponding to the panoramic images. The authors specify that these query images were collected from Google Street View before 2014.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Google Street View**, while the paper does not provide a formal citation, it is widely recognized as a resource for panoramic images. A common reference for Google Street View is:
  > Google. *Google Street View*. Available at: https://www.google.com/streetview/

- For the **UCF dataset**, the citation is:
  > Amir Roshan Zamir and Mubarak Shah. *Image geo-localization based on multiple nearest neighbor feature matching using generalized graphs*. IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 36(8):1546â€“1558, 2014.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets in a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research.
