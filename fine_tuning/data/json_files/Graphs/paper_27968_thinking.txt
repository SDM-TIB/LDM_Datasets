To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Blind Image Super-Resolution via Contrastive Representation Learning" by Jiahui Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that extensive experiments were conducted on synthetic datasets and real images, which indicates that there are datasets involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets and Training Settings)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for training and evaluation. Here, they mention two training datasets and four evaluation datasets:

1. **DIV2K**: This dataset is used for training the model. It is a high-quality dataset specifically designed for image super-resolution tasks.
   
2. **Flickr2K**: Another dataset used for training, which contains images sourced from Flickr, also aimed at super-resolution tasks.

For evaluation, the authors mention four standard datasets:

1. **Set5**: A commonly used benchmark dataset for evaluating super-resolution algorithms.
   
2. **Set14**: Another benchmark dataset that is widely used in the super-resolution community.
   
3. **B100**: A dataset that consists of 100 images, often used for testing super-resolution methods.
   
4. **Urban100**: A dataset that contains urban scenes, specifically designed for evaluating super-resolution methods in urban environments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **DIV2K**, the citation is:
  > Eirikur Agustsson and Radu Timofte. *Ntire 2017 challenge on single image super-resolution: Dataset and study*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops, pages 126–135, 2017.

- For **Flickr2K**, the citation is:

- For **Set5**, the citation is:
  > Roman Zeyde, Michael Elad, and Matan Protter. *On single image scale-up using sparse-representations*. In International conference on curves and surfaces, pages 711–730. Springer, 2010.

- For **Set14**, the citation is:
  > Roman Zeyde, Michael Elad, and Matan Protter. *On single image scale-up using sparse-representations*. In International conference on curves and surfaces, pages 711–730. Springer, 2010.

- For **B100**, the citation is:
  > David Martin, Charless Fowlkes, Doron Tal, and Jitendra Malik. *A database of human segmented natural images and its application to evaluating segmentation algorithms and measuring ecological statistics*. In Proceedings Eighth IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision. ICCV 2001, volume 2, pages 416–423. IEEE, 2001.

- For **Urban100**, the citation is:
  > Yulun Zhang, Kunpeng Li, Kai Li, Lichen Wang, Bineng Zhong, and Yun Fu. *Image super-resolution using very deep residual channel attention networks*. In Proceedings of the European conference on computer vision (ECCV), pages 286–301, 2018.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented and properly cited for future reference or processing.
