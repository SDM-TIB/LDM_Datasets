To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Graph Neural Networks for Low-Energy Event Classification & Reconstruction in IceCube," I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and the introduction typically outlines the context and significance of the research. In this case, the introduction mentions the use of simulated low-energy data for studies of atmospheric neutrino oscillations, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Performance on Low-Energy Neutrino Events)**, particularly **subsection 3.1 (Selected Datasets)**. This section is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets used for training and testing the proposed model. Here, the authors describe the IceCube simulation used for training and testing the dynedge classifications and reconstructions, indicating that the dataset consists of approximately 8.3 million simulated neutrino and muon events.

The authors also mention that the dataset selection process is similar to those described in previous works, specifically referencing [10] and [5]. They provide a breakdown of the datasets used for different tasks, including the number of events for training and testing in each category. This detailed information is crucial for accurately documenting the datasets.

I will then look for the **References section** to gather full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper references previous works that describe the dataset and selection process, which will help in providing authoritative citations.

The relevant citations for the datasets are as follows:

1. For the IceCube simulation dataset:
   > M. Aartsen et al., "Measurement of atmospheric neutrino oscillations at 6–56 GeV with IceCube DeepCore," Physical Review Letters 120 (2018).

2. For the GENIE simulation:
   > C. Andreopoulos et al., "The GENIE neutrino Monte Carlo generator," NIM-A 614 (2010) 87–104.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described clearly and that full citations are included for each dataset referenced in the paper. This will ensure that the extracted information is comprehensive and properly attributed.
