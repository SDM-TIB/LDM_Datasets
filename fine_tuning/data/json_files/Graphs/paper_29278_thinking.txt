To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-Robot Active Mapping via Neural Bipartite Graph Matching" by Kai Ye et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used. In this case, the authors mention that their algorithm is trained on the **Gibson dataset** and evaluated on both the **Gibson** and **Matterport3D datasets**. This indicates that these datasets are crucial to their research.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any relevant sections that discuss the datasets in detail. In this paper, the authors describe their experimental setup in **section 5 (Experiments)**. Here, they specify that their algorithm is trained on the **Gibson dataset** and evaluated on the **Matterport3D dataset**. They also mention that the algorithm runs in the **iGibson simulator**, which is relevant for understanding the context of the datasets.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. I will check the **References section** to find the complete citations for the datasets:

1. **Gibson Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Fei Xia, Amir R Zamir, Zhiyang He, Alexander Sax, Jitendra Malik, and Silvio Savarese. *Gibson env: Real-world perception for embodied agents*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 9068â€“9079, 2018.

2. **Matterport3D Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Angel Chang, Angela Dai, Thomas Funkhouser, Maciej Halber, Matthias Niessner, Manolis Savva, Shuran Song, Andy Zeng, and Yinda Zhang. *Matterport3D: Learning from RGB-D data in indoor environments*. International Conference on 3D Vision (3DV), 2017.

After collecting the necessary information, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

- **Gibson Dataset**: Used for training the algorithm, providing a variety of indoor scenes for the multi-robot active mapping task.
- **Matterport3D Dataset**: Used for evaluation, offering a different set of indoor environments to test the generalization of the algorithm.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all information is accurately represented and ready for further processing or review.
