To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MorphoActivation: Generalizing ReLU activation function by mathematical morphology" by Santiago Velasco-Forero and JesÃºs Angulo, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the experimental section validates the proposed approach on classical benchmarks for supervised learning by Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs). This suggests that datasets are likely involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental section** to identify any specific datasets used for validation. In this section, the authors mention using the **MNIST dataset** for a ten-class supervised classification problem. They describe the architecture and the results obtained, which indicates that this dataset is crucial for their experiments.

I will also look for any additional datasets mentioned in the paper. The authors compare their results with those obtained using **CIFAR10**, **CIFAR100**, and **Fashion-MNIST** datasets. These comparisons provide further evidence of the datasets utilized in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

1. **MNIST Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998. Available at: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

2. **CIFAR10 Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009. Available at: https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html

3. **CIFAR100 Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Alex Krizhevsky. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009. Available at: https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html

4. **Fashion-MNIST Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Zalando Research. *Fashion-MNIST: a Novel Image Dataset for Benchmarking Machine Learning Algorithms*. 2017. Available at: https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
