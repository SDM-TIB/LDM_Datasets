To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Embedded Graph Convolutional Networks for Real-Time Event Data Processing on SoC FPGAs" by Kamil Jeziorek et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. In the abstract, the authors mention that they focus on object classification tasks using event data, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section**, specifically looking for any subsection that discusses datasets. In this paper, the authors explicitly mention four datasets used for their experiments:

1. **N-Cars Dataset**: This dataset consists of 24,029 samples across 2 classes, with a duration of 100 ms and a resolution of 120 × 100 pixels.

2. **N-Caltech101 Dataset**: This dataset contains 8,246 samples across 100 classes, with a duration of 300 ms and a resolution of 240 × 180 pixels.

3. **CIFAR10-DVS Dataset**: This dataset has 10,000 samples across 10 classes, with a duration of 1280 ms and a resolution of 128 × 128 pixels.

4. **MNIST-DVS Dataset**: This dataset includes 30,000 samples across 10 classes, with a duration of 2-3 seconds and a resolution of 128 × 128 pixels.

The authors provide a summary of the datasets in **Table II**, which includes details about the number of samples, classes, duration, resolution, and normalization parameters.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, I will compile this into a structured format for further processing or review.
