To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Machine learning approach for biopsy-based identification of eosinophilic esophagitis reveals importance of global features" by Tomer Czyzewski et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study utilized hematoxylin- and eosin-stained slides from esophageal biopsies, which suggests that there is a dataset involved.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, specifically the subsection labeled **Dataset**. Here, the authors describe the collection of esophageal biopsy images from patients with active eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) and control subjects. They mention that a total of 210 images were collected from each group, which provides a clear indication of the dataset's composition.

The authors specify that the images were taken at different resolutions (4140x3096, 2010x1548, and 1360x1024 pixels) and that they created balanced training and validation sets. This detailed description helps in understanding the dataset's structure and purpose.

In the **results section**, the authors discuss the performance of their deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) on the dataset, confirming its significance in the study. They also mention the classification results based on the images derived from the dataset, which further emphasizes its importance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for any datasets or related works mentioned. However, in this case, the dataset is primarily based on the authors' own collection of biopsy images, so I will focus on citing the paper itself.

The citation for the dataset derived from this study is:
> Tomer Czyzewski, Nati Daniel, Mark Rochman, Julie M. Caldwell, Garrett A. Osswald, Margaret H. Collins, Marc E. Rothenberg, and Yonatan Savir. *Machine learning approach for biopsy-based identification of eosinophilic esophagitis reveals importance of global features*. [Journal Name], [Volume], [Page Numbers], [Year]. 

Since the specific journal name, volume, and page numbers are not provided in the text, I will leave placeholders for these details.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format that highlights the dataset's characteristics, including the number of images, resolution, and the context of its use in the study. This will ensure that the dataset is well-documented for future reference or analysis.
