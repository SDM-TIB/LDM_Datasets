To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Building Socio-culturally Inclusive Stereotype Resources with Community Engagement" by Sunipa Dev et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract highlights the creation of a resource that contains stereotypes relevant to the Indian context, which suggests that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (SPICE Dataset: Stereotype Pooling in India with Community Engagement)**, where the authors describe the dataset in detail. Here, they mention that the dataset, named **SPICE**, consists of over 2000 stereotypes collected through community engagement. This section provides crucial information about the dataset's characteristics, including its structure, the demographic diversity of participants, and the types of stereotypes included.

In this section, the authors also discuss the methodology used to collect the data, emphasizing the open-ended survey approach that allowed participants to provide free-form text responses. This indicates that the dataset is rich in qualitative data, which is essential for understanding the socio-cultural context of the stereotypes.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the SPICE dataset. The authors mention that the dataset will be publicly released along with a data card, which is important for proper citation.

The full citation for the SPICE dataset is:
> Sunipa Dev, Jaya Goyal, Dinesh Tewari, Shachi Dave, and Vinodkumar Prabhakaran. *SPICE: Stereotype Pooling in India with Community Engagement*. Dataset to be released publicly through a GitHub link on paper decision.

Now, I will summarize the dataset details:

1. **Dataset Name**: SPICE (Stereotype Pooling in India with Community Engagement)
   - **Description**: A dataset containing over 2000 stereotypes collected through community engagement in India, focusing on various identity axes such as gender, caste, religion, and region.
   - **Methodology**: Collected via open-ended surveys distributed to a diverse participant base across different regions in India.
   - **Characteristics**: Includes demographic information about respondents and aggregates stereotypes based on identity and attribute terms.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format for further processing or review.
