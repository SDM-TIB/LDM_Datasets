To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Weakly-supervised positional contrastive learning: application to cirrhosis classification" by Emma Sarfati et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant details, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors utilize a large volume of weakly-labeled images and small strongly-labeled datasets for their method, which suggests that datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experiments)**, where the authors specifically mention three datasets of abdominal CT images used in their study. This section is crucial as it provides the necessary details about each dataset, including their characteristics and the type of annotations they contain.

The datasets mentioned are:

1. **Dradio**: This dataset contains 2,799 CT scans with weak radiological annotations indicating four stages of cirrhosis. The breakdown of the stages is provided, which is essential for understanding the dataset's structure.

2. **D1 histo**: This dataset consists of 106 CT scans with histopathological status obtained through histological analysis. The METAVIR score is used for classification, and the dataset is binarized for advanced fibrosis detection.

3. **D2 histo**: This dataset is the public LIHC dataset from the Cancer Genome Atlas, which includes histological scores (Ishak score) and is also binarized for analysis.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The citations I will extract are:

- For **Dradio**, the citation is:
  > Sarfati, E., Bone, A., Rohe, M.M., Gori, P., & Bloch, I. (2023). Learning to diagnose cirrhosis from radiological and histological labels with joint self and weakly-supervised pretraining strategies. In *IEEE ISBI*. Cartagena de Indias, Colombia.

- For **D1 histo**, the citation is:
  > Li, Q., Yu, B., Tian, X., et al. (2020). Deep residual nets model for staging liver fibrosis on plain CT images. *International Journal of Computer Assisted Radiology and Surgery*, 15(6), 1-10.

- For **D2 histo**, the citation is:
  > Erickson, B.J., Kirk, S., Lee, et al. (2016). Radiology data from the cancer genome atlas colon adenocarcinoma [TCGA-COAD] collection.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly presents each dataset along with its citation. This will ensure that the datasets are accurately represented and properly attributed in any subsequent analysis or reporting.
