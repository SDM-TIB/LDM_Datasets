To extract datasets from the research paper titled "RiskOracle: A Minute-level Citywide Traffic Accident Forecasting Framework" by Zhengyang Zhou et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and data description sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on two real-world datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **Empirical Studies section**, particularly the **Data Description subsection**, where the authors provide statistics about the datasets used. Here, they mention two datasets:

1. **NYC Opendata**: This dataset includes various traffic-related records, such as accidents, taxi trips, speed values, weather conditions, demographics, and road network information. The time span for this dataset is from January 1, 2017, to May 31, 2017, and it covers 354 regions with a total of 254,000 accident records.

2. **Suzhou Industrial Park (SIP) dataset**: This dataset contains traffic flows and speeds, along with weather data. The time span for this dataset is from January 1, 2017, to March 31, 2017, and it includes 108 regions with 1,399,000 traffic flow records.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. However, the paper does not provide specific citations for the datasets themselves, as they are likely publicly available datasets. Therefore, I will note that the NYC Opendata can be accessed through the official NYC Open Data portal, and the SIP dataset may be available through local government or transportation agencies in Suzhou.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset names, descriptions, and any relevant statistics, along with the best available citations or access points for each dataset.

In summary, the datasets extracted from the paper are:

1. **NYC Opendata**: 
   - Description: Contains traffic-related records including accidents, taxi trips, speed values, weather, demographics, and road network information.
   - Time Span: January 1, 2017 - May 31, 2017
   - Number of Regions: 354
   - Number of Records: 254,000 accidents
   - Citation: NYC Open Data Portal (https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/)

2. **Suzhou Industrial Park (SIP) dataset**: 
   - Description: Includes traffic flows and speeds, along with weather data.
   - Time Span: January 1, 2017 - March 31, 2017
   - Number of Regions: 108
   - Number of Records: 1,399,000 traffic flow records
   - Citation: Local transportation agency in Suzhou (specific citation not provided in the paper).

With this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for further processing or review.
