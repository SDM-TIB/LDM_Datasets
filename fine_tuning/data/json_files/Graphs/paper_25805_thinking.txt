To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Improving Graph Convolutional Networks with Non-Parametric Activation Functions" by Simone Scardapane et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and while it may not explicitly mention datasets, it sets the context for the experiments conducted.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental setup section** where the authors describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they mention two datasets: **Cora** and **Citeseer**. I will take note of the details provided about these datasets, including their characteristics such as the number of nodes, edges, classes, features, and the percentage of labeled nodes.

I will then refer to the **table (Table I)** that summarizes the datasets, which provides a concise overview of their properties. This table confirms the datasets used in the experiments and provides additional context for their application in semi-supervised learning.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The paper cites other works that describe these datasets, which I will need to include in my extraction.

For the **Cora dataset**, the citation is:
> Z. Yang, W. W. Cohen, and R. Salakhutdinov. "Revisiting semi-supervised learning with graph embeddings." In Proc. 33rd International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML), 2016.

For the **Citeseer dataset**, the citation is:
> T. N. Kipf and M. Welling. "Semi-supervised classification with graph convolutional networks." In Proc. International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR), 2017.

Now that I have gathered all necessary information about the datasets, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and the full citation as required.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ready for further processing or review.
