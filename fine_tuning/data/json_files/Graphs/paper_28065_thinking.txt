To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Self-Paced Contrastive Learning for Semi-supervised Medical Image Segmentation with Meta-labels" by Jizong Peng et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. In the abstract, the authors mention that they validate their approach on **three different medical image segmentation datasets**, which indicates that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experimental setup)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they specifically mention:

1. **Automated Cardiac Diagnosis Challenge (ACDC) dataset**: This dataset is used for cardiac segmentation tasks and is referenced as a benchmark in the paper.

2. **Prostate MR Image Segmentation 2012 Challenge (PROMISE12) dataset**: This dataset is utilized for prostate segmentation tasks and is also a well-known benchmark in the field.

3. **Multi-Modality Whole Heart Segmentation Challenge (MMWHS) dataset**: This dataset is mentioned as another benchmark for segmentation tasks in medical imaging.

In this section, the authors provide additional context about the datasets, including their relevance and the types of meta-labels used for training.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution:

- For the **ACDC dataset**, the citation is:
  > O. Bernard, A. Lalande, C. Zotti, F. Cervenansky, X. Yang, P.-A. Heng, I. Cetin, K. Lekadir, O. Camara, M. A. G. Ballester, et al. *Deep learning techniques for automatic MRI cardiac multi-structures segmentation and diagnosis: Is the problem solved?* IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging, 2018.

- For the **PROMISE12 dataset**, the citation is:
  > G. Litjens, R. Toth, W. van de Ven, C. Hoeks, S. Kerkstra, B. van Ginneken, G. Vincent, G. Guillard, N. Birbeck, J. Zhang, et al. *Evaluation of prostate segmentation algorithms for MRI: the PROMISE12 challenge.* Medical image analysis, 18(2):359–373, 2014.

- For the **MMWHS dataset**, the citation is:
  > X. Zhuang and J. Shen. *Multi-scale patch and multi-modality atlases for whole heart segmentation of MRI.* Medical image analysis, 31:77–87, 2016.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
