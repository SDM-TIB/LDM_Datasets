To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Locally-Aware Constrained Games on Networks" by Guanze Peng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections that discuss experiments or case studies**. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, but it may not explicitly mention datasets. Therefore, I will pay close attention to the **introduction** and **case studies** sections, as these are likely to contain references to any datasets used in the research.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of applying game theory to networks and mention the use of a locally-aware constrained game framework. However, there is no direct mention of specific datasets here.

Next, I will examine the **case studies section** (Section V) where the authors present examples to corroborate their analytical results. In this section, they refer to **Cournot Games** and **Bertrand Games** as case studies. However, they do not specify any datasets used for these examples, as they seem to be theoretical constructs rather than empirical studies based on specific datasets.

I will also check the **references section** to see if any datasets are cited indirectly through the literature. The references include various papers related to game theory and network systems, but they do not explicitly mention datasets.

After reviewing the entire paper, it appears that the authors do not utilize any specific datasets for their analysis. Instead, they focus on theoretical frameworks and case studies that do not rely on empirical data.

Since no datasets are identified in the paper, I will not be able to provide full citations for datasets as there are none to report. 

In conclusion, I will summarize my findings, noting that while the paper discusses concepts and frameworks related to locally-aware constrained games, it does not reference any specific datasets used in the research.
