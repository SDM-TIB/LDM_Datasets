To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Dissecting Medical Referral Mechanisms in Health Services: Role of Physician Professional Networks" by Regina de Brito Duarte et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study uses "five-year consultation data from a Portuguese private health provider," which suggests that a specific dataset is being utilized.

Next, I will focus on the **Materials and Methods section**, particularly **section 3.1 (Data Collection and Data Preprocessing)**, where the authors describe the dataset in detail. Here, they mention that the dataset consists of over **12 million consultations** involving **1.4 million patients** and **3,632 physicians**. This is a significant dataset that is central to their analysis.

The authors also clarify that the data includes patient demographics and physician characteristics, which further emphasizes the dataset's richness. However, they do not provide a specific name for this dataset, as it is described as an anonymized research dataset provided by a health provider.

Since the dataset is not publicly available, I will note that it is accessible upon reasonable request from the corresponding author, as stated in the **Data Availability Statement**. This is important for transparency and for any future researchers who may wish to access the data.

Now, I will check the **References section** to see if there are any citations related to the dataset or similar datasets used in the study. However, the paper does not cite any specific datasets outside of the one they collected, which is unique to their research.

In summary, I will document the dataset as follows:

1. **Dataset Name**: Anonymized consultation dataset from a Portuguese private health provider.
   - **Description**: This dataset consists of over 12 million consultations involving 1.4 million patients and 3,632 physicians, including demographic information and consultation details.
   - **Citation**: Not publicly available; accessible upon reasonable request from the corresponding author (Claudia Soares, claudia.soares@fct.unl.pt).

With this information, I will compile the dataset entry for further processing or review.
