To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MethaneMapper: Spectral Absorption aware Hyperspectral Transformer for Methane Detection" by Satish Kumar et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant details, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors introduce a large-scale dataset of methane plume segmentation masks, which suggests that there is a dataset to extract.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors discuss the challenges of detecting methane emissions and mention the need for public training data. They introduce the **Methane Hot Spots (MHS) dataset**, which is described as the largest of its kind available for computer vision researchers. This section provides a clear indication of the dataset's significance.

In the **experiments section**, particularly in **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, the authors provide detailed statistics about the MHS dataset, including the number of plume sites, flight lines, and the time period covered. They also mention another dataset, the **JPL-CH4-detection-V1.0 dataset**, which is the only publicly available dataset with annotations for CH4 plume detection.

Now, I will gather the necessary details for each dataset:

1. **Methane Hot Spots (MHS) Dataset**:
   - Description: Contains methane segmentation masks for over 1200 AVIRIS-NG flight lines from 2015 to 2022, with approximately 4000 plume sites.
   - Citation: The paper does not provide a formal citation for the MHS dataset since it is introduced by the authors themselves.

2. **JPL-CH4-detection-V1.0 Dataset**:
   - Description: Contains 46 AVIRIS-NG flight lines in the US Four-Corners region, which is the only currently publicly available dataset with methane plume segmentation masks.
   - Citation: 
     > David R. Thompson, Anuj Karpatne, Imme Ebert-Uphoff, Christian Frankenberg, Andrew K. Thorpe, Brian D. Bue, and Robert O. Green. *Isgeo dataset jpl-ch4-detection-2017-v1.0: A benchmark for methane source detection from imaging spectrometer data*. 2017.

After identifying these datasets and their citations, I will compile the information into a structured format that highlights the key attributes of each dataset, ensuring that the full citations are included for proper referencing. This will facilitate further analysis or integration into other research efforts.
