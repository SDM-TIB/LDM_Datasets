To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Modeling Gate-Level Abstraction Hierarchy Using Graph Convolutional Neural Networks to Predict Functional De-Rating Factors" by Aneesh Balakrishnan et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the model is validated on two circuits, which suggests that there may be datasets related to these circuits.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **results section**. The authors describe the validation of their model on two circuits: the **IEEE 754 standard double precision floating point adder** and the **10-Gigabit Ethernet MAC IEEE 802.3 standard**. I need to confirm if these circuits are associated with publicly available datasets or if they are original datasets created for this research.

In the **results section**, the authors mention that the double precision floating point adder circuit is available on the **OpenCores website**. This indicates that there is a dataset associated with this circuit. I will need to find the exact reference for this dataset.

For the **10-Gigabit Ethernet MAC**, the authors also state that this circuit is accessible from OpenCores. This suggests that there is another dataset associated with this circuit as well.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

1. For the **IEEE 754 standard double precision floating point adder**, the citation is:
   > OpenCores. *Double Precision Floating Point Adder*. Available: https://opencores.org/projects/dp_floating_point_adder.

2. For the **10-Gigabit Ethernet MAC**, the citation is:
   > OpenCores. *10-Gigabit Ethernet MAC*. Available: https://opencores.org/projects/10g_ethernet_mac.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as they are crucial for proper attribution and reference.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for further processing or review.
