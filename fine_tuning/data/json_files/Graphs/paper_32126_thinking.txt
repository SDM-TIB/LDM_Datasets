To extract datasets from the research paper titled "RB-Dust – A Reference-based Dataset for Vision-based Dust Removal" by Peter Buckel et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** to identify any datasets that are introduced. The abstract mentions the creation of the **RB-Dust dataset**, which is specifically designed for validating dust removal methods in agriculture. This indicates that there is at least one dataset to extract.

Next, I will move to the **introduction** section, where the authors elaborate on the challenges posed by dust in agricultural settings and the need for a dataset that includes both dusty and dust-free images. They confirm the existence of the **RB-Dust dataset** and its purpose.

In **section 3 (RB-Dust Dataset)**, the authors provide detailed information about the dataset, including its structure and contents. They specify that the dataset contains **200 images** captured under controlled conditions, which include both dusty and dust-free images taken from the same position. This section is crucial as it provides the specifics needed for describing the dataset.

I will also check the **experiments** section to see if the authors mention any other datasets used for comparison or validation. However, the focus remains on the **RB-Dust dataset**, which is validated using various image enhancement algorithms.

Finally, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citation for the **RB-Dust dataset**. The authors do not provide a separate citation for the dataset itself, as it is introduced in their own work. Therefore, I will use the citation for the paper itself as the authoritative source for the dataset:

- For **RB-Dust Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Peter Buckel, Timo Oksanen, Thomas Dietmueller. *RB-Dust – A Reference-based Dataset for Vision-based Dust Removal*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP), 2023.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and the full citation as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the dataset extracted from the paper.
