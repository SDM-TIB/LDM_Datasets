To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The Pitfalls of Sample Selection: A Case Study on Lung Nodule Classification" by Vasileios Baltatzis et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract highlights the use of the **LIDC dataset** for lung nodule classification, indicating that this is a key dataset in the study.

Next, I will examine the **state-of-the-art section** and **methodology** to see if there are any additional datasets mentioned or if the authors provide more details about the LIDC dataset. The introduction mentions that the LIDC dataset is widely used in lung nodule classification, which reinforces its importance.

In the **methodology section**, the authors describe how they preprocess the LIDC dataset, including steps like retaining only nodules annotated by at least three radiologists and removing indeterminate nodules. This section provides valuable context about how the dataset is utilized in their experiments.

I will also check the **experimental analysis** section for any references to other datasets or variations of the LIDC dataset. However, it appears that the focus remains on the LIDC dataset throughout the paper.

Finally, I will consult the **references section** to find the full citation for the LIDC dataset. The relevant citation is:

- **LIDC Dataset**: 
  > Armato, S.G., McLennan, G., Bidaut, L., et al. "The Lung Image Database Consortium (LIDC) and Image Database Resource Initiative (IDRI): A completed reference database of lung nodules on CT scans." *Medical Physics* 38(2), 915â€“931 (2011). https://doi.org/10.1118/1.3528204

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will prepare to compile this information into the required format for further processing. The LIDC dataset is the primary focus of this paper, and its citation is crucial for proper attribution in any subsequent work.
