To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Exploring Visual Relationship for Image Captioning" by Ting Yao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that extensive experiments were conducted on the **COCO image captioning dataset** and that **Visual Genome** was used for pre-training the object detector and semantic relation detector. This indicates that these two datasets are significant for the research.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section**, specifically **section 4.1 (Datasets and Experimental Settings)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used:

1. **COCO Dataset**: The paper describes it as the most popular benchmark for image captioning, containing 82,783 training images and 40,504 validation images, with 5 human-annotated descriptions per image. This dataset is crucial for evaluating the performance of their proposed model.

2. **Visual Genome**: This dataset is characterized as a large-scale image dataset for modeling interactions and relationships between objects, containing 108K images with densely annotated objects, attributes, and relationships. It is used to pre-train the object detector and semantic relation detector.

After identifying these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **COCO dataset**, the citation is:
  > Chen, X., Fang, H., Lin, T.Y., Vedantam, R., Gupta, S., DollÃ¡r, P., & Zitnick, C.L. (2015). Microsoft COCO captions: Data collection and evaluation server. arXiv preprint arXiv:1504.00325.

- For the **Visual Genome**, the citation is:
  > Krishna, R., Zhu, Y., Groth, O., Johnson, J., Hata, K., Kravitz, J., Chen, S., Kalantidis, Y., Li, L.J., Shamma, D.A., et al. (2017). Visual genome: Connecting language and vision using crowdsourced dense image annotations. IJCV.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research along with their proper citations.
