To extract datasets from the research paper titled "4DContrast: Contrastive Learning with Dynamic Correspondences for 3D Scene Understanding" by Yujin Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors use **ScanNet** and **ModelNet** for their experiments, which suggests that these datasets are significant to the research.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **Datasets** section or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experimental setup** sections. In the introduction, the authors mention leveraging **ScanNet** for unsupervised 3D representation learning and using **ModelNet** shapes for data augmentation. This confirms that both datasets are utilized in their approach.

In the **experimental setup** section, the authors provide more details about how they use these datasets. They specify that they use **ScanNet** with 1201 training scans and augment it with shapes from **ModelNet**. This information is crucial for understanding the context in which these datasets are used.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. **ScanNet**:
   > Dai, A., Chang, A.X., Savva, M., Halber, M., Funkhouser, T., Nießner, M. "ScanNet: Richly-annotated 3D reconstructions of indoor scenes." In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pp. 5828–5839, 2017.

2. **ModelNet**:
   > Wu, Z., Song, S., Khosla, A., Yu, F., Zhang, L., Tang, X., Xiao, J. "3D ShapeNets: A deep representation for volumetric shapes." In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pp. 1912–1920, 2015.

With these citations in hand, I can now summarize the datasets:

- **ScanNet**: A dataset consisting of richly annotated 3D reconstructions of indoor scenes, used for training and evaluating 3D scene understanding tasks.
- **ModelNet**: A dataset of 3D shapes used for data augmentation in the context of 3D representation learning.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly presents each dataset along with its citation, ensuring that all details are accurately captured for future reference or processing.
