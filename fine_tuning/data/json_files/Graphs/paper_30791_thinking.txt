To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Theoretical Study of Inductive Biases in Contrastive Learning" by Jeff Z. HaoChen and Tengyu Ma, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a high-level overview, and the introduction often discusses the context and relevance of datasets used in the research.

Next, I will look for any **specific sections that might detail datasets**, such as a dedicated "Datasets" section or any mention of datasets in the "Experiments" or "Results" sections. These sections typically provide the most information about the datasets used, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

As I read through these sections, I will take note of any datasets that are referenced. For example, if the authors mention using a specific dataset for their experiments, I will record its name and any relevant details provided, such as the number of samples, types of data, and any specific characteristics that are highlighted.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial, as proper citation is necessary for academic integrity and allows others to locate the datasets easily. I will look for the original papers or sources that describe the datasets in detail.

For each dataset identified, I will compile the following information:
1. **Dataset Name**: The official name of the dataset as mentioned in the paper.
2. **Description**: A brief description of the dataset, including its purpose and any notable features.
3. **Full Citation**: The complete reference for the dataset, including authors, title, publication venue, and year.

Once I have gathered all this information, I will organize it clearly, ensuring that each dataset is well-documented with its corresponding citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I capture all relevant datasets accurately and comprehensively.
