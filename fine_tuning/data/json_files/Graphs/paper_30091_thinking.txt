To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MvDeCor: Multi-view Dense Correspondence Learning for Fine-grained 3D Segmentation" by Gopal Sharma et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on "textured (RenderPeople) and untextured (PartNet) 3D datasets," which suggests that these datasets are crucial for their research.

Next, I will look into **section 4 (Experiments and Results)**, specifically **subsection 4.1 (Dataset)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they explicitly mention:

1. **PartNet Dataset**: This dataset is noted for providing fine-grained semantic segmentation annotations for various 3D shape categories. The authors specify that they used 17 categories from "level-3" segmentation, which is the finest level of detail.

2. **RenderPeople Dataset**: The authors describe this dataset as containing 1000 human textured models represented as triangle meshes in two poses. They used 936 shapes for self-supervision and labeled 64 shapes with 13 different semantic labels.

3. **ShapeNet-Part Dataset**: Although mentioned briefly, the authors indicate that they also conducted experiments on this dataset, which is known for its part-level segmentation tasks.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **PartNet Dataset**:
  > Mo, K., Zhu, S., Chang, A.X., Yi, L., Tripathi, S., Guibas, L.J., Su, H. (2019). *PartNet: A Large-Scale Benchmark for Fine-Grained and Hierarchical Part-Level 3D Object Understanding*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR).

- For **RenderPeople Dataset**:

- For **ShapeNet-Part Dataset**:

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations.
