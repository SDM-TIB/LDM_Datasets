To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Neural Architecture Retrieval" by Xiaohuan Pei et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that a dataset containing **12k real-world network architectures** is built for neural architecture retrieval. This indicates that there is a significant dataset involved.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for further details about the datasets. The introduction discusses the importance of neural architecture designs and mentions the existence of numerous architectures available on various platforms, hinting at the datasets used.

I will then focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, specifically **subsection 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors provide explicit details about the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention:

1. **Real-world Neural Architectures Dataset**: This dataset consists of **12,517 real-world neural architecture designs** collected from public repositories. It includes various deep learning tasks and provides details such as model name, repository name, task name, graph edges, FLOPs, and parameters.

2. **NAS Architectures Dataset**: This dataset contains **30,000 neural architectures** generated by algorithms, following the search space of DARTS. The architectures are categorized into **10 classes** based on graph editing distance.

In the **References section**, I will look for full citations for the datasets mentioned. However, since the datasets are built by the authors themselves and not from external sources, I will note that the citations for these datasets will be based on the paper itself:

- For the **Real-world Neural Architectures Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Xiaohuan Pei, Yanxi Li, Minjing Dong, and Chang Xu. *Neural Architecture Retrieval*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR), 2024.

- For the **NAS Architectures Dataset**, the citation is the same as above since it is part of the same work.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its full citation.
