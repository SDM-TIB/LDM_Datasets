To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Black-Box Approximation and Optimization with Hierarchical Tucker Decomposition" by Gleb Ryzhakov et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the development of a new method (HTBB) and numerical experiments on 14 complex model problems, which suggests that there may be datasets involved, but I need to look for specific names.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** in detail, particularly **section 5 (Numerical Experiments)**, where the authors discuss the benchmarks used for their experiments. They mention using "14 popular 256-dimensional benchmarks" and provide a table (Table 1) that lists these benchmark functions along with their bounds and analytical formulas. This is a strong indication that these benchmarks are the datasets I need to extract.

In **Table 1**, the authors list the following benchmark functions:

1. **Alpine**: Bounds [-10, 10]
2. **Chung**: Bounds [-10, 10]
3. **Dixon**: Bounds [-10, 10]
4. **Griewank**: Bounds [-100, 100]
5. **Pathological**: Bounds [-100, 100]
6. **Pinter**: Bounds [-10, 10]
7. **Qing**: Bounds [0, 500]
8. **Rastrigin**: Bounds [-5.12, 5.12]
9. **Schaffer**: Bounds [-100, 100]
10. **Schwefel**: Bounds [0, 500]
11. **Sphere**: Bounds [-5.12, 5.12]
12. **Squares**: Bounds [-10, 10]
13. **Trigonometric**: Bounds [0, π]
14. **Wavy**: Bounds [-π, π]

Next, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for these benchmark functions. However, the paper does not provide specific dataset citations for these benchmarks, as they are commonly used functions in optimization literature. Therefore, I will reference the original sources where these benchmarks are typically discussed.

For example, the authors cite Jamil & Yang (2013) for a literature survey of benchmark functions, which can serve as a general citation for these datasets. The citation is:

- Jamil, M., & Yang, X.-S. (2013). A literature survey of benchmark functions for global optimization problems. *Journal of Mathematical Modelling and Numerical Optimisation*, 4(2), 150–194.

Now, I will compile the extracted datasets and their citations into a structured format, ensuring that I include the relevant details for each benchmark function as well as the overarching citation for the source of these benchmarks.

After completing this process, I will have a comprehensive list of datasets extracted from the paper, ready for further analysis or processing.
