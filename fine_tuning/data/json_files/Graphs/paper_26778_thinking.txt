To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Robust Node Representations on Graphs" by Xu Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions "extensive experiments on four benchmarks," which indicates that datasets are likely discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Dataset Description)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention four benchmarks:

1. **Pubmed**: A widely used citation network dataset.
2. **Facebook**: A dataset consisting of official Facebook pages and their mutual connections.
3. **Coauthor-CS**: A coauthor dataset with raw node features and class labels.
4. **Coauthor-Phy**: Another coauthor dataset similar to Coauthor-CS, but used for inductive learning.

In this section, the authors provide additional context about how these datasets are utilized in their experiments, including the learning setups (transductive and inductive) and the specific splits for training, validation, and testing.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **Pubmed**, the citation is:
  > Shchur, O., Mumme, M., Bojchevski, A., & Günnemann, S. (2018). Pitfalls of graph neural network evaluation. *arXiv preprint arXiv:1811.05868*.

- For **Facebook**, the citation is:
  > Rozemberczki, B., Allen, C., & Sarkar, R. (2019). Multi-scale attributed node embedding. *arXiv preprint arXiv:1906.04224*.

- For **Coauthor-CS**, the citation is:
  > Shchur, O., Mumme, M., Bojchevski, A., & Günnemann, S. (2018). Pitfalls of graph neural network evaluation. *arXiv preprint arXiv:1811.05868*.

- For **Coauthor-Phy**, the citation is:
  > Shchur, O., Mumme, M., Bojchevski, A., & Günnemann, S. (2018). Pitfalls of graph neural network evaluation. *arXiv preprint arXiv:1811.05868*.

Since the Coauthor datasets are referenced from the same source, I will ensure to note that they share the same citation.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation, ready for structured output or further processing.
