To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Prompt-guided Scene Generation for 3D Zero-Shot Learning" by Majid Nasiri et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions achieving state-of-the-art performance on synthetic and real-scanned 3D object datasets, which indicates that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental setup section** where the authors describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they explicitly mention three datasets:

1. **ModelNet40**: This dataset consists of 40 classes of 3D models and is used for training and testing in the zero-shot learning context. The paper states that it has a total of 5852 training samples and 1560 validation samples.

2. **ModelNet10**: This is a subset of ModelNet40, containing 10 classes. The paper does not specify the number of samples used for training and validation, but it is mentioned that it is used for testing unseen classes.

3. **ScanObjectNN**: This dataset consists of real-world 3D point cloud data with background noise. The paper indicates that it has 15 classes, with 908 samples for testing.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **ModelNet40**, the citation is:
  > Wu, Z., Song, S., Khosla, A., Yu, F., Zhang, L., Tang, X., & Xiao, J. (2015). *3D ShapeNets: A Deep Representation for Volumetric Shapes*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2015.

- For **ModelNet10**, the citation is the same as ModelNet40 since it is a subset of that dataset:
  > Wu, Z., Song, S., Khosla, A., Yu, F., Zhang, L., Tang, X., & Xiao, J. (2015). *3D ShapeNets: A Deep Representation for Volumetric Shapes*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2015.

- For **ScanObjectNN**, the citation is:
  > Uy, M. A., Pham, Q.-H., Hua, B.-S., Nguyen, T., & Yeung, S.-K. (2019). *Revisiting Point Cloud Classification: A New Benchmark Dataset and Classification Model on Real-World Data*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2019.

Now that I have gathered the dataset names and their corresponding citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their references as required.
