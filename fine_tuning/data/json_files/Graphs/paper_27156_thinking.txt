To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SUSPICIOUS MASSIVE REGISTRATION DETECTION VIA DYNAMIC HETEROGENEOUS GRAPH NEURAL NETWORKS" by Susie Xi Rao et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the construction of a dynamic heterogeneous graph from registration data, which suggests that a dataset is involved, but I need to find specific details.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Dataset, Preprocessing and Evaluation Metric)**, where the authors describe the dataset used for their experiments. They mention that the dataset consists of account registrations from an e-commerce platform, specifically from September to December 2019. This section provides crucial information about the dataset's context and characteristics.

The authors state that out of 111,691 account registrations, 63,161 accounts are flagged as suspicious. They also describe the features included in the dataset, such as registration profiles, registration behavior patterns, and transaction patterns. This detailed description helps in understanding the dataset's structure and purpose.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. However, the paper does not provide a specific dataset citation like traditional datasets (e.g., Penn Action Dataset). Instead, it describes the dataset as being derived from real-time account creation logs from an e-commerce platform, which may not have a formal citation.

Since the dataset is based on internal data from an e-commerce platform, I will note that it is not publicly available and does not have a formal citation. However, I will still document the dataset's details as follows:

1. **Dataset Name**: E-commerce Account Registration Dataset
   - **Description**: A dataset containing account registration records from an e-commerce platform, sampled from September to December 2019. It includes features such as registration email, username, text patterns in addresses, IP location, registration behavior patterns, and transaction patterns.
   - **Size**: 111,691 account registrations, with 63,161 flagged as suspicious.

Since there is no formal citation for this dataset, I will note that it is derived from internal logs and does not have a publicly accessible reference.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format for clarity and future reference.
