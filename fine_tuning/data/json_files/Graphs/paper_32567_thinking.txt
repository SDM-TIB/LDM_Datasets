To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Context Aware Query Rewriting for Text Rankers using LLM" by Abhijit Anand et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets along with their full citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction typically outlines the problem and context, which may include references to datasets used in the study.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets they utilized. In this section, the authors mention several datasets:

1. **TREC Web Track Datasets**: The authors collected topics and corresponding descriptions from TREC web tracks from 2009 to 2011, which were used for fine-tuning the generative model. They obtained 1143 samples for training, 126 for validation, and 103 for testing.

2. **Google People Also Asked (PAA) Data**: This dataset was collected to provide expanded versions of ambiguous queries. The authors mention that these texts serve as external knowledge for each query.

3. **MS MARCO (Passage and Document Datasets)**: The authors used the passage dataset from the TREC Deep Learning track (2019) for evaluating their model. They selected 1200 ambiguous queries from TREC-DL-19 for training and used the same method for the document dataset.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **TREC Web Track Datasets**, the citation is:
  > Charles LA Clarke, Nick Craswell, and Ian Soboroff. *Overview of the TREC 2009 Web Track*. [n. d.].

- For the **MS MARCO Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Payal Bajaj, Daniel Campos, Nick Craswell, et al. *MS MARCO: A Human Generated MAchine Reading COmprehension Dataset*. In Proceedings of the Workshop on Cognitive Computation: Integrating neural and symbolic approaches 2016 co-located with the 30th Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS 2016), Barcelona, Spain, December 9, 2016.

- The **Google People Also Asked (PAA) Data** does not have a specific citation in the references, as it is a collection of questions sourced from Google.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
