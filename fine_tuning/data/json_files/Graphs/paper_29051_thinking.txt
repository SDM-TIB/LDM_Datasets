To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-View Graph Representation for Programming Language Processing: An Investigation into Algorithm Detection" by Ting Long et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors use a public dataset called **POJ-104** and also construct a new dataset named **ALG-109** for their experiments. This is a clear indication that I need to gather more details about these datasets.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** where the authors provide descriptions of the datasets used. They mention:

1. **POJ-104**: This dataset is described as containing source code solutions for algorithmic programming problems on the Peking University online judge. It consists of 52,000 programs labeled with algorithmic problem IDs, corresponding to a multi-class single-label classification problem with 104 classes.

2. **ALG-109**: This is a newly constructed dataset that contains 11,913 pieces of source code collected from the CSDN website. Each program is labeled with the algorithms and data structures present in the source code, making it a multi-class multi-label classification problem with 109 classes.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The paper cites the following:

- For **POJ-104**, the citation is:
  > Mou, L., Li, G., Zhang, L., Wang, T., & Jin, Z. (2016). Convolutional neural networks over tree structures for programming language processing. In Thirtieth AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence.

- For **ALG-109**, since it is a newly constructed dataset by the authors, I will note that it does not have a separate citation but will reference the paper itself as the source.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.
