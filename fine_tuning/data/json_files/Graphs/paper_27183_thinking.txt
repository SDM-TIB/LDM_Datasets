To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Spatial Contrastive Learning for Few-Shot Classification" by Yassine Ouali, Céline Hudelot, and Myriam Tami, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments on standard and cross-domain few-shot classification benchmarks. This indicates that there are specific datasets used in their experiments.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors describe their experiments in section 4, where they mention using several benchmarks for evaluation. 

In the **experiments section (4.1)**, the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments:

1. **mini-ImageNet**: A widely used benchmark for few-shot learning, consisting of 100 classes with 600 images per class, split into training, validation, and test sets.
2. **tiered-ImageNet**: A larger subset of ImageNet with 608 classes, organized into 34 super-categories, also split into training, validation, and test sets.
3. **CIFAR-FS**: A few-shot learning benchmark derived from CIFAR-100, containing 100 classes.
4. **FC100**: Another CIFAR-100 derivative, structured into super-categories for few-shot learning.
5. **CUB**: The Caltech-UCSD Birds dataset, used for cross-domain evaluation.
6. **Cars**: The Cars dataset, also used for cross-domain evaluation.
7. **Places**: The Places dataset, used for cross-domain evaluation.
8. **Plantae**: Another dataset used for cross-domain evaluation.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. The citations typically include the authors, title, source, and year of publication. 

For example, the citation for **mini-ImageNet** is:
> Vinyals, O., Blundell, C., Lillicrap, T., Wierstra, D. (2016). *Matching networks for one shot learning*. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems.

Similarly, I will find citations for the other datasets:

- **tiered-ImageNet**:

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described with its full citation, ready for structured output or further processing.
