To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Graph Neural Networks: A Review of Methods and Applications" by Jie Zhou et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract and introduction** sections of the paper. These sections often provide a summary of the key contributions and may mention specific datasets used in the research. I will look for any explicit references to datasets or benchmarks.

Next, I will proceed to the **methods and applications sections**. These sections typically detail the experiments conducted and the datasets utilized. I will carefully read through these parts to identify any datasets that are explicitly named or described. If the authors mention specific datasets, I will note their names and any relevant details provided about them.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** of the paper to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial as it provides the necessary context and source for the datasets mentioned. I will ensure that I capture the complete citation format as presented in the references.

For each dataset identified, I will summarize the following information:
1. **Name of the dataset**: The exact name as mentioned in the paper.
2. **Description**: A brief overview of what the dataset contains, including its purpose and any relevant statistics (e.g., number of samples, types of data).
3. **Full citation**: The complete reference for the dataset as found in the references section of the paper.

Once I have compiled this information, I will organize it clearly, ensuring that each dataset is well-documented with its name, description, and citation. This structured approach will help in accurately extracting and presenting the datasets used in the research paper.
