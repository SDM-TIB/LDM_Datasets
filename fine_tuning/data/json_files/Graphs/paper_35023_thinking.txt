To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Contrastive Learning Is Not Optimal for Quasiperiodic Time Series" by Adrian Atienza et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and evaluation sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the introduction of a new method (DEAPS) for quasiperiodic time series, specifically highlighting its application to electrocardiogram (ECG) data. This suggests that datasets related to ECG may be involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors discuss the challenges of self-supervised learning (SSL) in time series analysis and mention various datasets used in their experiments. I will look for specific names of datasets mentioned in this section.

In the **evaluation section**, the authors detail their experiments and explicitly list the datasets used for testing their method. They mention four databases: 

1. **MIT-BIH Atrial Fibrillation Database (MIT-AFIB)**: This dataset is used for evaluating atrial fibrillation identification.
2. **MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database (MIT-ARR)**: This dataset is used for training and testing the model on arrhythmia detection.
3. **Physionet Challenge 2017 (Cinc2017)**: This dataset is used for assessing the scalability of the representations.
4. **Sleep Heart Health Study (SHHS)**: This dataset is used for training the model.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for each of these datasets:

- For the **MIT-BIH Atrial Fibrillation Database (MIT-AFIB)**, the citation is:
  > Moody, G.B., & Mark, R.G. (1983). A new method for detecting atrial fibrillation using R-R intervals. *Computers in Cardiology*, 227-230.

- For the **MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database (MIT-ARR)**, the citation is:
  > Moody, G.B., & Mark, R.G. (1983). A new method for detecting atrial fibrillation using R-R intervals. *Computers in Cardiology*, 227-230.

- For the **Physionet Challenge 2017 (Cinc2017)**, the citation is:
  > Clifford, G.D., Liu, C., Moody, B., Lehman, L.H., Silva, I., Li, Q., Johnson, A.E., & Mark, R.G. (2017). AF classification from a short single lead ECG recording: The PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology Challenge 2017. In *2017 Computing in Cardiology (CinC)*, 1-4.

- For the **Sleep Heart Health Study (SHHS)**, the citation is:
  > Quan, S.F., Howard, B.J., Iber, C., Kiley, J., Nieto, F.J., Oâ€™Connor, G.T., Rapoport, D.M., Redline, S., Robbins, J.A., Samet, J.M., & Wahl, P. (1998). The Sleep Heart Health Study: Design, rationale, and methods. *Sleep*, 20(12), 1077-1085.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will allow for a clear understanding of the datasets used in the research and their relevance to the proposed method.
