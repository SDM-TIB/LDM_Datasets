To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Spatial-Aware Token for Weakly Supervised Object Localization" by Pingyu Wu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. In the abstract, the authors mention that their method achieves state-of-the-art performance on **CUB-200** and **ImageNet** datasets. This indicates that these datasets are likely used in their experiments.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In the **experimental setup** section, the authors explicitly list the datasets they evaluated their method on:

1. **CUB-200**: This dataset is described as a fine-grained dataset with 200 bird species, consisting of 5,994 images for training and 5,794 images for testing.

2. **ImageNet**: This dataset contains about 1.2 million training images and 50,000 validation images from 1,000 different classes.

3. **OpenImages**: This dataset includes 100 categories, with 29,819 training samples, 2,500 validation samples, and 5,000 test samples.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **CUB-200**, the citation is:
  > Wah, C., Branson, S., Welinder, P., Perona, P., & Belongie, S. (2011). *The Caltech-UCSD Birds-200-2011 dataset*. 

- For **ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Russakovsky, O., Deng, J., Su, H., Krause, J., Satheesh, S., Ma, S., Huang, Z., Karpathy, A., Khosla, A., Bernstein, M., et al. (2015). *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 115(3), 211-252.

- For **OpenImages**, the citation is:
  > Kuznetsova, A., Rom, H., Alldrin, N., et al. (2020). *Open Images: A public dataset for large-scale multi-label image classification*. 

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited according to the requirements.

This structured approach will ensure that I capture all relevant datasets mentioned in the paper along with their full citations, which is crucial for proper attribution and further research.
