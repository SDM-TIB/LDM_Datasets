To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-Grained Angle Representation for Remote Sensing Object Detection" by Hao Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that "extensive experiments are performed on several public remote sensing datasets," which indicates that multiple datasets are used. This is a good starting point for identifying the datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically provide detailed information about the datasets used. In this case, the authors mention five public datasets in the **Experiments and Analysis** section:

1. **HRSC2016**: This dataset is described as an oriented ship detection dataset with 2976 ship targets, divided into training, validation, and testing sets.

2. **DOSR**: This dataset is for oriented ship recognition, containing 1066 optical remote sensing images and 6127 ship instances.

3. **UCAS-AOD**: This dataset includes 1510 aerial images of airplanes and cars, divided into training, validation, and testing sets.

4. **DIOR-R**: This dataset consists of 23463 images with OBB-based annotations, containing 190288 object instances across 20 classes.

5. **DOTA**: This dataset is a large-scale dataset for object detection in aerial images, containing 2806 images with 15 classes.

Now, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will facilitate further research and application of the findings presented in the paper.
