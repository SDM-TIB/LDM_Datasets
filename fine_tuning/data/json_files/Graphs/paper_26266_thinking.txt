To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Graph Mask Convolutional Network" by Bo Jiang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that experiments were conducted on several datasets, which indicates that I should look for specific names and details.

Next, I will focus on **section 6 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they mention five datasets: **Cora**, **Citeseer**, **Cora-ML**, **Amazon Computers**, and **Amazon Photo**. I will take note of the details provided for each dataset, including the number of nodes, edges, feature dimensions, and class labels.

In this section, the authors provide the following details:

1. **Cora**: Contains 2708 nodes and 5429 edges, with a feature descriptor of 1433 dimensions and six classes.
2. **Citeseer**: Contains 3327 nodes and 4732 edges, with a feature descriptor of 3703 dimensions and six classes.
3. **Amazon Computers**: Contains 13381 nodes and 259159 edges, with a feature descriptor of 767 dimensions and ten classes.
4. **Amazon Photo**: Contains 7487 nodes and 126530 edges, with a feature descriptor of 745 dimensions and eight classes.
5. **Cora-ML**: Contains 2810 nodes and 7981 edges, with a feature descriptor of 2879 dimensions and seven classes.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The authors reference the datasets as follows:

- For **Cora**, the citation is:
  > Sen, P., Namata, G., Bilgic, M., Getoor, L., Galligher, B., & Eliassi-Rad, T. (2008). Collective classification in network data. *AI Magazine*, 29(3), 93.

- For **Citeseer**, the citation is:
  > Sen, P., Namata, G., Bilgic, M., Getoor, L., Galligher, B., & Eliassi-Rad, T. (2008). Collective classification in network data. *AI Magazine*, 29(3), 93.

- For **Cora-ML**, the citation is:
  > McCallum, A. K., Nigam, K., Rennie, J., & Seymore, K. (2000). Automating the construction of internet portals with machine learning. *Information Retrieval*, 3(2), 127-163.

- For **Amazon Computers** and **Amazon Photo**, the citation is:
  > McAuley, J., Targett, C., Shi, Q., & Van Den Hengel, A. (2015). Image-based recommendations on styles and substitutes. In *Proceedings of the 38th International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval*, 43-52.

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
