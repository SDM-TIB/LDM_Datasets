To extract datasets from the research paper titled "D3G: Exploring Gaussian Prior for Temporal Sentence Grounding with Glance Annotation" by Hanjun Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted extensive experiments on three challenging benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, specifically **subsection 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention:

1. **Charades-STA**: This dataset is built on the Charades dataset and contains 12,408 training and 3,720 testing moment-sentence pairs.
2. **TACoS**: This dataset consists of 127 videos from the MPII Cooking Composite Activities video corpus, with 10,146 training, 4,589 validation, and 4,083 testing moment-sentence pairs.
3. **ActivityNet Captions**: Originally designed for video captioning, this dataset includes 37,417 training, 17,505 validation, and 17,031 testing moment-sentence pairs.

To ensure accuracy, I will verify the details of each dataset in the **References section** to obtain the full citations:

- For **Charades-STA**, the citation is:
  > Jiyang Gao, Chen Sun, Zhenheng Yang, and Ram Nevatia. *Tall: Temporal activity localization via language query*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision, pages 5267–5275, 2017.

- For **TACoS**, the citation is:
  > Ranjay Krishna, Kenji Hata, Frederic Ren, Li Fei-Fei, and Juan Carlos Niebles. *Dense-captioning events in videos*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision, pages 706–715, 2017.

- For **ActivityNet Captions**, the citation is:
  > Ranjay Krishna, Kenji Hata, Frederic Ren, Li Fei-Fei, and Juan Carlos Niebles. *Dense-captioning events in videos*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision, pages 706–715, 2017.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
