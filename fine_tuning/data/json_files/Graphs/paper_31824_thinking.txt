To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Cooperating Graph Neural Networks with Deep Reinforcement Learning for Vaccine Prioritization" by Lu Ling et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on vaccine prioritization strategies, but I need to look for specific datasets used in the research.

Next, I will examine the **related work and system dynamics framework sections** to see if the authors reference any datasets that were used in previous studies or as part of their own methodology. This could include datasets related to disease dynamics, mobility patterns, or vaccination data.

In the **evaluation section**, the authors mention using real-world data from Marion County during the COVID-19 pandemic. I will look for specific details about this dataset, including its size, structure, and any relevant characteristics that are described.

I will also check the **references section** for any citations that pertain to datasets. This is crucial for obtaining full citations for any datasets mentioned in the paper.

From my reading, I will identify the following datasets:

1. **Mobile Phone Data**: This dataset captures individual movement within Marion County during March 2020, which is used to model mobility dynamics. The authors mention that they obtained 1,812,266 trips and 176,856 users from this dataset.

2. **Disease Data in Marion County**: The authors use disease data from January to August 2021 to calibrate their model. This dataset includes information on daily new cases and deaths during the COVID-19 period.

Next, I will compile the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Mobile Phone Data**, the citation is:
  > U.S. Census Bureau. 2021. American Community Survey 5-year estimates. Retrieved June 30, 2021 from https://censusreporter.org/profiles/40000US41212-indianapolis-in-urbanized-area.

- For the **Disease Data in Marion County**, the citation is:
  > The New York Times. 2021. Coronavirus in the U.S.: Latest Map and Case Count. Retrieved from https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets in a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
