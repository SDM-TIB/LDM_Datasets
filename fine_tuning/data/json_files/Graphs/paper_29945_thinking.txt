To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Superficial White Matter Analysis: An Efficient Point-cloud-based Deep Learning Framework with Supervised Contrastive Learning for Consistent Tractography Parcellation across Populations and dMRI Acquisitions" by Tengfei Xue et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors trained their model on a "large-scale tractography dataset" and tested it on "six independently acquired datasets." This suggests that there are multiple datasets to extract.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Methodology)**, specifically **subsection 2.1 (dMRI datasets and tractography)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for training and testing. Here, they mention:

1. **Training Dataset**: A high-quality large-scale tractography dataset with 1 million labeled streamlines derived from an anatomically curated white matter tractography atlas. This atlas is provided by the O’Donnell Research Group and is available online. The authors reference the original source of this atlas, which is crucial for citation.

2. **Testing Datasets**: The authors list six independently acquired datasets used for experimental evaluation, including:
   - **HCP (Human Connectome Project)**: 100 subjects, healthy adults.
   - **dHCP (Developing Human Connectome Project)**: 40 subjects, neonates.
   - **ABCD (Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development)**: 50 subjects, children.
   - **CNP (Consortium for Neuropsychiatric Phenomics)**: 50 subjects, patients with psychiatric disorders.
   - **PPMI (Parkinson’s Progression Markers Initiative)**: 50 subjects, patients with Parkinson's disease.
   - **BTP (Brain Tumor Patient)**: 39 subjects, patients with brain tumors.

In the **results section**, the authors provide additional context about the datasets, including their demographics and imaging protocols, which can be useful for understanding the datasets' characteristics.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

  > Marek, K., et al. (2011). *The parkinson progression marker initiative (PPMI)*. Progress in Neurobiology, 95, 629-635.

- For the **BTP dataset**, the authors mention that the data was acquired at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, but a specific citation is not provided in the text.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
