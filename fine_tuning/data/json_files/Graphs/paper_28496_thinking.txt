To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Heterogeneous Temporal Graph Neural Network" by Yujie Fan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments on heterogeneous temporal graphs built from different real-world datasets. This indicates that datasets are likely discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors specifically mention two datasets: **OGBN-MAG** and **COVID-19**. I will note down the details provided about each dataset, including their characteristics and the context in which they were used.

In the **experiments section**, the authors describe how they constructed the HTGs from these datasets. For **OGBN-MAG**, they explain that it is an academic network with dynamically evolving heterogeneous structures, while the **COVID-19** dataset is an epidemiological network with constantly changing node features. I will extract the relevant statistics and descriptions for both datasets.

Now, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The paper cites the original sources for the datasets, which is crucial for proper attribution. 

1. **OGBN-MAG**: The citation is:
   > Hu, W., Fey, M., Zitnik, M., Dong, Y., Ren, H., Liu, B., Catasta, M., & Leskovec, J. (2020). Open graph benchmark: Datasets for machine learning on graphs. *arXiv preprint arXiv:2005.00687*.

2. **COVID-19**: The dataset is sourced from 1point3acres, which is a publicly available dataset for COVID-19 case reports. The citation is:
   > 1point3acres. COVID-19 Data. Retrieved from https://coronavirus.1point3acres.com/en.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, along with proper references for further exploration.
