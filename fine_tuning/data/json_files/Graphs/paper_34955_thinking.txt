To extract datasets from the research paper titled "NAMER: Non-Autoregressive Modeling for Handwritten Mathematical Expression Recognition" by Chenyu Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that experiments were conducted on the **CROHME 2014/2016/2019 and HME100K datasets**, indicating that these are the datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will look for specific details about these datasets in the **experiments section**. In section 4.1, the authors provide a detailed description of the datasets:

1. **CROHME Dataset**: This dataset is described as the most widely-used public dataset in the field of Handwritten Mathematical Expression Recognition (HMER). It contains 8,836 handwritten mathematical expressions (HMEs) in the training set and three testing sets (CROHME 2014, 2016, and 2019) with 986, 1,147, and 1,199 HMEs, respectively. The dataset is stored in InkML format, capturing the trajectory coordinates of handwritten strokes.

2. **HME100K Dataset**: This dataset consists of 74,502 images for training and 24,607 images for testing, with a total of 249 symbol classes. The images are sourced from tens of thousands of writers and are captured in real-world settings, showcasing variations in color, blur, and complex backgrounds.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For the **CROHME Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Mahdavi, M., Zanibbi, R., Mouchere, H., Viard-Gaudin, C., & Garain, U. (2019). *ICDAR 2019 CROHME+ TFD: Competition on Recognition of Handwritten Mathematical Expressions and Typeset Formula Detection*. In Proceedings of the 2019 International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition (ICDAR), pages 1533–1538. IEEE.

- For the **HME100K Dataset**, the citation is:

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all details are accurately represented for future reference or processing.
