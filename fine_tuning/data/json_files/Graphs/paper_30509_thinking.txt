To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Event-Centric Question Answering via Contrastive Learning and Invertible Event Transformation" by Junru Lu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of the **ESTER dataset** for experimental results, which indicates that this dataset is crucial for the research.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **introduction**. The authors reference the **ESTER dataset** (Han et al., 2021) as a resource for developing machine reading comprehension models focused on event-centric QA. This confirms that the ESTER dataset is a primary dataset used in their work.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide details about the **ESTER dataset**, including its size and the nature of the annotations. They mention that the dataset contains 6,000 human-annotated event-centric questions and provides event type labels for each question. This section solidifies the importance of the ESTER dataset in their experiments.

I will also check the **related work section** to see if any other datasets are mentioned. The authors reference the **TORQUE dataset** (Ning et al., 2020) as a related dataset for temporal ordering questions, but it is not used in their experiments. However, it is still relevant to note.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to gather the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. For the **ESTER dataset**, the citation is:
   > Rujun Han, I-Hung Hsu, Jiao Sun, Julia Baylon, Qiang Ning, Dan Roth, and Nanyun Peng. *ESTER: A machine reading comprehension dataset for reasoning about event semantic relations*. In Proceedings of the 2021 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 7543–7559, 2021.

2. For the **TORQUE dataset**, the citation is:
   > Qiang Ning, Hao Wu, Rujun Han, Nanyun Peng, Matt Gardner, and Dan Roth. *TORQUE: A reading comprehension dataset of temporal ordering questions*. In Proceedings of the 2020 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 1158–1172, 2020.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets in a clear format, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as they are critical for proper attribution and further research.

In conclusion, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that they are clearly articulated and ready for any required output format or further processing.
