To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning through structure: towards deep neuromorphic knowledge graph embeddings" by Victor Caceres Chian et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to gather initial insights about the datasets used. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their method on various datasets, which indicates that there are datasets to be found.

Next, I will focus on **section III (Experiments)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they explicitly list three datasets:

1. **FB15k-237**: This dataset is a subset of the FB15k knowledge graph, specifically designed to prevent leakage between training and test sets. It contains 14,541 entities, 237 relations, and 310,116 triples.

2. **UMLS**: The Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) is a biomedical knowledge graph that includes 135 entities, 49 relations, and 5,216 triples.

3. **Countries S1**: This dataset is designed to examine reasoning abilities in knowledge base completion tasks. It consists of 272 entities, 2 relations, and 1,158 triples.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. However, since these datasets are well-known and widely used in the research community, they may not have specific citations in the references. Instead, I will provide general descriptions based on their common usage:

- **FB15k-237**: This dataset is derived from the original FB15k dataset, which is commonly referenced in knowledge graph research. The original citation is:
  > Bordes, A., Usunier, N., Garcia-Duran, A., Weston, J., & Yakhnenko, O. (2013). Translating embeddings for modeling multi-relational data. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS).

- **UMLS**: The UMLS is a well-established resource in biomedical informatics, and its citation is:
  > Bodenreider, O. (2004). The Unified Medical Language System (UMLS): Integrating biomedical terminology. In Proceedings of the AMIA Symposium.

- **Countries S1**: This dataset is specifically designed for the experiments in this paper, and it may not have a formal citation. However, it is referenced in the context of the experiments conducted in this study.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations where applicable. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
