To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Sim2Real Object-Centric Keypoint Detection and Description" by Chengliang Zhong et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions a "sim2real contrastive learning mechanism" and "comprehensive experiments on image matching and 6D pose estimation," which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** to identify specific datasets used for evaluation. In this section, the authors mention two datasets:

1. **YCB-Video Dataset**: This dataset consists of 21 objects and 92 RGB-D video sequences with pose annotations. The authors specifically use 2,949 keyframes from 12 videos for their experiments.

2. **YCBInEOAT Dataset**: This dataset includes 9 video sequences, each featuring one manipulated object from the YCB-Video dataset. The authors selected 5 valid videos with a total of 1,112 keyframes for their evaluation.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **YCB-Video Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Xiang, Y., Schmidt, T., Narayanan, V., & Fox, D. (2018). PoseCNN: A Convolutional Neural Network for 6D Object Pose Estimation in Cluttered Scenes. In Robotics: Science and Systems (RSS).

- For the **YCBInEOAT Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Wen, B., Mitash, C., Ren, B., & Bekris, K. (2020). se(3)-TrackNet: Data-driven 6D Pose Tracking by Calibrating Image Residuals in Synthetic Domains. In IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS).

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described clearly and that the full citations are included for reference. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research.
