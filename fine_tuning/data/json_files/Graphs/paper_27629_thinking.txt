To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multimodal Clustering Networks for Self-supervised Learning from Unlabeled Videos" by Brian Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their approach on the **HowTo100M dataset** and other datasets for zero-shot retrieval capabilities. This indicates that there are multiple datasets involved.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (Section 4) to find detailed descriptions of the datasets used. In **Section 4.2**, the authors explicitly list the datasets:

1. **HowTo100M**: This dataset is described as containing 1.2 million instructional videos along with their corresponding audio and automatically generated speech transcriptions. This dataset is crucial for training their model.

2. **YouCook2**: This dataset consists of 3.5K cooking instruction video clips with human-annotated text descriptions. It is used for evaluating the model's performance in text-to-video retrieval tasks.

3. **MSR-VTT**: This dataset contains 200K human-annotated video clip-caption pairs on various topics, which is also used for evaluation.

4. **CrossTask**: This dataset includes 2.7K instructional videos with action steps and their order collected from wikiHow articles, used for temporal action localization tasks.

5. **Mining YouTube**: This dataset focuses on YouTube videos for five simple dishes, containing 250 cooking videos that are densely annotated.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

- For **HowTo100M**, the citation is:
  > Miech, A., Zhukov, D., Alayrac, J.-B., Tapaswi, M., Laptev, I., & Sivic, J. (2019). *HowTo100M: Learning a text-video embedding by watching hundred million narrated video clips*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2019.

- For **YouCook2**, the citation is:

- For **CrossTask**, the citation is:
  > Zhukov, D., Alayrac, J.-B., Gokberk Cinbis, R., Fouhey, D., Laptev, I., & Sivic, J. (2019). *Cross-task weakly supervised learning from instructional videos*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2019.

- For **Mining YouTube**, the citation is:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
