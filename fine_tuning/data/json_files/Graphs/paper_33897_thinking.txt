To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Efficient Action Counting with Dynamic Queries" by Zishi Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors evaluate their method on the **RepCountA** benchmark, which suggests that this is a dataset used in their experiments.

Next, I will look into **section 4.1 (Datasets and Metrics)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention two datasets:

1. **RepCountA Dataset**: This dataset is described as the largest and most challenging benchmark for the video temporal repetition counting (TRC) task, compiled from fitness videos on YouTube. It includes a wide range of fitness activities in various settings and is notable for its extensive video lengths and significant variations in action cycles.

2. **UCFRep Dataset**: This dataset is a subset of the UCF101 dataset, focusing on fitness and daily life videos. The authors specify that they do not use the training set but directly test their model on the test set to evaluate generalization.

In the same section, the authors provide the following citations for these datasets:

- For the **RepCountA Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Hu, H., Dong, S., Zhao, Y., Lian, D., Li, Z., Gao, S. (2022). *TransRAC: Encoding multi-scale temporal correlation with transformers for repetitive action counting*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 19013–19022.

- For the **UCFRep Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Li, X., Xu, H. (2024). *Repetitive action counting with motion feature learning*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision, pp. 6499–6508.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
