To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ELVIS: Empowering Locality of Vision Language Pre-training with Intra-modal Similarity" by Sumin Seo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their method on various datasets, which indicates that there are datasets to be identified.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of collecting annotated data for chest X-ray images and mention that they utilize the **MIMIC-CXR** dataset for pre-training their model. This is a significant dataset that I need to note.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** where the authors evaluate their model on several datasets. They specifically mention using the following datasets for evaluation:

1. **RSNA Pneumonia Detection Dataset**: This dataset consists of 26,684 frontal-view chest radiographs with bounding boxes indicating the location of pneumonia.

2. **COVID Rural Segmentation Dataset**: This dataset contains 221 frontal-view chest radiographs with segmentation annotations for detecting COVID-19.

3. **SIIM Pneumothorax Segmentation Dataset**: This dataset comprises 12,047 frontal-view chest radiographs and segmentation masks for localizing pneumothorax.

4. **MS-CXR Local Alignment Dataset**: A subset of the MIMIC-CXR dataset, curated for phrase grounding, which includes 1,162 image-sentence pairs of bounding boxes for various lesions.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset from the **References section** of the paper:

- For the **MIMIC-CXR dataset**, the citation is:
  > Johnson, A.E.W., Pollard, T.J., Greenbaum, N.R., Lungren, M.P., Deng, C.Y., Peng, Y., Lu, Z., Mark, R.G., Berkowitz, S.J., Horng, S. (2019). *MIMIC-CXR-JPG, a large publicly available database of labeled chest radiographs*. https://doi.org/10.48550/ARXIV.1901.07042.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
