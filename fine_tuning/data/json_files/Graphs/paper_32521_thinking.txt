To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Will More Expressive Graph Neural Networks do Better on Generative Tasks?" by Xiandong Zou et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the use of the **ZINC-250k dataset** for experiments, which indicates that this is a key dataset for the research.

Next, I will look into **section 4.1 (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the datasets used. Here, they explicitly mention:

1. **ZINC-250k**: This dataset is described as containing around 250,000 drug-like molecules, which are relevant for pharmaceutical applications. The paper states that all molecules are presented in a kekulised form with hydrogen removed, and it includes various atom and edge types.

2. **QM9**: This dataset is mentioned as a subset of GDB9, containing virtual molecules that are likely to be synthesizable but have not yet been made. It includes complex annulated ring systems.

The authors also refer to other datasets in the context of comparisons but do not provide detailed descriptions for them. However, the ZINC-250k dataset is clearly the primary dataset used for their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **ZINC-250k**, the citation is:
  > Teague Sterling and John J Irwin. *ZINC 15â€“ligand discovery for everyone*. In Journal of chemical information and modeling, 2015.

- For **QM9**, the citation is:
  > Raghunathan Ramakrishnan, Pavlo O Dral, Matthias Rupp, and O Anatole von Lilienfeld. *Quantum chemistry structures and properties of 134 kilo molecules*. In Scientific data, 2014.

With this information, I will summarize the datasets extracted from the paper, ensuring to include the full citations as required.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for clarity and future reference.
