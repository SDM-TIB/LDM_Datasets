To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Joint Debiased Representation and Image Clustering Learning with Self-Supervision" by Shunjie-Fabian Zheng et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors have developed a method that improves performance across multiple datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be discussed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly where the authors describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, they mention using several datasets for both balanced and imbalanced settings. Specifically, they list:

1. **CIFAR-10**: A well-known dataset containing 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class.
2. **CIFAR-100**: Similar to CIFAR-10 but with 100 classes containing 600 images each.
3. **Glaucoma-1**: A labeled subset of human retinal images composed of 2,397 samples, with 956 diagnosed with glaucoma and 1,421 without.
4. **Glaucoma-2**: Contains retinal microscopic images in two classes (healthy and glaucoma) with an imbalanced ratio of 1:9.
5. **ISIC-2018**: A dataset released at MICCAI 2018 containing 7 different skin lesions with varying imbalance ratios.

I will also check the **references section** to find full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for the datasets used in the research.

For the datasets mentioned, I will compile the following citations:

- **CIFAR-10**:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton, and et al. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. 2009.

- **CIFAR-100**:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton, and et al. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. 2009.

- **Glaucoma-1**:
  > Andres Diaz-Pinto, Adrián Colomer, Valery Naranjo, Sandra Morales, Yanwu Xu, and Alejandro F Frangi. *Retinal image synthesis and semi-supervised learning for glaucoma assessment*. IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging, 38(9):2211–2218, 2019.

- **Glaucoma-2**:
  > José Ignacio Orlando, Huazhu Fu, João Barbosa Breda, Karel van Keer, Deepti R Bathula, et al. *Refuge challenge: A unified framework for evaluating automated methods for glaucoma assessment from fundus photographs*. Medical Image Analysis, 59:101570, 2020.

- **ISIC-2018**:
  > The International Skin Imaging Collaboration. *ISIC 2018: Skin Lesion Analysis Towards Melanoma Detection*. 2018.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets and their citations in a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly identified along with its full citation for future reference.
