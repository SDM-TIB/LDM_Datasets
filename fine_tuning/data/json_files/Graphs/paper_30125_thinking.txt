To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Scenario-Adaptive and Self-Supervised Model for Multi-Scenario Personalized Recommendation" by Yuanliang Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the model was evaluated on "public and industrial datasets," which indicates that there are datasets used in the experiments that I need to identify.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors provide details about the datasets used. In this section, they explicitly mention three datasets:

1. **Ali-MSSV**: This is described as an industrial Multi-Scenario Short Video dataset from Taobao, with data collected from March 24, 2022, to April 4, 2022, for training, and April 5, 2022, for testing. The dataset includes two dense scenarios and two spare scenarios.

2. **Ali-CCP**: This is a public dataset released by Taobao, which has prepared training and testing sets. The authors split this dataset into three scenarios for their experiments.

3. **Ali-Mama**: This is another public dataset released by Alimama, with data collected from May 6, 2017, to May 11, 2017, for training, and testing conducted on May 11, 2022. The dataset is arranged into five scenarios based on city levels.

I will now check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

- For **Ali-MSSV**, the citation is not explicitly provided in the references, as it is an industrial dataset. However, I will note that it is an internal dataset from Taobao.

- For **Ali-CCP**, the citation is:
  > Taobao. *Ali-CCP Dataset*. Available at: [URL or DOI if available].

- For **Ali-Mama**, the citation is:
  > Alimama. *Ali-Mama Dataset*. Available at: [URL or DOI if available].

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and includes its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, which is essential for reproducibility and further research.
