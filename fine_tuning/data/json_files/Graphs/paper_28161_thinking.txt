To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Graph-to-3D: End-to-End Generation and Manipulation of 3D Scenes Using Scene Graphs" by Helisa Dhamo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to gather initial insights about the datasets used. The abstract mentions the use of **3DSSG** and **3RScan**, which indicates that these are likely datasets relevant to the research.

Next, I will focus on the **data preparation section** (section 3), where the authors describe their approach to dataset preparation. Here, they explicitly mention that their method is built on top of **3DSSG**, which is a large-scale dataset based on **3RScan**. This section provides crucial details about the datasets, including their purpose and characteristics.

In the **results section**, the authors evaluate their method using the **3DSSG dataset**. They mention that it contains semantic scene graphs, which further confirms its relevance. Additionally, they reference **3RScan** as a foundational dataset for their work, indicating that it is essential for the training and evaluation of their model.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are critical for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

1. For **3DSSG**, the citation is:
   > Wald, J., Dhamo, H., Navab, N., & Tombari, F. (2020). Learning 3D Semantic Scene Graphs from 3D Indoor Reconstructions. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2020.

2. For **3RScan**, the citation is:
   > Wald, J., Avetisyan, A., Navab, N., Tombari, F., & Nie√üner, M. (2019). RIO: 3D Object Instance Re-Localization in Changing Indoor Environments. In International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2019.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited. This will facilitate further research and provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the study.
