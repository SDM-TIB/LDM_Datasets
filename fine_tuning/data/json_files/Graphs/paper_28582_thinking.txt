To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Pre-training Graph Neural Network for Cross Domain Recommendation" by Chen Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the use of datasets from the Amazon Review Data (2018), specifically referring to "Grocery and Gourmet Food" and "Prime Pantry." This indicates that these datasets are likely important for the experiments conducted in the paper.

Next, I will look at the **experiments section** where the authors provide details about the datasets used. In this case, I find a table (Table I) that summarizes the statistics of the datasets, confirming that "Amazon-GGF" is the source domain and "Amazon-PP" is the target domain. The table provides the number of users and item sparsity for both datasets, which is crucial information for understanding their characteristics.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. Since the datasets are derived from the Amazon Review Data, I will look for the appropriate citation that corresponds to this dataset collection. The citation for the Amazon Review Data is:

> Jianmo Ni, Julian McAuley, and J. Leskovec. *RecBole: Towards a Unified, Comprehensive Framework for Recommendation Systems*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1906.04864, 2019.

With this information, I can summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **Amazon-GGF**: This dataset is used as the source domain in the experiments. It contains 31,230 users and has an item sparsity of 99.96%.

2. **Amazon-PP**: This dataset serves as the target domain. It includes 14,180 users and has an item sparsity of 99.80%.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This structured approach will help in accurately documenting the datasets used in the research paper.
