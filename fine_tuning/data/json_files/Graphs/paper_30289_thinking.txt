To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Self-supervised Denoising via Low-rank Tensor Approximated Convolutional Neural Network" by Chenyin Gao et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world noisy images, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4) where the authors detail their methodology. In this section, they mention conducting experiments on various datasets, including:

1. **SET12 Dataset**: This dataset is referenced multiple times in the context of evaluating the proposed denoising method against various noise levels. It is a well-known benchmark for image denoising.

2. **BSD68 Dataset**: This dataset is also mentioned in the context of out-sample performance evaluation, indicating that the authors tested their method on this dataset as well.

In addition to these datasets, the authors refer to a **real-world dataset of the SARS-CoV-2 2P protein** produced by cryo-electron microscopy, which is used to demonstrate the effectiveness of their method on real-world noisy images.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **SET12 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Zhang, K., Zuo, W., Chen, Y., Meng, D., & Zhang, L. (2017). Beyond a Gaussian denoiser: Residual learning of deep CNN for image denoising. *IEEE Transactions on Image Processing*, 26(7), 3142-3155.

- For the **BSD68 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Martin, D., Fowlkes, C., Tal, D., & Malik, J. (2001). A database of human segmented natural images and its application to evaluating segmentation algorithms and measuring ecological statistics. In *Proceedings of the 8th International Conference on Computer Vision* (Vol. 2, pp. 416-423).

- For the **SARS-CoV-2 2P protein dataset**, the citation is:
  > Bepler, T., Kelley, K., Noble, A. J., & Berger, B. (2020). Topaz-denoise: General deep denoising models for cryo-EM and cryo-ET. *Nature Communications*, 11(1), 1-12.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
