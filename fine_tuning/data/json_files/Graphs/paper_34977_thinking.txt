To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Graph Neural Networks and Spatial Information Learning for Post-Processing Ensemble Weather Forecasts" by Moritz Feik et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant details, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and data sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of a graph neural network architecture for ensemble post-processing, which suggests that datasets are involved in the evaluation of the proposed method.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Data)**, where the authors explicitly describe the dataset used for their experiments. Here, they mention the **EUPPBench** dataset, which is a benchmark dataset for ensemble post-processing. The authors provide details about the dataset, including its coverage of medium-range ensemble forecasts from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) and corresponding station observations from 1997 to 2018.

The paper states that the EUPPBench dataset includes:
- 4180 reforecasts with 11 ensemble members from 1997 to 2017.
- 730 daily operational forecasts from 2017–2018 with 51 ensemble members.
- A total of 31 predictor variables available for analysis.

The authors also refer to the dataset's structure and the specific tasks they focus on, namely "reforecast to reforecast" (R2R) and "reforecast to forecast" (R2F).

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the EUPPBench dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:
> Demaeyer, J., Bhend, J., Lerch, S., Primo, C., Van Schaeybroeck, B., Atencia, A., Ben Bouall`egue, Z., Chen, J., Dabernig, M., Evans, G., Faganeli Pucer, J., Hooper, B., Horat, N., Jobst, D., Merˇse, J., Mlakar, P., M¨oller, A., Mestre, O., Taillardat, M., and Vannitsem, S. The EUPP-Bench postprocessing benchmark dataset v1.0. *Earth System Science Data*, 15(6):2635–2653, 2023.

With this information, I can summarize the dataset as follows:

1. **EUPPBench Dataset**: A benchmark dataset for ensemble post-processing that includes medium-range ensemble forecasts and corresponding station observations over an extended period. It spans from 1997 to 2018 and includes 122 weather stations in Europe.

Now, I will compile the dataset entry with the full citation into a structured format for further processing. This ensures that I have accurately captured the necessary details and citations for the dataset used in the research paper.
