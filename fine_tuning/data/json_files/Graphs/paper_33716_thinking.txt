To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Investigating Reproducibility in Deep Learning-Based Software Fault Prediction" by Dietmar Jannach, Adil Mukhtar, and Franz Wotawa, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the analysis of reproducibility in software fault prediction, which may imply the use of datasets, but I need to find specific mentions.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly where the authors describe their systematic review process. They mention reviewing 56 research articles published between 2019 and 2022, which likely utilized various datasets for their experiments. I will look for any specific datasets referenced in this context.

In the **results section**, I will check for any explicit mentions of datasets used in the reviewed articles. The authors may summarize the datasets utilized across the studies they analyzed, which would be crucial for my extraction.

I will also examine the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. If the authors refer to specific datasets used in the articles they reviewed, I will need to ensure I capture the original sources for those datasets.

After identifying the datasets, I will compile the necessary details, including the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations. If the paper mentions any public datasets, I will ensure to note their accessibility and any preprocessing steps discussed.

Finally, I will organize the extracted information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited, ready for further processing or review.
