To extract datasets from the research paper titled "To Answer or Not to Answer? Improving Machine Reading Comprehension Model with Span-based Contrastive Learning" by Yunjie Ji et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that experiments were conducted on the **SQuAD 2.0 dataset**, which indicates that this dataset is central to the research.

Next, I will look into **section 4.1 (Datasets and Metrics)**, where the authors explicitly mention the **SQuAD 2.0 dataset**. They describe it as covering questions from SQuAD 1.1 with additional unanswerable questions created by crowdworkers. The training dataset consists of 87,000 answerable and 43,000 unanswerable questions, which provides a clear understanding of the dataset's structure and purpose.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the SQuAD 2.0 dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Pranav Rajpurkar, Robin Jia, and Percy Liang. *Know what you donâ€™t know: Unanswerable questions for SQuAD*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1806.03822, 2018.

Since the paper primarily focuses on the SQuAD 2.0 dataset, I will compile this information into a structured format that highlights the dataset's name, description, and citation.

After gathering all necessary details, I will ensure that the dataset entry is complete and ready for further processing or review.
