To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Efficient, high-performance semantic segmentation using multi-scale feature extraction" by Moritz Knolle et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors present a segmentation algorithm tested on a clinical task, which suggests that datasets are involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of accessing large datasets in medical applications and mention the need for diverse data sources. However, I need to look for specific dataset names.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly the subsection titled "Training, validation and independent testing datasets." Here, the authors explicitly mention using the **pancreas dataset from the Medical Segmentation Decathlon (MSD)** for training and validation. They describe the dataset's composition, including the number of abdominal CT scans used for training and validation splits.

Additionally, they mention an **independent clinical PDAC dataset** for out-of-sample validation, consisting of 85 abdominal CT scans. This dataset is crucial for assessing the generalization performance of their model.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **Medical Segmentation Decathlon (MSD)** dataset, the citation is:
   > Simpson AL, Antonelli M, Bakas S, Bilello M, Farahani K, Van Ginneken B, et al. *A large annotated medical image dataset for the development and evaluation of segmentation algorithms*. arXiv preprint arXiv:190209063. 2019.

2. The **clinical PDAC dataset** is not explicitly cited in the references, as it consists of confidential patient information collected at the authors' institution. Therefore, I will note that while the dataset is mentioned, it does not have a publicly available citation.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

- **Pancreas Dataset from MSD**: Used for training and validation, consisting of 196 abdominal CT scans for training and 85 for validation.
- **Independent Clinical PDAC Dataset**: Used for out-of-sample validation, consisting of 85 abdominal CT scans, but no citation is available due to confidentiality.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
