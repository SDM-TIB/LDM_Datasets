To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Pre-training of Graph Neural Network for Modeling Effects of Mutations on Protein-Protein Binding Affinity" by Xianggen Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their method on **five benchmark datasets**, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **results section**, where the authors discuss the performance of their method on various datasets. They mention three specific datasets used for evaluation:

1. **AB-Bind Dataset**: This dataset consists of 1,101 mutational data points derived from studies of 32 antibody-antigen complexes, which include both single- and multi-point mutations.

2. **SKEMPI Dataset**: This dataset contains 3,047 binding free energy changes upon mutation, assembled from the scientific literature for protein-protein heterodimeric complexes.

3. **SKEMPI 2.0 Dataset**: An updated version of the SKEMPI dataset, which includes 7,085 single- or multi-point mutations from 345 complexes.

In the **methods section**, the authors provide additional context about how these datasets were utilized in their experiments, confirming their relevance and importance for the study.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **AB-Bind Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Sirin, S., Apgar, J. R., Bennett, E. M., & Keating, A. E. (2016). AB-Bind: Antibody binding mutational database for computational affinity predictions. *Protein Science*, 25(2), 393-409.

- For the **SKEMPI Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Moal, I. H., & Fernández-Recio, J. (2012). SKEMPI: A structural kinetic and energetic database of mutant protein interactions and its use in empirical models. *Bioinformatics*, 28(20), 2600-2607.

- For the **SKEMPI 2.0 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Jankauskaitė, J., Jiménez-García, B., Dapkūnas, J., Fernández-Recio, J., & Moal, I. H. (2019). SKEMPI 2.0: An updated benchmark of changes in protein–protein binding energy, kinetics and thermodynamics upon mutation. *Bioinformatics*, 35(3), 462-469.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the study, which is crucial for understanding the context and implications of the research findings.
