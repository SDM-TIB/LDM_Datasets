To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Supervised Contrastive Learning of Transient Stability for Changing Power Grid Topologies" by Zijian Lv et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the use of the IEEE 39-bus system model for generating power grids of varying topologies, which indicates that this model is likely a dataset of interest. The introduction further emphasizes the importance of transient stability assessment and mentions the use of simulations to generate transient operational data.

Next, I will look into **section IV (Transient Stability Prediction and Alternating Grid Topology)**, where the authors describe the datasets generated for their experiments. Here, they specifically mention:

1. **Topology Change Dataset**: This dataset is derived from the IEEE 39-bus system, which includes various topological alterations. The authors explain how they modified the topology by removing and adding edges to create different scenarios.

2. **PMU Data**: This dataset includes transient operational data obtained through simulations of the power system under different fault conditions, specifically focusing on the N-1 criterion for stability.

The authors also mention that a total of **317,679 datasets** were generated, which is significant for understanding the scale of their experiments.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The IEEE 39-bus system is a well-known benchmark in power systems, and I will ensure to cite it correctly. The citation for the IEEE 39-bus system is typically referenced in literature as follows:

- For the IEEE 39-bus system, the citation is:
  > "IEEE 39-Bus System." IEEE Power System Test Case Archive. [Online]. Available: http://www.ee.washington.edu/research/pstca/

Additionally, I will note that the PMU data is generated through simulations using the Power System Toolbox (PST) in Matlab, which may not have a specific citation but can be referenced as follows:

- For the Power System Toolbox (PST), the citation is:
  > Chow, J., & Cheung, K. (1992). "A toolbox for power system dynamics and control engineering education and research." *IEEE Transactions on Power Systems*, 7(4), 1559-1564.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and includes the full citation as required. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any critical details or citations related to the datasets used in the research.
