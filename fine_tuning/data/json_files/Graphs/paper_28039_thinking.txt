To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Relational Graph Convolutional Networks: A Closer Look" by Thiviyan Thanapalasingam et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract states that the authors validate their implementations using benchmark Knowledge Graph datasets for node classification and link prediction tasks. This indicates that datasets are indeed involved.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments** section, particularly in **section 5 (Downstream Task: Node Classification)** and **section 6 (Downstream Task: Link Prediction)**. In section 5.3.1, the authors list the datasets used for node classification:

1. **AIFB**: Described as a dataset that represents a research institute in terms of its staff, research groups, and publications.
2. **MUTAG**: Derived as an example dataset for machine learning models about complex molecules.
3. **BGS**: Contains information about geological measurements in Great Britain.
4. **AM**: Contains information about artifacts in the Amsterdam Museum.

In section 6.2.1, the authors mention the datasets used for link prediction:

1. **WN18**: A subset of WordNet that describes lexical relations between words.
2. **FB-Toy**: A dataset consisting of a subset of FB15k.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **AIFB**, the citation is:
  > Stephan Bloehdorn and York Sure. *Kernel methods for mining instance data in ontologies*. In The Semantic Web, Springer, 2007, pp. 58–71.

- For **MUTAG**, the citation is:
  > Asim Kumar Debnath, Rosa L Lopez de Compadre, Gargi Debnath, Alan J Shusterman, and Corwin Hansch. *Structure-activity relationship of mutagenic aromatic and heteroaromatic nitro compounds*. Journal of medicinal chemistry, 1991, 34(2):786–797.

- For **BGS**, the citation is:
  > Gerben KD de Vries. *A fast approximation of the weisfeiler-lehman graph kernel for rdf data*. In Joint European Conference on Machine Learning and Knowledge Discovery in Databases, Springer, 2013, pp. 606–621.

- For **AM**, the citation is:
  > Victor De Boer, Jan Wielemaker, Judith Van Gent, Michiel Hildebrand, Antoine Isaac, Jacco Van Ossenbruggen, and Guus Schreiber. *Supporting linked data production for cultural heritage institutes: the amsterdam museum case study*. In Extended Semantic Web Conference, Springer, 2012, pp. 733–747.

- For **WN18**, the citation is:
  > Antoine Bordes, Nicolas Usunier, Alberto Garcia-Duran, Jason Weston, and Oksana Yakhnenko. *Translating embeddings for modeling multi-relational data*. Advances in neural information processing systems, 2013, pp. 2787–2795.

- For **FB-Toy**, the citation is:
  > Daniel Ruffinelli, Samuel Broscheit, and Rainer Gemulla. *You can teach an old dog new tricks! on training knowledge graph embeddings*. International Conference on Learning Representations, 2019.

With this information gathered, I will now compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and cited according to the requirements.
