To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Are large multimodal models emotionally aware?" by Katherine Deng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the datasets discussed. The abstract mentions the creation of the **Socratis benchmark**, which is a societal reactions benchmark containing annotated emotions and reactions for image-caption pairs. This indicates that there is a dataset involved.

Next, I will focus on the **section 2 (Socratis Dataset)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset. Here, they describe the dataset as containing **18,378 annotated reactions for 980 emotions on 2,075 image-caption pairs** collected from five existing news and image-caption datasets. This section is crucial as it outlines the specifics of the dataset, including its purpose and the methodology used for data collection.

In the **data annotation subsection**, the authors mention that the image-caption pairs were collected from the **Visual News** and **Conceptual Captions** datasets. This is important as it identifies the sources of the data used in the Socratis benchmark.

Now, I will look for the full citations of the datasets mentioned in the **References section** of the paper. The relevant citations are:

1. **Visual News Dataset**:
   > Liu, F., Wang, Y., Wang, T., & Ordonez, V. (2020). Visual news: Benchmark and challenges in news image captioning. *arXiv preprint arXiv:2010.03743*.

2. **Conceptual Captions Dataset**:
   > Sharma, P., Ding, N., Goodman, S., & Soricut, R. (2018). Conceptual captions: A cleaned, hypernymed, image alt-text dataset for automatic image captioning. In Proceedings of the 56th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers), pages 2556â€“2565.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
