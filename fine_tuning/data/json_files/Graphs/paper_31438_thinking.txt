To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Weakly-Supervised Text Instance Segmentation" by Xinyan Zu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their method on specific benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved. 

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention several datasets:

1. **ICDAR2013-FST**: This dataset is referenced as a benchmark for text segmentation, and the authors report a significant improvement in performance when using it.

2. **TextSeg**: Another dataset mentioned that is used for evaluating their method, which also shows a notable performance enhancement.

3. **Total-Text**: This dataset is included in the joint training stage, indicating its relevance to the experiments conducted.

4. **MLT S**: This dataset is also mentioned as part of the training process.

5. **COCO TS**: This dataset is included as well, further contributing to the training and evaluation of the proposed method.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets.

The full citations I will extract are:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured all relevant details from the paper regarding the datasets used in the research.
