To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Contrastive Neural Text Generation" by Chenxin An et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors validate their method on **five generation tasks with ten benchmarks**, which suggests that multiple datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names and descriptions.

In **Section 4.1 (Baselines)**, the authors mention various benchmarks, but I need to find the specific datasets. As I continue through the paper, I will pay close attention to any tables or figures that summarize the datasets used in their experiments.

Upon reaching **Section 4.2 (Quantitative Results)**, I will find detailed results for specific tasks, which often include the names of the datasets. The authors mention datasets such as **WMT’16 Ro-En**, **IWSLT’14 De-En**, **XSum**, **Multi-News**, **WikiBio**, **Totto**, and **CommonGen**. I will note these down as they are likely the datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper documentation. For example, I will look for the original papers or sources that describe each dataset in detail.

Here are the datasets I have identified so far:

1. **WMT’16 Ro-En**: A dataset for Romanian-to-English translation.
   - Citation: 
     > Bojar, O., et al. (2016). *Findings of the 2016 Conference on Machine Translation (WMT16)*. 

2. **IWSLT’14 De-En**: A dataset for German-to-English translation.
   - Citation: 
     > Cettolo, M., et al. (2014). *The IWSLT 2014 Evaluation Campaign*. 

3. **XSum**: A dataset for extreme summarization of BBC news articles.
   - Citation: 
     > Narayan, S., et al. (2018). *Don’t Give Me the Details, Just the Summary! Topic-Aware Convolutional Neural Networks for Extreme Summarization*. 

4. **Multi-News**: A dataset for multi-document summarization.
   - Citation: 
     > Fabbri, A. R., et al. (2019). *Multi-News: A Large-Scale Multi-Document Summarization Dataset and Abstractive Hierarchical Model*. 

5. **WikiBio**: A dataset for biography generation from structured data.
   - Citation: 
     > Lebret, R., et al. (2016). *Neural Text Generation from Structured Data with Application to the Biography Domain*. 

6. **Totto**: A dataset for table-to-text generation.
   - Citation: 
     > Parikh, A., et al. (2020). *Totto: A Controlled Table-to-Text Generation Dataset*. 

7. **CommonGen**: A dataset for commonsense generation.
   - Citation: 
     > Lin, B. Y., et al. (2020). *CommonGen: A Constrained Text Generation Challenge for Generative Commonsense Reasoning*. 

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I accurately capture all relevant datasets and their sources from the paper.
