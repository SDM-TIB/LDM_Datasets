To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Mitigating the Impact of False Negatives in Dense Retrieval with Contrastive Confidence Regularization" by Shiqi Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on three datasets, which indicates that I should find their names and details.

Next, I will focus on **section 6 (Experiment)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention:

1. **Natural Questions (NQ)**: This dataset is referenced as a benchmark for question answering research. It is important to note its significance in the context of the experiments.

2. **Trivia QA (TQ)**: Another dataset mentioned, which is also used for evaluating question answering systems.

3. **MSMARCO Passage Ranking (MS-pas)**: This dataset is highlighted as a third dataset used in their experiments, specifically for passage ranking tasks.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access these datasets.

The full citations I will extract are:

- For **Natural Questions (NQ)**:
  > Kwiatkowski, T., Palomaki, J., Redfield, O., Collins, M., Parikh, A., Alberti, C., Epstein, D., Polosukhin, I., Devlin, J., Lee, K., et al. (2019). *Natural Questions: A Benchmark for Question Answering Research*. Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics.

- For **Trivia QA (TQ)**:
  > Joshi, M., Choi, E., Weld, D. S., & Zettlemoyer, L. (2017). *TriviaQA: A Large Scale Distantly Supervised Challenge Dataset for Reading Comprehension*. In Proceedings of the 55th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics.

- For **MSMARCO Passage Ranking (MS-pas)**:
  > Nguyen, T., Rosenberg, M., Song, X., Gao, J., Tiwary, S., Majumder, R., & Deng, L. (2016). *MS MARCO: A Human Generated MAchine Reading COmprehension Dataset*. In Proceedings of the 2016 Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This systematic approach ensures that I capture all relevant details while maintaining proper attribution to the original sources.
