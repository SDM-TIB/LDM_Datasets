To extract datasets from the research paper titled "COLO: A Contrastive Learning based Re-ranking Framework for One-Stage Summarization" by Chenxin An et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on five mainstream datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention:

1. **CNN/DailyMail**: A classic benchmark dataset containing articles from CNN and Daily Mail newspapers. The authors specify that they used the cased version from the datasets.

2. **XSum**: A one-sentence summary dataset from BBC News, where the gold summaries are professionally written by the authors of the documents.

3. **Reddit**: This dataset is collected from the social media platform Reddit, specifically using the TIFU-long version.

4. **PubMed**: A long document summarization dataset from the scientific domain, noted for having an average summary length about four times longer than typical summaries.

5. **SSN**: This dataset consists of papers mainly from math, physics, and computer science, with the abstract section serving as the gold reference.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **CNN/DailyMail**, the citation is:
  > Karl Moritz Hermann, Tomas Kocisky, Edward Grefenstette, Lasse Espeholt, Will Kay, Mustafa Suleyman, and Phil Blunsom. *Teaching machines to read and comprehend*. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, pages 1684–1692, 2015.

- For **XSum**, the citation is:
  > Shashi Narayan, Shay B Cohen, and Mirella Lapata. *Don’t give me the details, just the summary! Topic-aware convolutional neural networks for extreme summarization*. In Proceedings of the 2018 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 1797–1807, 2018.

- For **Reddit**, the citation is:
  > Byeongchang Kim, Hyunwoo Kim, and Gunhee Kim. *Abstractive summarization of reddit posts with multi-level memory networks*. In Proceedings of the 2019 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, pages 2519–2531, 2019.

- For **PubMed**, the citation is:
  > Arman Cohan, Franck Dernoncourt, Doo Soon Kim, Trung Bui, Seokhwan Kim, Walter Chang, and Nazli Goharian. *A discourse-aware attention model for abstractive summarization of long documents*. In Proceedings of the 2018 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, pages 615–621, 2018.

- For **SSN**, the citation is:
  > Chenxin An, Ming Zhong, Yiran Chen, Danqing Wang, Xipeng Qiu, and Xuanjing Huang. *Enhancing scientific papers summarization with citation graph*. In Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, volume 35, pages 12498–12506, 2021.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will allow for a clear and organized presentation of the datasets used in the research.
