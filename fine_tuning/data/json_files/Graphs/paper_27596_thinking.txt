To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Higher-Order Attribute-Enhancing Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks" by Jianxin Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on three datasets, which indicates that I should look for specific names and details of these datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section (Section 5)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention three datasets:

1. **DBLP Dataset**: This dataset is described as a subset containing 27,194 nodes, including authors, papers, conferences, and terms, with 122,393 edges. The authors label the nodes by their research areas, which include four classes: Database, Data Mining, AI, and Information Retrieval.

2. **IMDB Dataset**: The authors describe this dataset as a subset containing 9,692 nodes, including movies, actors, directors, and rating groups, with 18,132 edges. The movies are labeled by their genres, which include Action, Comedy, and Drama.

3. **HUAWEI Dataset**: This dataset is provided by DIGIX Huawei Global Smartphone Theme Design Competition and contains 10,371 nodes, including users, applications, and application types, with 248,479 edges. Users are labeled according to their age groups, which include six groups.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and should be formatted correctly.

- For the **DBLP Dataset**, the citation is:
  > H. Zhao, Q. Yao, J. Li, Y. Song, and D. L. Lee. "Meta-graph based recommendation fusion over heterogeneous information networks." In Proceedings of the SIGKDD. ACM, 2017, pp. 635–644.

- For the **IMDB Dataset**, the citation is:
  > A. Grover and J. Leskovec. "node2vec: Scalable feature learning for networks." In Proceedings of the SIGKDD. ACM, 2016, pp. 855–864.

- For the **HUAWEI Dataset**, the citation is:
  > H. Peng, J. Li, Y. Song, R. Yang, R. Rajiv, Y. Philip S., and H. Lifang. "Streaming social event detection and evolution discovery in heterogeneous information networks." ACM Transactions on Knowledge Discovery from Data, 2021.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset along with its citation. This will ensure that the datasets are accurately represented and properly attributed in any subsequent analysis or reporting.
