To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MARIO: Model Agnostic Recipe for Improving OOD Generalization of Graph Contrastive Learning" by Yun Zhu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that the authors demonstrate their method's effectiveness on various datasets, which indicates that datasets are likely discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention several datasets, including:

1. **GOOD-Cora**: A citation network dataset derived from the Cora dataset, used for multi-class classification tasks with 70 classes.
2. **GOOD-Twitch**: A gamer network dataset where nodes represent gamers and edges represent friendships, used for binary classification tasks.
3. **GOOD-CBAS**: A synthetic dataset based on the BA-Shapes dataset, used for predicting node roles in a graph.
4. **GOOD-WebKB**: A dataset of university webpages used for multi-class classification tasks.
5. **Amazon-Photo**: A co-purchasing network dataset used for evaluating GNN models.
6. **Elliptic**: A financial network dataset that records Bitcoin transactions over time.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, the citation for **GOOD-Cora** is:
> S. Gui, X. Li, L. Wang, and S. Ji. "GOOD: A Graph Out-of-Distribution Benchmark." In Proceedings of the Thirty-Sixth Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems, 2022.

Similarly, I will find citations for the other datasets mentioned.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant datasets and their details from the paper.
