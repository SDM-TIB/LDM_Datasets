To extract datasets from the research paper titled "dynnode2vec: Scalable Dynamic Network Embedding" by Sedigheh Mahdavi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, while the introduction often outlines the motivation and context, which may include references to datasets. The experiments section is crucial as it typically details the datasets used for evaluation.

In the **experiments section**, I will look for a subsection specifically dedicated to datasets. Here, the authors mention several datasets used to evaluate the performance of dynnode2vec. I will list each dataset along with its description:

1. **Hep-th**: This dataset is described as a co-authorship network of researchers in high energy physics theory conferences, consisting of 34,000 nodes and 421,000 edges divided into 60 graphs.

2. **Autonomous Systems (AS)**: This dataset is built from logs of the BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) and includes 6,000 nodes, 13,000 edges, and 100 time steps.

3. **Enron**: The Enron dataset represents email communications among Enron company employees, containing 87,000 nodes and 1.1 million edges over 175 months.

4. **StackOverflow (St-Ov)**: Derived from interactions on the Math Overflow website, this dataset includes 14,000 nodes and 195,000 edges over 2,350 days, divided into 58 graphs.

5. **dblp**: This co-authorship network dataset consists of 90,000 nodes and 749,000 edges over 18 years, with nodes labeled according to their research fields.

6. **Darpa**: This dataset consists of communications between source and destination IPs, including various attacks, with a subset containing 12,000 nodes and 22,000 edges over 100 hours.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are essential for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. Here are the citations I will extract:

- For **Hep-th**, the citation is:
  > Johannes Gehrke, Paul Ginsparg, and Jon Kleinberg. Overview of the 2003 KDD Cup. ACM SIGKDD Explorations Newsletter, 5(2):149-151, 2003.

- For **Autonomous Systems (AS)**, the citation is:
  > Jure Leskovec and Andrej Krevl. SNAP Datasets: Stanford Large Network Dataset Collection, 2014.

- For **Enron**, the citation is:
  > Enron Network Dataset, http://konect.uni-koblenz.de/networks/.

- For **StackOverflow (St-Ov)**, the citation is:
  > Math Overflow Network Dataset, http://snap.stanford.edu/data/sx-mathoverflow.html/.

- For **dblp**, the citation is:
  > Jie Tang, Jing Zhang, Limin Yao, Juanzi Li, Li Zhang, and Zhong Su. ArnetMiner: Extraction and Mining of Academic Social Networks. In Proceedings of the Fourteenth ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (SIGKDDâ€™2008).

- For **Darpa**, the citation is:

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, ready for further processing or review.
