To extract datasets from the research paper titled "TorusE: Knowledge Graph Embedding on a Lie Group" by Takuma Ebisu and Ryutaro Ichise, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses knowledge graphs and mentions the development of the TorusE model, but it does not specify datasets. The introduction provides context about knowledge graphs but does not name any datasets either.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe their experimental setup. Here, they explicitly mention two benchmark datasets used for evaluation: **WN18** and **FB15K**. I will take note of the details provided about these datasets, including their statistics, which are summarized in Table 2.

The paper states the following about the datasets:

1. **WN18**: 
   - Number of Entities: 40,943
   - Number of Relations: 18
   - Number of Training Triples: 141,442
   - Number of Validation Triples: 5,000
   - Number of Test Triples: 5,000

2. **FB15K**: 
   - Number of Entities: 14,951
   - Number of Relations: 1,345
   - Number of Training Triples: 483,142
   - Number of Validation Triples: 50,000
   - Number of Test Triples: 59,071

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **WN18**, the citation is:
  > Miller, G. A. (1995). Wordnet: A lexical database for English. *Communications of the ACM*, 38(11), 39-41.

- For **FB15K**, the citation is:
  > Bollacker, K., Evans, C., Paritosh, P., Sturge, T., & Taylor, J. (2008). Freebase: A collaboratively created graph database for structuring human knowledge. In *Proceedings of the 2008 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data* (pp. 1247-1250).

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and structured summary of the datasets used in the research.
