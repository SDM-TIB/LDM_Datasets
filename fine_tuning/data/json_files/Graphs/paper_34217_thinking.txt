To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MyGO: Discrete Modality Information as Fine-Grained Tokens for Multi-modal Knowledge Graph Completion" by Yichi Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on "public MMKG benchmarks," which suggests that datasets are involved. I will look for specific names of these datasets.

Next, I will navigate to the **experiments section** (Section 5) where the authors discuss their experimental setup. In **Section 5.1.1 (Datasets)**, the authors explicitly mention two datasets used for evaluation: **DB15K** and **MKG-W**. I will take note of the details provided about these datasets, including their characteristics and the context in which they were used.

The paper provides a **Table 1** that summarizes statistical information about the datasets, including the number of entities, relations, and the number of training, validation, and test samples. This information is crucial for understanding the datasets' scope and scale.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are essential for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. 

For **DB15K**, the citation is:
> Ye Liu, Hui Li, Alberto García-Durán, Mathias Niepert, Daniel Oñoro-Rubio, and David S. Rosenblum. *MMKG: Multi-modal Knowledge Graphs*. In ESWC (Lecture Notes in Computer Science, Vol. 11503). Springer, 459–474, 2019.

For **MKG-W**, the citation is:
> Xin Wang, Benyuan Meng, Hong Chen, Yuan Meng, Ke Lv, and Wenwu Zhu. *TIVA-KG: A Multimodal Knowledge Graph with Text, Image, Video and Audio*. In ACM Multimedia. ACM, 2391–2399, 2023.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described with its name, characteristics, and full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any critical details and that the citations are accurate and complete.
