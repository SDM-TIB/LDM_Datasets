To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Topic Shift Detection in Chinese Dialogues: Corpus and Benchmark" by Jiangyi Lin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and corpus sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors annotated a **Chinese Natural Topic Dialogue (CNTD) corpus** consisting of 1308 dialogues, which is a clear indication of a dataset.

Next, I will focus on the **corpus section** (Section 3), where the authors provide detailed information about the CNTD dataset. They describe its purpose, size, and the annotation process, confirming that this is a primary dataset for their research. The CNTD dataset is specifically designed to address the lack of annotated corpora for dialogue topic shift detection in Chinese.

In addition to the CNTD dataset, the authors reference another dataset, the **TIAGE dataset**, which is mentioned in the introduction and later in the experiments section. This dataset is used for comparison and evaluation purposes in their experiments.

Now, I will gather the full citations for both datasets from the **References section** of the paper:

1. For the **Chinese Natural Topic Dialogue (CNTD)** dataset, the citation is:
   > Jiangyi Lin, Yaxin Fan, Feng Jiang, Xiaomin Chu, and Peifeng Li. *Topic Shift Detection in Chinese Dialogues: Corpus and Benchmark*. In Proceedings of the 3rd Workshop on Natural Language Processing for Conversational AI, pages 1-15, 2023.

2. For the **TIAGE dataset**, the citation is:
   > Huiyuan Xie, Zhenghao Liu, Chenyan Xiong, Zhiyuan Liu, and Ann Copestake. *TIAGE: A Benchmark for Topic-Shift Aware Dialog Modeling*. In Findings of the Association for Computational Linguistics: EMNLP 2021, pages 1684â€“1690, 2021.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

- **CNTD Dataset**: A newly annotated corpus consisting of 1308 dialogues aimed at detecting topic shifts in Chinese dialogues.
- **TIAGE Dataset**: An existing dataset used for benchmarking topic shift detection in dialogues, consisting of 500 dialogues.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its citation.
