To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Distribution-induced Bidirectional Generative Adversarial Network for Graph Representation Learning" by Shuai Zheng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract and introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may highlight the datasets used for evaluation. In this case, the abstract does not explicitly mention any datasets.

Next, I will examine **section 4 (Experimental Results and Analysis)**, specifically looking for any subsections that detail the datasets used in the experiments. In the paper, I find a subsection titled **4.1 (Evaluation Setup and Metrics)**, which includes a table (Table 1) that lists the datasets used for evaluation.

The datasets mentioned in Table 1 are:

1. **Cora**: This dataset contains 2,708 nodes, 5,429 edges, 7 classes, and 1,433 features.
2. **Citeseer**: This dataset consists of 3,327 nodes, 4,732 edges, 6 classes, and 3,703 features.
3. **Pubmed**: This dataset has 19,717 nodes, 44,338 edges, 3 classes, and 500 features.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The paper cites the datasets as follows:

- For **Cora**, the citation is:
  > Lu, Q., & Getoor, L. (2003). Link-based classification. In Proceedings of the 20th International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML-03) (pp. 496-503).

- For **Citeseer**, the citation is:
  > Sen, P., Namata, G., Bilgic, M., Getoor, L., Galligher, B., & Eliassi-Rad, T. (2008). Collective classification in network data. AI Magazine, 29(3), 93-93.

- For **Pubmed**, the citation is:
  > Namata, G., London, B., Getoor, L., Huang, B., & UMD EDU. (2012). Query-driven active surveying for collective classification. In 10th International Workshop on Mining and Learning with Graphs (p. 8).

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use.

In summary, I have extracted the following datasets from the paper:

1. **Cora**: 
   - Citation: Lu, Q., & Getoor, L. (2003). Link-based classification. In Proceedings of the 20th International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML-03) (pp. 496-503).

2. **Citeseer**: 
   - Citation: Sen, P., Namata, G., Bilgic, M., Getoor, L., Galligher, B., & Eliassi-Rad, T. (2008). Collective classification in network data. AI Magazine, 29(3), 93-93.

3. **Pubmed**: 
   - Citation: Namata, G., London, B., Getoor, L., Huang, B., & UMD EDU. (2012). Query-driven active surveying for collective classification. In 10th International Workshop on Mining and Learning with Graphs (p. 8).

This process ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their full citations as required.
