To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Graph Attention Networks with Positional Embeddings" by Liheng Ma et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for experiments. In this case, the authors discuss their framework and its performance on various datasets, which indicates that datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will look at the **experiments section**, specifically **section 4 (Experiments and Results)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. Here, they mention using both non-homophilic and homophilic datasets. 

In **subsection 4.1 (Datasets)**, the authors provide a summary table (Table 1) that lists the datasets used in their experiments. The datasets mentioned are:

1. **Cora**: A citation network dataset with 2708 nodes, 5429 edges, 1433 features, and 7 classes.
2. **Citeseer**: Another citation network with 3327 nodes, 4732 edges, 3703 features, and 6 classes.
3. **Pubmed**: A dataset with 19717 nodes, 44338 edges, 500 features, and 3 classes.
4. **Chameleon**: A non-homophilic dataset with 2277 nodes, 36101 edges, 2325 features, and 5 classes.
5. **Squirrel**: Another non-homophilic dataset with 5201 nodes, 217073 edges, 2089 features, and 5 classes.
6. **Actor**: A co-occurrence network used as a non-homophilic dataset with 7600 nodes, 33544 edges, 931 features, and 5 classes.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The authors reference the original papers or sources for the datasets, which is crucial for proper citation. 

For the datasets mentioned, the citations are as follows:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured all necessary details for each dataset mentioned in the paper.
