To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DMM: Disparity-guided Multispectral Mamba for Oriented Object Detection in Remote Sensing" by Minghang Zhou et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. In the abstract, the authors mention that their method was validated on the **DroneVehicle and VEDAI datasets**, indicating that these are the datasets of interest.

Next, I will look for detailed descriptions of these datasets in the **experiments section**. The authors provide specific information about both datasets:

1. **DroneVehicle Dataset**: This dataset consists of 28,439 pairs of RGB and infrared images, annotated with oriented bounding boxes for five categories (car, bus, truck, van, and freight car), totaling 953,087 instances. The dataset is divided into training, validation, and test sets with specific numbers of image pairs for each set.

2. **VEDAI Dataset**: This dataset is designed for vehicle detection in high-resolution aerial images, containing 1,246 pairs of RGB and infrared images with oriented annotations for various vehicle types, including cars, trucks, and vans. The authors mention that they used the 512x512 version of the dataset and followed a ten-fold cross-validation protocol for training and testing.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **DroneVehicle Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Y. Sun, B. Cao, P. Zhu, and Q. Hu. "Drone-based RGB-infrared cross-modality vehicle detection via uncertainty-aware learning." *IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology*, vol. 32, no. 10, pp. 6700–6713, 2022.

- For the **VEDAI Dataset**, the citation is:
  > S. Razakarivony and F. Jurie. "Vehicle detection in aerial imagery: A small target detection benchmark." *Journal of Visual Communication and Image Representation*, vol. 34, pp. 187–203, 2016.

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
