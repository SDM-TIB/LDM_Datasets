To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "AdaptiveRec: Adaptively Construct Pairs for Contrastive Learning in Sequential Recommendation" by Jaeheyoung Jeon et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction typically outlines the context and significance of the work, including any datasets used. In this case, the introduction mentions the challenges in sequential recommendation systems, but I need to look further for specific dataset names.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4), as this is where datasets are usually detailed. In Section 4.1.1, the authors explicitly mention two datasets used in their experiments:

1. **MovieLens-1M**: This dataset consists of ratings of movies and is widely used in recommendation system research. 

2. **Amazon Beauty**: This dataset includes ratings for beauty products on Amazon and is also commonly used for evaluating recommendation models.

Both datasets are described as providing sequential data for individual users, capturing the items they purchased in chronological order.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **MovieLens-1M**, the citation is:
  > Harper, F. M., & Konstan, J. A. (2015). The MovieLens datasets: History and context. *ACM Transactions on Interactive Intelligent Systems (TIIS)*, 5(4), 1-19.

- For **Amazon Beauty**, the citation is:
  > McAuley, J., Targett, C., Shi, Q., & Van Den Hengel, A. (2015). Image-based recommendations on styles and substitutes. In *Proceedings of the 38th International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval* (pp. 43-52).

Having gathered the dataset names and their respective citations, I will now prepare to format this information according to the required structure, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described with its citation included. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research.
