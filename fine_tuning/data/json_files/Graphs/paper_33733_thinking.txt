To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Data Quality Aware Approaches for Addressing Model Drift of Semantic Segmentation Models" by Samiha Mirza et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract discusses the challenges of model drift and mentions the use of "multiple benchmark datasets," which indicates that specific datasets will likely be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets and evaluation methods)**, as this section is likely to provide explicit details about the datasets used in the experiments. Here, the authors mention three benchmark datasets for semantic segmentation:

1. **Adverse Environment Conditions dataset (ADE20K)**: This dataset consists of images belonging to nearly 150 classes and is used for semantic segmentation tasks.

2. **Cityscapes**: This dataset contains annotations for 30 classes and is commonly used for urban scene understanding.

3. **PASCAL Visual Object Classes (VOC)**: This dataset comprises 20 classes and is a well-known benchmark in the field of object detection and segmentation.

In this section, the authors also provide details about the number of images used from each dataset for training and testing, which is crucial for understanding the context of their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each of these datasets:

- For **ADE20K**, the citation is:
  > Zhou, B., Zhao, H., Puig, X., Fidler, S., et al. (2017). Scene parsing through ADE20K dataset. In CVPR.

- For **Cityscapes**, the citation is:
  > Cordts, M., Omran, M., Ramos, S., Rehfeld, T., et al. (2016). The Cityscapes dataset for semantic urban scene understanding. In CVPR.

- For **PASCAL VOC**, the citation is:
  > Everingham, M., Van Gool, L., Williams, C. K., et al. (2010). The PASCAL Visual Object Classes (VOC) challenge. International Journal of Computer Vision.

Having gathered the dataset names and their corresponding citations, I will now prepare to compile this information into a structured format for further use or analysis. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their references as required.
