To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Recovery from Adversarial Attacks in Cyber-physical Systems: Shallow, Deep and Exploratory Works" by Pengyuan Lu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections. These sections often provide a summary of the research focus and may mention specific datasets used in the study. In this case, the abstract does not explicitly mention any datasets, so I will proceed to the introduction.

Next, I will examine the **methodology and experiments sections** of the paper. These sections typically detail the datasets used for experiments or evaluations. I will look for any references to datasets, including their names, descriptions, and any relevant statistics.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention surveying a total of **30 relevant papers** related to CPS recovery, but they do not specify any datasets directly used in their own experiments. Instead, they categorize existing literature based on recovery methods and do not provide specific datasets utilized in their analysis.

Since no datasets are explicitly mentioned in the methodology or experiments sections, I will check the **References section** for any cited datasets. However, the references primarily consist of papers discussing various aspects of CPS recovery rather than specific datasets.

Given that the paper does not provide any datasets, I will summarize my findings as follows:

1. **No specific datasets were identified** in the paper "Recovery from Adversarial Attacks in Cyber-physical Systems: Shallow, Deep and Exploratory Works" by Pengyuan Lu et al.
2. The authors focus on surveying existing literature rather than presenting original datasets.

In conclusion, I will document that no datasets were extracted from this paper, and I will ensure to note the full citation of the paper itself for reference:
> Pengyuan Lu, Lin Zhang, Mengyu Liu, Kaustubh Sridhar, Oleg Sokolsky, Fanxin Kong, and Insup Lee. 2024. Recovery from Adversarial Attacks in Cyber-physical Systems: Shallow, Deep and Exploratory Works. ACM Comput. Surv. 1, 1, Article 1 (January 2024), 31 pages. https://doi.org/10.1145/3653974

This structured approach ensures that I have thoroughly searched for datasets while maintaining a clear record of the findings and citations.
