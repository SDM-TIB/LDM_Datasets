To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Robust Deep Visual Representations from EEG Brain Recordings" by Prajwal Singh et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the study demonstrates the generalizability of the feature extraction pipeline across three different datasets. This indicates that multiple datasets are utilized, and I need to identify them.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used for training and testing. Here, they mention three datasets:

1. **EEGCVPR40 Dataset**: This dataset consists of EEG-Image pairs for 40 classes, derived from the ImageNet dataset. It includes approximately 11,800 EEG-Image pairs recorded from participants viewing images.

2. **ThoughtViz Dataset**: A small-scale dataset consisting of 10 different object classes, also a subset of the ImageNet dataset. It includes EEG recordings from 23 participants visualizing these classes.

3. **Object Dataset**: This dataset consists of 6 classes, each with 12 images shown to participants, with EEG signals recorded during the process.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper:

- For the **EEGCVPR40 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Concetto Spampinato, Simone Palazzo, Isaak Kavasidis, Daniela Giordano, Nasim Souly, and Mubarak Shah. *Deep learning human mind for automated visual classification*. In Proceedings of the IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pages 6809–6817, 2017.

- For the **ThoughtViz Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Praveen Tirupattur, Yogesh Singh Rawat, Concetto Spampinato, and Mubarak Shah. *Thoughtviz: Visualizing human thoughts using generative adversarial network*. In Proceedings of the 26th ACM international conference on Multimedia, pages 950–958, 2018.

- For the **Object Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Blair Kaneshiro, Marcos Perreau Guimaraes, Hyung-Suk Kim, Anthony M Norcia, and Patrick Suppes. *A representational similarity analysis of the dynamics of object processing using single-trial EEG classification*. Plos one, 10(8):e0135697, 2015.

Now that I have the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their respective citations.
