To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ConPro: Learning Severity Representation for Medical Images using Contrastive Learning and Preference Optimization" by Hong Nguyen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant details, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, method, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may highlight key datasets used for evaluation. 

In the **introduction**, I will look for any references to datasets that are foundational to the research. The authors may discuss existing datasets or introduce new ones relevant to their work.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly the subsection titled **Datasets and Preprocessing**. Here, the authors explicitly describe the datasets they used, including their characteristics and any relevant statistics. 

From the text, I identify two datasets:

1. **Papilledema Dataset**: This dataset consists of 331 pediatric fundus images collected from 105 subjects, featuring a five-level severity rating for Papilledema. The dataset is stored in a HIPAA-compliant database.

2. **VinDr-Mammo Dataset**: This is a public dataset containing 5,000 full-field digital mammography examinations, which includes breast-level evaluations and annotations. The dataset assesses severity using the Breast Imaging-Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) with categories ranging from 0 to 6.

Now, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for these datasets. 

- For the **Papilledema Dataset**, the citation is not explicitly provided in the text, but it is important to note that it is a controlled dataset from clinical sources.

- For the **VinDr-Mammo Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Hieu T. Nguyen, Ha Q. Nguyen, Hieu H. Pham, Khanh Lam, Linh T. Le, Minh Dao, and Van Vu. *VinDr-Mammo: A large-scale benchmark dataset for computer-aided diagnosis in full-field digital mammography*. medRxiv, 2022.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will allow for a structured output that can be used for further analysis or reference.
