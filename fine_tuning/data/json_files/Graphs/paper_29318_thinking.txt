To extract datasets from the research paper titled "PAnDR: Fast Adaptation to New Environments from Offline Experiences via Decoupling Policy and Environment Representations" by Tong Sang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for evaluation or experimentation.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors often discuss the context of their research and may reference existing datasets that are relevant to their work. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or benchmarks.

In the **methodology section**, particularly in subsections that detail the experimental setup, I will look for specific datasets used for training and testing. This section often contains the most detailed descriptions of the datasets, including their characteristics and how they were utilized in the experiments.

I will also examine the **experiments section**, where the authors typically describe the results obtained using the datasets. This section may provide additional insights into the datasets, such as their size, structure, and any preprocessing steps taken.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** of the paper to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, if the authors mention using datasets like "Ant-Wind" or "HalfCheetah-Mass," I will look for the original papers or sources that describe these datasets to provide accurate citations.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is clearly documented for future reference.

In summary, my approach involves:
1. Reading the abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections for dataset mentions.
2. Identifying specific datasets and their characteristics.
3. Checking the references for full citations of each dataset.
4. Compiling the information into a structured format for clarity and accessibility.
