To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Attention-based Interactive Disentangling Network for Instance-level Emotional Voice Conversion" by Yun Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of a dataset called the **Emotional Speech Dataset (ESD)**, which is a strong indicator that this is a key dataset used in the research.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (section 3) where the authors provide details about the dataset used for training their model. Here, they specify that they trained their model on 10 English speakers from the **Emotional Speech Dataset (ESD)**, which includes five emotions. They also mention the number of training, validation, and test speeches per speaker, which is important for understanding the dataset's structure.

In the **experiments section**, they provide additional context about how the data was prepared, including the creation of source-reference speech pairs for the emotional voice conversion task. This further confirms the significance of the ESD in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the **Emotional Speech Dataset (ESD)**. The citation is as follows:
> Zhou, K., Sisman, B., Liu, R., & Li, H. (2021). Seen and unseen emotional style transfer for voice conversion with a new emotional speech dataset. In ICASSP (pp. 920â€“924). IEEE.

With this information, I have identified the dataset used in the research and its full citation. 

Now, I will summarize the findings:
1. **Emotional Speech Dataset (ESD)**: This dataset is used for training the model and consists of 10 English speakers with five emotions, including specific training, validation, and test splits.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
