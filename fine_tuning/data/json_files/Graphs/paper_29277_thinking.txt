To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Weakly-supervised Temporal Path Representation Learning with Contrastive Curriculum Learning" by Sean Bin Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experimental studies involving three downstream tasks on three road networks, indicating that datasets are likely discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental setup section** where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they provide specific details about three datasets:

1. **Aalborg, Denmark**: This dataset consists of a road network graph from OpenStreetMap, with 10,017 nodes and 11,597 edges. It includes 180 million GPS records from 183 vehicles sampled at 1 Hz over a two-year period, yielding a total of 28,370 paths.

2. **Harbin, China**: This dataset was collected from 13,000 taxis in Harbin, with a corresponding road network extracted from OpenStreetMap containing 8,497 nodes and 14,497 edges. After map matching, the dataset includes 58,977 paths.

3. **Chengdu, China**: Collected during October and November 2016, this dataset also has a road network from OpenStreetMap, consisting of 6,632 nodes and 17,038 edges, resulting in 57,404 paths after map matching.

I will then look for the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are typically included in the references, and I will ensure to format them correctly.

The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **Aalborg dataset**:
  > Yang, S. B., Guo, C., Hu, J., & Jensen, C. S. (2020). Context-aware, preference-based vehicle routing. *VLDB Journal*, 29(5), 1149-1170.

- For the **Harbin dataset**:
  > Li, X., Cong, G., Sun, A., & Cheng, Y. (2019). Learning travel time distributions with deep generative model. In *Proceedings of the World Wide Web Conference* (pp. 1017-1027).

- For the **Chengdu dataset**:
  > Liu, H., Han, J., Fu, Y., Zhou, J., Lu, X., & Xiong, H. (2020). Multi-modal transportation recommendation with unified route representation learning. *Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment*, 14(3), 342-350.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented and properly cited.
