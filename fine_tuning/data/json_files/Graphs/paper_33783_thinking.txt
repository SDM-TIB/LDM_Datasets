To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ASGEA: Exploiting Logic Rules from Align-Subgraphs for Entity Alignment" by Yangyifei Luo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study and may mention datasets used for evaluation. The introduction typically outlines the context and significance of the research, which might include references to specific datasets.

In the **experiments section**, I will look for a dedicated subsection that discusses the datasets used. This is often where authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets, including their characteristics and how they were utilized in the experiments.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that in **section 4 (Experiment)**, the authors mention several datasets:

1. **MMKG (Liu et al., 2019)**: This dataset includes two subsets: **FB15K-DB15K (FBDB15K)** and **FB15K-YAGO15K (FBYG15K)**. The authors note that these datasets are split into three subsets based on the ratio of seed alignments: Rsa ∈ {0.2, 0.5, 0.8}.

2. **DBP15K (Sun et al., 2017)**: This dataset is derived from multilingual versions of DBpedia and includes three subsets: **DBP15KZH-EN**, **DBP15KJA-EN**, and **DBP15KFR-EN**. The authors also mention a multi-modal variant of these datasets (Liu et al., 2021), which enhances the entities with corresponding images.

3. **Multi-OpenEA (Li et al., 2023b)**: This dataset consists of multi-modal variants of the OpenEA benchmarks (Sun et al., 2020b) and includes datasets such as **EN-FR-15K**, **EN-DE-15K**, **D-W-15K-V1**, and **D-W-15K-V2**. The authors specify that they selected only the rank one image for each entity.

Next, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

- For **MMKG**, the citation is:
  > Liu, Y., Chen, M., Roth, D., & Collier, N. (2019). MMKG: Multi-modal knowledge graphs. In ESWC, volume 11503 of Lecture Notes in Computer Science, pages 459–474. Springer.

- For **DBP15K**, the citation is:
  > Sun, Z., Hu, W., & Li, C. (2017). Cross-lingual entity alignment via joint attribute-preserving embedding. In ISWC (1), volume 10587 of Lecture Notes in Computer Science, pages 628–644. Springer.

- For **Multi-OpenEA**, the citation is:
  > Li, Y., Chen, J., Li, Y., Xiang, Y., Chen, X., & Zheng, H.-T. (2023b). Vision, deduction and alignment: An empirical study on multi-modal knowledge graph alignment. In ICASSP, pages 1–5. IEEE.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
