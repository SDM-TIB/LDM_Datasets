To extract datasets from the research paper titled "What Makes Good Collaborative Views? Contrastive Mutual Information Maximization for Multi-Agent Perception" by Wanfang Su et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions evaluating the proposed method on **V2X-Sim 1.0**, which indicates that this is a dataset used in their experiments.

Next, I will look for more details about the dataset in the **experiments section**. Here, the authors describe **V2X-Sim 1.0** as a multi-agent 3D object detection dataset created through the joint simulation of CARLA-SUMO. They provide specific details about the dataset, including that it consists of 104 frames from 100 scenes, with each scene containing 2-5 vehicles. This information is crucial for understanding the dataset's scope and application.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the **V2X-Sim 1.0** dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:
> Li, Y.; Ma, D.; An, Z.; Wang, Z.; Zhong, Y.; Chen, S.; and Feng, C. 2022. V2X-Sim: Multi-agent collaborative perception dataset and benchmark for autonomous driving. IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters, 7(4): 10914â€“10921.

Since this is the only dataset explicitly mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information regarding **V2X-Sim 1.0** into a structured format, ensuring to include the full citation as it is essential for proper referencing.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will prepare the dataset entry accordingly, ensuring that it is ready for review or further processing.
