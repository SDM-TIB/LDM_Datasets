To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Representation for Anomaly Detection of Vehicle Trajectories" by Ruochen Jiao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the importance of detecting anomalous vehicle trajectories and hints at the use of datasets for experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors mention conducting experiments with two datasets: **Argoverse 1** and **Argoverse 2**. I will look for specific details about these datasets, such as their characteristics, size, and the context in which they were used.

In the **experiment setup section**, the authors provide more information about the datasets:
1. **Argoverse 1**: This dataset contains over 30,000 driving scenarios collected in Miami and Pittsburgh, which includes road graphs and trajectories of multiple agents.
2. **Argoverse 2**: This dataset collects longer and more complex driving scenarios across six cities, also including road graphs and trajectories.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations for the datasets are:
- For **Argoverse 1**:
  > Chang, M.-F., Lambert, J., Sangkloy, P., Singh, J., Bak, S., Hartnett, A., Wang, D., Carr, P., Lucey, S., Ramanan, D., et al. "Argoverse: 3D tracking and forecasting with rich maps." In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2019, pp. 8748â€“8757.

- For **Argoverse 2**:
  > Wilson, B., Qi, W., Agarwal, T., Lambert, J., Singh, J., Khandelwal, S., Pan, B., Kumar, R., Hartnett, A., Pontes, J. K., et al. "Argoverse 2: Next generation datasets for self-driving perception and forecasting." arXiv preprint arXiv:2301.00493, 2023.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all relevant details are captured for future reference or processing.
