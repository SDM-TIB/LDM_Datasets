To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "3D Human Pose Estimation Using Möbius Graph Convolutional Networks" by Niloofar Azizi et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. In the abstract, the authors state that they evaluate their approach on **two challenging pose estimation benchmarks**, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental results section** (section 5) where the authors discuss the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they mention:

1. **Human3.6M**: This dataset contains 3.6 million images produced by 11 actors performing 15 actions, captured using four calibrated RGB cameras. The authors specify that they use five subjects for training and two for testing.

2. **MPI-INF-3DHP**: This dataset is used to test the generalization capabilities of their model. It contains data from six subjects tested in three different scenarios: studio with a green screen, studio without a green screen, and outdoor scenes.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Human3.6M**, the citation is:
  > Catalin Ionescu, Dragos Papava, Vlad Olaru, and Cristian Sminchisescu. *Human3.6M: Large Scale Datasets and Predictive Methods for 3D Human Sensing in Natural Environments*. IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 36(7):1325–1339, 2014.

- For **MPI-INF-3DHP**, the citation is:
  > D. Mehta, H. Rhodin, D. Casas, P. Fua, O. Sotnychenko, W. Xu, and C. Theobalt. *Monocular 3D Human Pose Estimation In The Wild Using Improved CNN Supervision*. In 3DV, 2017.

With these citations, I have gathered all necessary information about the datasets used in the paper. I will now compile this information into a structured format for further processing.
