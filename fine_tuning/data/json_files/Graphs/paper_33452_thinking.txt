To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Distribution-Agnostic Generalized Category Discovery" by Jianhong Bai et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, and the introduction often discusses the context and relevance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention that they conduct experiments on various datasets, which indicates that multiple datasets are involved. I will look for specific names of datasets in this section.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental setup section** (Section 5) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments in detail. Here, they mention four datasets:

1. **CIFAR-10-LT**: A long-tail subset sampled from the original CIFAR-10 dataset, with an imbalance ratio set to 100.
2. **CIFAR-100-LT**: Similar to CIFAR-10-LT, this is a long-tail subset from CIFAR-100, also with an imbalance ratio of 100.
3. **ImageNet-100-LT**: A dataset comprising 12,000 images sampled from ImageNet-100, using a Pareto distribution.
4. **Places-LT**: A dataset containing approximately 62,500 images sampled from the Places dataset, also using a Pareto distribution.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For **CIFAR-10-LT** and **CIFAR-100-LT**, the original datasets are cited as:
- **CIFAR-10**: Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. *CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets*. 2009.
- **CIFAR-100**: Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. *CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets*. 2009.

For **ImageNet-100-LT**, the citation is:
- **ImageNet**: Olga Russakovsky, Jia Deng, Hao Sheng, et al. *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 115(3):211-252, 2015.

For **Places-LT**, the citation is:
- **Places**: Bolei Zhou, Agata Lapedriza, Aditya Khosla, Aude Oliva, and Antonio Torralba. *Places: A 10 million image database for scene recognition*. IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 40(6):1452-1464, 2017.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant datasets from the paper.
