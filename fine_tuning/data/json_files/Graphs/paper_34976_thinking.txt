To extract datasets from the research paper titled "202.3 Tb/s Transmission over Field-Deployed Fibre using 15.6 THz S+C+L-Bands" by Jiaqian Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, experimental demonstration, results and discussion, and conclusions sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's achievements, but it may not specify datasets directly. 

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to see if the authors reference any datasets or prior works that utilized specific datasets. This section often provides context and may mention datasets used in previous studies.

In the **experimental demonstration section**, I will look for any specific datasets or experimental setups that involve data collection. The authors describe their experimental setup, including the use of a field-deployed fibre link, but I need to determine if they reference any datasets explicitly.

The **results and discussion section** is crucial as it often contains detailed analysis and may refer to datasets used for comparison or validation of results. I will look for any tables, figures, or descriptions that indicate the datasets used in their experiments.

Finally, I will check the **references section** for any citations that correspond to datasets mentioned in the paper. This is important for obtaining the full citations needed for each dataset.

Throughout this process, I will take notes on any datasets mentioned, including their names, descriptions, and the context in which they were used. If the authors refer to datasets from other studies, I will ensure to include those citations as well.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes a clear description and the full citation for each dataset as per the requirements.

By following these steps, I will ensure a thorough extraction of datasets from the paper while maintaining the integrity of the citations.
