To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Low-rank Tensor Estimation via Riemannian Gauss-Newton: Statistical Optimality and Second-Order Convergence" by Yuetian Luo and Anru R. Zhang, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

Next, I will look for specific sections that typically contain dataset information, such as **"Datasets," "Experiments," or "Results."** In this paper, the authors discuss applications in machine learning, which may indicate the use of specific datasets for validation.

In the **experiments section**, I will pay close attention to any mentions of datasets used for simulations or evaluations. The authors may describe the datasets, including their characteristics, size, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets.

For example, if the authors mention using a dataset like the **ADHD-200 dataset** for their experiments, I will look for the full citation, which might be formatted as follows:
> ADHD-200 Consortium. *The ADHD-200 Sample: A Publicly Available Resource for the Study of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder*. Available at: http://neurobureau.projects.nitrc.org/ADHD200/Data.html.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference.

Finally, I will ensure that each dataset entry includes:
1. The name of the dataset.
2. A brief description of the dataset.
3. The full citation for the dataset.

This structured approach will help ensure that I accurately capture all relevant dataset information from the paper while maintaining proper academic standards for citation.
