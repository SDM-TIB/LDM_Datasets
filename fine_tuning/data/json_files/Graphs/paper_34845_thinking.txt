To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Non-Adversarial Learning: Vector-Quantized Common Latent Space for Multi-Sequence MRI" by Luyi Han et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the experiments utilize the **BraTS2021 dataset**, which indicates that this dataset is significant for the research. I will note this down as a primary dataset.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (Section 3) where the authors discuss the dataset and evaluation metrics. Here, they provide more details about the **BraTS2021 dataset**, stating that it comprises 1,251 subjects with four aligned sequences: T1, T1Gd, T2, and Flair. This section confirms the dataset's relevance and provides context for its use in the experiments.

I will also check the **methods section** to see if there are any additional datasets mentioned or if the authors elaborate further on the BraTS2021 dataset. However, it appears that the focus remains on the BraTS2021 dataset for the experiments.

Now, I will consult the **references section** to find the full citation for the BraTS2021 dataset. The relevant citation is:

- For **BraTS2021 dataset**:
  > Baid, U., Ghodasara, S., Mohan, S., Bilello, M., Calabrese, E., Colak, E., Farahani, K., Kalpathy-Cramer, J., Kitamura, F.C., Pati, S., et al. "The rsna-asnr-miccai brats 2021 benchmark on brain tumor segmentation and radiogenomic classification." arXiv preprint arXiv:2107.02314 (2021).

After gathering this information, I will summarize the dataset details, ensuring to include the full citation for the BraTS2021 dataset. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the dataset used in the research.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format for clarity and future reference.
