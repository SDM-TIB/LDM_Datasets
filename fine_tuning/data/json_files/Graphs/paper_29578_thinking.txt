To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Micro-video recommendation model based on graph neural network and attention mechanism" by Chan Ching Ting et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention any datasets used. The introduction often elaborates on the problem being addressed and may reference specific datasets that are relevant to the study.

Next, I will look closely at **section 4 (Experiments)**, as this section typically contains detailed information about the datasets used in the experiments. In this paper, the authors mention two datasets:

1. **MovieLens-1M**: This dataset is described as containing 1,000,209 ratings from 6,040 users for 3,900 movies. The authors note that they transformed it into implicit data for their experiments.

2. **Amazon Instant Video**: This dataset consists of 426,922 users, 23,965 videos, and 583,933 ratings. Similar to the MovieLens dataset, it was also transformed into implicit data for the study.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For the **MovieLens-1M dataset**, the citation is:
> Harper, F. M., & Konstan, J. A. (2015). The MovieLens Datasets: History, Research, and Applications. *ACM Transactions on Interactive Intelligent Systems (TIIS)*, 5(4), 1-19.

For the **Amazon Instant Video dataset**, the citation is:
> McAuley, J., Targett, C., Shi, Q., & Van Den Hengel, A. (2015). Image-based recommendations on styles and substitutes. In *Proceedings of the 38th International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval* (pp. 43-52).

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their proper citations.
