To extract datasets from the research paper titled "TCLR: Temporal Contrastive Learning for Video Representation" by Ishan Dave et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that the proposed method achieves significant improvements on various downstream video understanding tasks using multiple datasets, which indicates that datasets are likely discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they explicitly mention three datasets:

1. **UCF101**: This dataset is described as containing around 13,320 videos representing 101 different human activities. The authors use it for action recognition tasks.

2. **Kinetics400**: This is a large-scale dataset with 400 action classes and 222,454 training videos. It is also used for action recognition tasks.

3. **HMDB51**: This dataset consists of approximately 7,000 videos collected from 51 different human actions, and it is used for action recognition as well.

In the **Datasets and Implementation section**, the authors provide additional details about each dataset, confirming their use in the experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **UCF101**, the citation is:
  > Khurram Soomro, Amir Roshan Zamir, and Mubarak Shah. *UCF101: A dataset of 101 human action classes from videos in the wild*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1212.0402, 2012.

- For **Kinetics400**, the citation is:
  > Joao Carreira and Andrew Zisserman. *Quo vadis, action recognition? A new model and the kinetics dataset*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 6299â€“6308, 2017.

- For **HMDB51**, the citation is:
  > H. Kuehne, H. Jhuang, E. Garrote, T. Poggio, and T. Serre. *HMDB: A large video database for human motion recognition*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Computer Vision, 2011.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
