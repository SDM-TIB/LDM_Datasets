To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Out-of-Distribution Generalized Dynamic Graph Neural Network for Human Albumin Prediction" by Zeyang Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and materials sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions a dataset called **Albumin level testing and nutritional dosing data for Intensive Care (ANIC)**, which indicates that this is a primary dataset used in the research.

Next, I will focus on the **Materials section**, specifically section II, where the authors provide a detailed description of the ANIC dataset. They explain that this dataset consists of real patient data collected from ICU patients, including various features such as demographic characteristics, nutritional support, and biochemical markers. The authors also mention that the dataset contains 5,727 ICU patients and 31,106 records, which provides context about its scale and relevance.

In the **Dataset Construction subsection**, the authors elaborate on how the dataset was constructed, including the types of data collected and the time frame (2014 to 2020). This information is crucial for understanding the dataset's context and applicability.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the ANIC dataset. However, since the dataset is newly introduced in this paper, it may not have an external citation. Instead, I will note that the dataset is described in detail within the paper itself.

Now, I will summarize the findings regarding the dataset:

1. **Dataset Name**: Albumin level testing and nutritional dosing data for Intensive Care (ANIC)
   - **Description**: This dataset includes real patient data collected from ICU patients, containing demographic characteristics, nutritional support, and biochemical markers. It consists of 5,727 patients and 31,106 records, covering the period from 2014 to 2020.
   - **Citation**: Since this dataset is introduced in the paper and does not have an external citation, I will reference the paper itself as the source.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing, ensuring that the dataset name, description, and citation are clearly presented. This will allow for easy access and understanding of the dataset's relevance to the research conducted in the paper.
