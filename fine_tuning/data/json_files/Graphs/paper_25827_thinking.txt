To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Boosted Cascaded Convnets for Multilabel Classification of Thoracic Diseases in Chest Radiographs" by Pulkit Kumar et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the **ChestX-ray14 dataset**, which is a significant indicator that this dataset is central to the research.

Next, I will look closely at the **introduction** section, where the authors describe the ChestX-ray14 dataset in detail. They state that it contains **112,120 frontal X-ray images** with annotations for **14 thoracic diseases**. This confirms that the dataset is indeed used for their experiments.

In the **methods section**, the authors reiterate their use of the ChestX-ray14 dataset, specifying that they randomly separated **20% of the dataset for testing** and used the rest for training. This further solidifies the dataset's role in their research.

I will also check the **results section** to see if there are any additional datasets mentioned or if the authors provide further context about the ChestX-ray14 dataset. However, it appears that the focus remains on this dataset throughout the paper.

Now, I will consult the **references section** to find the full citation for the ChestX-ray14 dataset. The relevant citation is:

- For **ChestX-ray14 dataset**:
  > X. Wang, Y. Peng, L. Lu, Z. Lu, M. Bagheri, and R. M. Summers. *ChestX-ray8: Hospital-scale Chest X-ray Database and Benchmarks on Weakly-Supervised Classification and Localization of Common Thorax Diseases*. 2017.

Since the authors refer to the ChestX-ray14 dataset, I will ensure to use the correct citation format as provided in the references.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare to create an entry for the dataset, ensuring that I include the full citation as it is crucial for proper attribution and reference.

In summary, I will compile the dataset entry for the ChestX-ray14 dataset, ensuring that it includes all necessary details and the full citation for clarity and completeness.
