To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Modelling Neighbor Relation in Joint Space-Time Graph for Video Correspondence Learning" by Zixu Zhao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for evaluation. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets in relation to the research problem.

Next, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. This section typically details the datasets used for training and evaluation, including any specific characteristics or splits that are relevant to the study. I will pay close attention to any tables or figures that summarize the datasets.

In this paper, I will specifically look for mentions of datasets like **Kinetics400**, **DAVIS 2017**, **VIP**, and **JHMDB**, as these are common benchmarks in video analysis and may be referenced in the context of the experiments.

Once I identify the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily.

For example, I will look for the following datasets and their citations:

1. **Kinetics400**: This dataset is often cited in video-related research. The citation typically includes the authors, title, conference, and year of publication.

2. **DAVIS 2017**: This dataset is used for video object segmentation tasks. I will find the citation that describes its creation and purpose.

3. **VIP**: The Video Instance Parsing dataset may also have a specific citation that details its use in the context of video parsing tasks.

4. **JHMDB**: This dataset is commonly used for action recognition and pose estimation. I will ensure to find its citation as well.

After gathering the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will help in accurately documenting the datasets used in the research.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for output, ensuring they are clear and ready for any further processing or review.
