To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Convolutional Neural Networks for Molecular Subtyping of Gliomas Using Magnetic Resonance Imaging" by Dong Wei et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that a dataset comprising **1,016 real patients** was collected for evaluation, which suggests that this is a key dataset to note.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the **Study Cohort and MRI Data** subsection. Here, the authors describe the inclusion criteria for the study cohort, confirming that the dataset consists of **1,016 patients** diagnosed with primary diffuse gliomas. This section provides important details about the data collection process and the types of MRI data used (T1-weighted, T1 contrast enhancement, and T2-weighted images).

In the **results section**, the authors discuss the performance of their model on the dataset, but they do not introduce any new datasets. The focus remains on the analysis of the existing dataset.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the dataset. However, since the dataset is based on real patients treated at a specific hospital and does not have a formal citation like publicly available datasets, I will note that the dataset is derived from patients treated at the **Beijing Tiantan Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, PR China**.

The dataset can be summarized as follows:

1. **Dataset Name**: Glioma Patient Dataset
   - **Description**: A dataset comprising 1,016 patients diagnosed with primary diffuse gliomas, including MRI data (T1-weighted, T1 contrast enhancement, and T2-weighted images).
   - **Source**: Patients treated at Beijing Tiantan Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, PR China.

Since this dataset does not have a formal citation, I will note the source institution instead.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format for further processing or review.
