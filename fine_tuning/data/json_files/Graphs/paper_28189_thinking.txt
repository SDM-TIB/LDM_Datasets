To extract datasets from the research paper titled "EncoderMI: Membership Inference against Pre-trained Encoders in Contrastive Learning" by Hongbin Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method on multiple datasets, which suggests that there are specific datasets to look for.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this paper, they mention three datasets:

1. **CIFAR10**: This dataset contains 60,000 color images across 10 object categories, with 50,000 training images and 10,000 testing images. Each image is sized at 32x32 pixels.

2. **STL10**: This dataset consists of 13,000 labeled color images from 10 classes, divided into 5,000 training images and 8,000 testing images. It also includes 100,000 unlabeled images, with each image sized at 96x96 pixels.

3. **Tiny-ImageNet**: This dataset contains 100,000 training images and 10,000 testing images from 200 classes, with each class having 500 training images and 50 testing images. Each image is sized at 64x64 pixels.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **CIFAR10**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky. 2009. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. Tech Report.

- For **STL10**, the citation is:
  > Adam Coates, Andrew Ng, and Honglak Lee. 2011. *An analysis of single-layer networks in unsupervised feature learning*. In AISTATS.

- For **Tiny-ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > MicroImageNet classification challenge. 2021. *https://www.kaggle.com/c/tiny-imagenet/overview*.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and that the full citations are included. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, which is essential for reproducibility and further research.
