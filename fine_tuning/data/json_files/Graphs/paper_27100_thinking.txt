To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Unify Local and Global Information for Top-𝑁 Recommendation" by Xiaoming Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections for any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on two real-world datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will look into **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they explicitly mention two datasets:

1. **MovieLens-1M**: This dataset contains approximately 1 million explicit ratings from the MovieLens website. The authors note that they extracted the 10-core data to ensure data quality.

2. **Last.FM**: This dataset includes musician listening information from a set of 2,000 users from the Last.FM online music system. Similar to MovieLens, they also use a 10-core setting to ensure that each user-item pair has at least ten interactions.

In the same section, the authors provide statistics about these datasets, including the number of users, items, interactions, entities, relations, and triplets, which further confirms the details of the datasets.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. However, since these datasets are widely known and commonly used in research, they may not have formal citations in the references. Instead, I will provide the general sources where these datasets can be found:

- For **MovieLens-1M**, the citation is:
  > GroupLens Research. *MovieLens Datasets*. Available at: https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/

- For **Last.FM**, the citation is:
  > GroupLens Research. *Last.FM Dataset*. Available at: https://grouplens.org/datasets/hetrec-2011/

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets and their citations in a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly identified along with its source.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured output that is ready for review or further processing.
