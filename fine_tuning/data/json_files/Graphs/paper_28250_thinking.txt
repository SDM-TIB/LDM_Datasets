To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Dynamic Modeling of Hand-Object Interactions via Tactile Sensing" by Qiang Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or data collection methods.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly the subsections that detail the data collection setup and dataset statistics. In this paper, the authors describe the activities performed with the tactile glove and the objects used, which are crucial for understanding the datasets.

In the **experiments section**, I find a table (Table I) that summarizes the dataset statistics for the activities "Wave" and "Throw." The authors mention that they collected data for 15 different objects, with 12 seen and 3 unseen objects. The dataset is split into training and evaluation sets, which is important for understanding how the data is structured.

The paper also discusses the **data collection setup**, where a human subject wears a tactile glove to perform various hand-object interaction activities. This setup is essential for understanding the context of the datasets.

Now, I will look at the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets or related works mentioned. The authors reference a tactile glove developed by Sundaram et al. (2019), which is crucial for the dataset's context. The citation is as follows:
- Sundaram, S., Kellnhofer, P., Li, Y., Zhu, J.-Y., Torralba, A., & Matusik, W. (2019). Learning the signatures of the human grasp using a scalable tactile glove. *Nature*, 569(7758), 698â€“702.

Additionally, the authors reference other works related to tactile sensing and hand-object interactions, which may provide context for the datasets used.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, along with their respective citations for further reference.
