To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DVG-Face: Dual Variational Generation for Heterogeneous Face Recognition" by Chaoyou Fu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the method achieves superior performance on seven challenging databases related to heterogeneous face recognition tasks. This indicates that multiple datasets are likely discussed.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly **section 4.1 (Databases and Protocols)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they explicitly mention several datasets:

1. **CASIA NIR-VIS 2.0 Face Database**: This dataset contains 725 identities, with each identity having a varying number of NIR and VIS images. The authors provide details about the training and testing protocols.

2. **BUAA-VisNir Face Database**: This dataset consists of 150 identities, with multiple NIR and VIS images per identity. The authors describe how they split the dataset into training and testing sets.

3. **IIIT-D Sketch Viewed Database**: This dataset is used for Sketch-Photo recognition and contains 238 image pairs from various sources.

4. **Tufts Face Database**: This dataset includes 113 identities with multiple cross-domain images. The authors detail how they selected training and testing sets from this database.

5. **Oulu-CASIA NIR-VIS Database**: This dataset is mentioned in the supplementary material and is used for NIR-VIS recognition tasks.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and will be formatted as follows:

  > Li, S., Yi, D., Lei, Z., & Liao, S. (2013). The CASIA NIR-VIS 2.0 face database. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured all relevant details for each dataset mentioned in the paper.
