To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SwAMP: Swapped Assignment of Multi-Modal Pairs for Cross-Modal Retrieval" by Minyoung Kim, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors tested their method on several real-world cross-modal retrieval problems, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically looking for any subsections that detail the datasets used. In the paper, the author mentions three datasets for the text-based video retrieval task:

1. **YouCook2**: This dataset consists of cooking videos and instructions, containing 14,000 video clips annotated with textual descriptions. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Zhou, L., Xu, C., & Corso, J. J. (2018). Towards automatic learning of procedures from web instructional videos. In Proceedings of the Thirty-Second AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI-18).

2. **MSR-VTT**: This dataset includes 200,000 video-caption pairs collected from YouTube, covering various categories like music and sports. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Xu, J., Mei, T., Yao, T., & Rui, Y. (2016). MSR-VTT: A large video description dataset for bridging video and language. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR).

3. **LSMDC**: This dataset comprises 101,000 video-caption pairs from movie clips, with captions collected from movie scripts or audio descriptions. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Rohrbach, M., Torabi, A., Rohrbach, A., Tandon, N., Pal, C., Larochelle, H., Courville, A., & Schiele, B. (2017). Movie description. International Journal of Computer Vision, 123(1), 94-120.

In addition to these datasets, I will also check the **References section** to ensure I have the correct citations and any additional datasets mentioned in other parts of the paper.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described accurately and includes its full citation. This structured approach will help me extract the datasets effectively while maintaining the integrity of the information presented in the paper.
