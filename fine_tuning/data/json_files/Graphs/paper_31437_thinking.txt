To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Tiny Machine Learning Model for Point Cloud Object Classification" by Min Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. In the abstract, the authors mention evaluating their model on **ModelNet40** and **ScanObjectNN** datasets. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for the experiments conducted in the paper.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section (Section 4)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used. In **Section 4.1**, they discuss the **ModelNet40 dataset**, stating it contains 9,843 training samples and 2,468 test samples across 40 object categories. This section confirms the dataset's relevance and provides specific details about its structure.

In **Section 4.3**, the authors describe the **ScanObjectNN dataset**, which consists of objects extracted from real-world scenes, specifically mentioning the "object only" scenario with 2,309 training samples and 581 test samples from 15 object classes. This further solidifies the importance of this dataset in their evaluation.

Now, I will refer to the **References section** to gather the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **ModelNet40 dataset**, the citation is:
   > Zhirong Wu, Shuran Song, Aditya Khosla, Fisher Yu, Linguang Zhang, Xiaoou Tang, and Jianxiong Xiao. *3D ShapeNets: A Deep Representation for Volumetric Shapes*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 1912–1920, 2015.

2. For the **ScanObjectNN dataset**, the citation is:
   > Mikaela Angelina Uy, Quang-Hieu Pham, Binh-Son Hua, Thanh Nguyen, and Sai-Kit Yeung. *Revisiting Point Cloud Classification: A New Benchmark Dataset and Classification Model on Real-World Data*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision, pages 1588–1597, 2019.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

- **ModelNet40**: A dataset containing 9,843 training samples and 2,468 test samples across 40 object categories.
- **ScanObjectNN**: A dataset consisting of 2,309 training samples and 581 test samples from 15 object classes, focusing on real-world scenarios.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
