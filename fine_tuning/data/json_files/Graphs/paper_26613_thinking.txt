To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning to Solve Combinatorial Optimization Problems on Real-World Graphs in Linear Time" by Iddo Drori et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the development of a framework for solving combinatorial optimization problems, but it does not explicitly mention datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any references to datasets used for training or evaluation. The introduction mentions various combinatorial optimization problems but does not specify datasets.

Moving on to the **methods section**, I will look for any subsections that describe the datasets used for training the graph neural network. The authors mention training on "five different types of random graphs" and "real-world graphs," but I need to find specific dataset names or references.

In the **results section**, the authors discuss their experiments and performance on various problems, including the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) and Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP). They mention testing on "real-world graphs from TSPLIB," which is a significant clue that I should investigate further.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper refers to "real-world graphs from TSPLIB," which is a well-known library for TSP instances. I will look for the citation for TSPLIB.

The citation for TSPLIB is:
> Gerhard Reinelt. *TSPLIB: Library of sample instances for the TSP*, 2020.

Additionally, the authors mention training on various types of random graphs, but they do not provide specific citations for these datasets. Since these are commonly used types of graphs in the literature, I will note that they are based on established models (e.g., Erdős-Rényi, Barabási-Albert) but will not provide specific citations as they are not explicitly mentioned in the paper.

Finally, I will summarize the findings:
1. **Real-world graphs from TSPLIB**: 
   - Citation: Gerhard Reinelt. *TSPLIB: Library of sample instances for the TSP*, 2020.

I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing.
