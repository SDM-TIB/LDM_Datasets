To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Boundary-aware Information Maximization for Self-supervised Medical Image Segmentation" by Jizong Peng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors conducted experiments on "two benchmark medical segmentation datasets," which indicates that datasets are indeed involved.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experimental setup** section, particularly in **section 3** where the authors describe their experimental setup. Here, they explicitly mention two datasets:

1. **ACDC Dataset**: The authors describe it as consisting of 200 short-axis cine-MRI scans from 100 patients, with specific annotations for various cardiac structures. This dataset is crucial for their experiments.

2. **PROMISE12 Dataset**: This dataset is described as focusing on prostate segmentation, comprising multi-centric transversal T2-weighted MR images from 50 subjects. It is also used in their experiments.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For the **ACDC Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Bernard, O., et al. "Deep learning techniques for automatic MRI cardiac multi-structures segmentation and diagnosis: Is the problem solved?" *IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging*, 37(11):2514–2525, Nov 2018. doi: 10.1109/TMI.2018.2837502.

- For the **PROMISE12 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Litjens, G., et al. "Evaluation of prostate segmentation algorithms for MRI: the PROMISE12 challenge." *Medical Image Analysis*, 18(2):359–373, 2014. doi: 10.1016/j.media.2013.12.002.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets and their citations clearly, ensuring that I have captured all necessary details for future reference or processing.
