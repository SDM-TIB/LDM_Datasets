To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-View Dreaming: Multi-View World Model with Contrastive Learning" by Akira Kinose et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the proposed method and its applications but does not specify any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine **section IV (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the experimental setup and the datasets used. In this section, they mention using environments from the **DeepMind Control Suite** and **Robosuite** for their experiments. This indicates that these environments are the datasets they utilized for testing their proposed methods.

I will then look for specific details about these datasets. The authors describe the tasks they performed, such as the **Blind Reacher**, **Dual View Pendulum**, and **Robosuite Lift** tasks. However, they do not provide specific dataset citations for these environments within the text. Therefore, I will need to refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned.

For the **DeepMind Control Suite**, the citation is:
> Tassa, Y., Doron, Y., Muldal, A., Erez, T., Li, Y., et al. (2018). *DeepMind Control Suite*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1801.00690.

For **Robosuite**, the citation is:
> Zhu, Y., Wong, J., Mandlekar, A., & Martín-Martín, R. (2020). *Robosuite: A modular simulation framework and benchmark for robot learning*. arXiv:2009.12293.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and future reference.

In summary, the datasets extracted from the paper are:
1. **DeepMind Control Suite** - Citation: Tassa et al. (2018).
2. **Robosuite** - Citation: Zhu et al. (2020).

I will ensure that these citations are accurately recorded for any further processing or documentation.
