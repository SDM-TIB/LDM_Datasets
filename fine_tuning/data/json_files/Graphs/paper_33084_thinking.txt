To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Graph Neural Networks for Topological Feature Extraction in ECG Classification" by Kamyar Zeinalipour and Marco Gori, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors tested their techniques on the **PTB Diagnostics dataset**, which is a strong indication that this dataset is crucial for their research.

Next, I will look into the **methodology** and **experiment** sections, as these typically provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used. In the **experiment section**, the authors specifically mention using the **PTB Diagnostic ECG database** as a data source for labeled ECG recordings. They describe the dataset's characteristics, such as the number of individuals involved and the types of diagnoses included.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the **PTB Diagnostics dataset**. The relevant citation is:

- **PTB Diagnostic ECG Database**:
  > Goldberger, A.L., Amaral, L.A., Glass, L., Hausdorff, J.M., Ivanov, P.C., Mark, R.G., Mietus, J.E., Moody, G.B., Peng, C.K., Stanley, H.E. "PhysioBank, PhysioToolkit, and PhysioNet: Components of a New Research Resource for Complex Physiologic Signals." *Circulation* 101(23), e215â€“e220 (2000).

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets, I will conclude that the **PTB Diagnostics dataset** is the primary dataset used in this research.

Finally, I will compile the extracted dataset information, ensuring that I include the full citation as required. This will allow for proper referencing and acknowledgment of the dataset used in the study.
