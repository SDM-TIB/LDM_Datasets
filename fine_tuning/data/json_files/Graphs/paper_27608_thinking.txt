To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Contrastive Learning Improves Model Robustness Under Label Noise" by Aritra Ghosh and Andrew Lan, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview, but I will focus on the sections that typically contain detailed information about datasets.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of label noise and the methods they propose. However, they do not explicitly mention datasets here. I will move on to the **methodology** section, where they describe their approach and any datasets used for training and evaluation.

In the **experimental results section**, the authors mention three datasets: **CIFAR-10**, **CIFAR-100**, and **Clothing1M**. I will extract details about each dataset:

1. **CIFAR-10**: This dataset contains 50,000 training samples and 10,000 test samples. The authors introduce synthetic label noise in the training samples. The dataset is widely used for image classification tasks.

2. **CIFAR-100**: Similar to CIFAR-10, this dataset also contains 50,000 training samples and 10,000 test samples, but it has 100 classes instead of 10. The authors apply both symmetric and asymmetric noise to the labels.

3. **Clothing1M**: This is a real-world dataset consisting of 1 million training samples, with labels generated from surrounding text on an online shopping website. The dataset contains approximately 38% noisy samples.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **CIFAR-10** and **CIFAR-100**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical Report, 2009.

- For **Clothing1M**, the citation is:
  > Tong Xiao, Tian Xia, Yi Yang, Chang Huang, and Xiaogang Wang. *Learning from Massive Noisy Labeled Data for Image Classification*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 2691â€“2699, 2015.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will prepare to compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
