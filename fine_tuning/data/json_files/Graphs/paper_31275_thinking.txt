To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Hulk: Graph Neural Networks for Optimizing Regionally Distributed Computing Systems" by Zhengqing Yuan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions an "open source collection of unlabeled data" available at a GitHub link, which indicates that there is at least one dataset involved.

Next, I will examine the **experimentation and evaluation section** to see if the authors provide more details about the datasets used in their experiments. In this section, they mention using "networkx" to build graph structure data, but I need to look for specific datasets or data sources that were utilized in their experiments.

I will also check the **data building section** to see if the authors describe how they constructed their datasets. They mention using "networkx" to build graph structure data, but I need to clarify if this is a dataset or a tool used to manipulate data.

In the **references section**, I will look for any citations that might refer to datasets or data sources. The authors may have cited foundational datasets or tools that are relevant to their work.

After reviewing these sections, I will compile the information I find about the datasets. If the paper explicitly mentions datasets with specific names, I will note those down along with their descriptions. If the paper refers to datasets indirectly or uses tools to create datasets, I will document that as well.

Finally, I will ensure to retrieve full citations for any datasets mentioned in the paper. If the authors reference existing datasets, I will look for the original papers or sources that describe those datasets to provide accurate citations.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will summarize the datasets, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that I adhere to the required format for clarity and completeness.
