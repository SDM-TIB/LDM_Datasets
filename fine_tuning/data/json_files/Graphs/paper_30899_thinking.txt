To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Exploring Fake News Detection with Heterogeneous Social Media Context Graphs" by Gregor Donabauer and Udo Kruschwitz, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that the authors achieved robust results on a common benchmark dataset, which suggests that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 3.1 (Dataset and Graph Construction Method)**, where the authors explicitly state that they adopt the **FakeNewsNet** dataset, which consists of two different datasets: **Politifact** and **GossipCop**. This section provides crucial details about the datasets, including their domains and the number of graphs constructed from them.

The authors describe the **FakeNewsNet** dataset as follows:
- **FakeNewsNet**: A dataset that includes two subsets: **Politifact** (for political news) and **GossipCop** (for entertainment stories). The paper mentions that they recrawled the data, which may differ slightly from previous uses.

In the same section, they provide specific numbers regarding the datasets:
- **Politifact**: 483 graphs (235 real, 248 fake).
- **GossipCop**: 12,214 graphs (10,067 real, 2,147 fake).
- **Full FakeNewsNet**: 12,697 graphs (10,302 real, 2,395 fake).

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **FakeNewsNet**, the citation is:
  > Shu, K., Mahudeswaran, D., Wang, S., Lee, D., Liu, H. (2020). *FakeNewsNet: A data repository with news content, social context, and spatiotemporal information for studying fake news on social media*. Big Data, 8(3), 171â€“188. https://doi.org/10.1089/big.2020.0062

- For **Politifact**, the citation is:
  > Politifact. (n.d.). *PolitiFact: A project of the Poynter Institute*. Retrieved from https://www.politifact.com/

- For **GossipCop**, the citation is:
  > GossipCop. (n.d.). *Gossip Cop: Fact-checking celebrity news*. Retrieved from https://www.gossipcop.com/

With this information, I can now summarize the datasets extracted from the paper, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.
