To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CYBORGS: Contrastively Bootstrapping Object Representations by Grounding in Segmentation" by Renhao Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the framework's evaluation on complex scene images, which suggests that datasets are involved, but I need to find specific names.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Experimental Settings)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for pretraining. Here, they state that they pretrain on the **MS COCO dataset**, which is a well-known dataset for object detection and segmentation tasks. The authors describe it as containing approximately 118,000 images of natural settings, making it suitable for their experiments.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the MS COCO dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Lin, T.Y., Maire, M., Belongie, S., Hays, J., Perona, P., Ramanan, D., Dollar, P., Zitnick, C.L. *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. In European Conference on Computer Vision, pp. 740â€“755, 2014.

Since the paper primarily discusses the MS COCO dataset, I will ensure to include this dataset in my final output.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format, ensuring that the full citation is included for clarity and proper attribution.
