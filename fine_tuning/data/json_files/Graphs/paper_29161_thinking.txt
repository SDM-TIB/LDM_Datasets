To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Contrastive Learning of Sociopragmatic Meaning in Social Media" by Chiyu Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their method on **24 SM datasets**, which suggests that there are multiple datasets to extract.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used. In this paper, the authors mention using **16 English language Twitter datasets** for various sociopragmatic tasks, including emotion recognition, hate speech detection, and sarcasm detection. I will list these datasets and their specific tasks as I find them.

I will also look for any **out-of-domain datasets** mentioned in the paper. The authors refer to eight datasets from different sources, such as Reddit and movie reviews, which are used for tasks like emotion recognition and sarcasm detection. I will ensure to note these as well.

As I identify each dataset, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for future researchers who may want to use these datasets. 

For example, the paper mentions the **GoEmotions dataset** for emotion recognition, which I will cite as follows:
> Demszky, D., et al. (2020). *GoEmotions: A dataset of fine-grained emotions*. In Proceedings of the 58th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL), pages 4040â€“4054.

I will repeat this process for each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring that I capture the correct citation format and details for each one.

Finally, I will compile all the extracted datasets along with their citations into a structured format for easy reference. This will include the dataset name, a brief description of its contents, the tasks it is used for, and the full citation for each dataset.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document all relevant datasets from the research paper.
