To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An Investigation of Representation and Allocation Harms in Contrastive Learning" by Subha Maity et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors demonstrate representation harm on "image and text datasets," which indicates that there are specific datasets used in their experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section** where the authors describe their experiments. In the section discussing the controlled study of class underrepresentation, they explicitly mention the following datasets:

1. **CIFAR10**: This is a well-known visual benchmark dataset that contains 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. The authors use this dataset to simulate underrepresentation by subsampling one of the classes.

2. **BIASBIOS**: This dataset consists of approximately 400,000 online biographies extracted from Common Crawl data, representing 28 occupations with varying frequencies and gender distributions. The authors use this dataset to analyze representation harm in text data.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **CIFAR10**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton, et al. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009.

- For **BIASBIOS**, the citation is:
  > Maria De-Arteaga, Alexey Romanov, Hanna Wallach, Jennifer Chayes, Christian Borgs, Alexandra Chouldechova, Sahin Geyik, Krishnaram Kenthapadi, and Adam Tauman Kalai. *Bias in Bios: A Case Study of Semantic Representation Bias in a High-Stakes Setting*. In Proceedings of the Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency - FAT* ’19, pp. 120–128, 2019. doi:10.1145/3287560.3287572.

Now that I have the datasets and their citations, I will summarize the findings in a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
