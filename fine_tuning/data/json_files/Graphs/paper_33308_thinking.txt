To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Sparse but Strong: Crafting Adversarially Robust Graph Lottery Tickets" by Subhajit Dutta Chowdhury et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of the proposed method on various benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for any explicit mentions of datasets. The introduction provides context about the research and may reference specific datasets used in the experiments.

I will then look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any relevant subsections within the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. This is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments in detail. 

In the **experiments section**, the authors mention evaluating their method on four datasets: **Cora**, **Citeseer**, **PubMed**, and **OGBN-ArXiv**. Each dataset is described in terms of the number of nodes, edges, classes, and features, which provides a comprehensive overview of their characteristics.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

1. **Cora Dataset**:
   > McCallum, A. K., Nigam, K., Rennie, J., & Seymore, K. (2000). Automating the construction of internet portals with machine learning. *Information Retrieval*, 3(2), 127-163.

2. **Citeseer Dataset**:
   > Sen, P., Namata, G., Bilgic, M., Getoor, L., Galligher, J., & Eliassi-Rad, T. (2008). Collective classification in network data. *AI Magazine*, 29(3), 93-93.

3. **PubMed Dataset**:
   > Zhang, M., & Chen, Y. (2018). Link prediction based on graph neural networks. In *Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems* (Vol. 31).

4. **OGBN-ArXiv Dataset**:
   > Hu, W., Fey, M., Zitnik, M., Dong, Y., Ren, H., Liu, B., Catasta, M., & Leskovec, J. (2020). Open graph benchmark: Datasets for machine learning on graphs. In *Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems* (Vol. 33).

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
