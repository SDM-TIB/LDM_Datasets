To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Joint Detection and Localization of Stealth False Data Injection Attacks in Smart Grids using Graph Neural Networks" by Osman Boyaci et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and it may mention datasets used for simulations or experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly where the authors describe their approach to generating datasets. In this paper, the authors mention generating datasets for IEEE test systems with 1-minute intervals using various false data injection attack (FDIA) generation algorithms. This indicates that there are specific datasets created for their experiments.

I will look for specific details about the datasets in the **experiments section**. The authors describe how they generated a dataset for each test system (IEEE 57, 118, and 300-bus systems) using historical load profiles and FDIA generation algorithms. They also mention the number of samples and the structure of the datasets, which is crucial for understanding their content.

In the **results section**, the authors may refer to the datasets again when discussing the performance of their model, confirming their relevance and usage in the experiments.

Now, I will compile the full citations for the datasets mentioned in the paper. The authors refer to the following datasets:

1. **IEEE 57-bus test system dataset**: This dataset is generated using historical load profiles and FDIA generation algorithms. The specific citation for the IEEE 57-bus test system is:
   > "IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting, 2014."

2. **IEEE 118-bus test system dataset**: Similar to the 57-bus system, this dataset is also generated using historical load profiles and FDIA generation algorithms. The citation for the IEEE 118-bus test system is:
   > "IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting, 2014."

3. **IEEE 300-bus test system dataset**: This dataset follows the same generation process as the previous ones. The citation for the IEEE 300-bus test system is:
   > "IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting, 2014."

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets and their citations in a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly identified along with its corresponding citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
