To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Toward Autonomous Cooperation in Heterogeneous Nanosatellite Constellations Using Dynamic Graph Neural Networks" by G. Casadesus Vilaa et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, results, and conclusion sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or data sources.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to see if the authors reference any datasets used for their experiments or simulations. This section often contains background information that may include dataset names or descriptions.

In the **methodology section**, I will look for details about the experiments conducted, including any datasets used for training or testing the proposed dynamic graph neural network (DGNN) model. The authors may describe the nature of the data, such as whether it is synthetic or real-world data, and any specific characteristics of the datasets.

I will also check the **results section** to see if the authors discuss the datasets in the context of their findings. They may provide insights into how the datasets influenced their results or any performance metrics related to the datasets.

Finally, I will consult the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned in the paper. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

If the authors mention synthetic data, I will note that it may not have a formal citation but will describe its generation process if provided. If real datasets are mentioned, I will ensure to extract their full citations accurately.

Once I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and future reference.
