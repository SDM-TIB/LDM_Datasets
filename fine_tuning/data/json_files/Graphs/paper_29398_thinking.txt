To extract datasets from the research paper titled "3D Pride Without 2D Prejudice: Bias-Controlled Multi-Level Generative Models for Structure-Based Ligand Design" by Lucian Chan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the use of "large data resources available for 2D generative modelling with datasets of ligand-protein complexes," indicating that datasets are indeed involved.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, where the authors describe the datasets used for training their models. They specifically mention two datasets:

1. **Enamine REAL Diverse Drug-Like Set (ERD3)**: This dataset consists of 25 million drug-like compounds, which are used to derive the 1D frequencies and the 2D model. The authors note that this dataset is constructed to ensure diversity among the compounds.

2. **Binding MOAD (Mother of All Databases)**: This dataset includes 38,702 ligand-protein complexes, which are biologically relevant ligands. The authors mention that this dataset is used for constructing the domain-recalibrated 2D model and the 3D model.

In the **results section**, the authors discuss the performance of their models based on these datasets, confirming their significance in the study.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the references section of the paper:

- For the **Enamine REAL Diverse Drug-Like Set (ERD3)**, the citation is:
  > Enamine REAL Compounds. https://enamine.net/compound-libraries (2020).

- For the **Binding MOAD**, the citation is:
  > Hu, L., Benson, M. L., Smith, R. D., Lerner, M. G., & Carlson, H. A. Binding MOAD (Mother of All Databases). Proteins: Structure, Function, and Bioinformatics, 60, 333â€“340 (2005). https://doi.org/10.1002/prot.20512.

After collecting this information, I will summarize the datasets in a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
