To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DeepGate: Learning Neural Representations of Logic Gates" by Min Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the work, but I will focus on sections that typically contain detailed information about datasets.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges in electronic design automation (EDA) and the need for effective circuit representation learning. However, they do not explicitly mention datasets here.

Next, I will examine **section IV (Experiments)**, where the authors describe their experimental setup. They mention extracting sub-circuits from four benchmark circuit suites: **ITC’99**, **IWLS’05**, **EPFL**, and **OpenCore**. This section provides crucial information about the datasets used in their experiments.

The authors also provide a table (Table I) summarizing the statistics of the circuit dataset, including the number of sub-circuits extracted from each benchmark. This confirms that these benchmarks are indeed the datasets utilized in their research.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

1. **ITC’99 Benchmark**:
   > C. Albrecht, “IWLS 2005 benchmarks,” in IWLS, 2005.

2. **IWLS’05 Benchmark**:
   > C. Albrecht, “IWLS 2005 benchmarks,” in IWLS, 2005.

3. **EPFL Benchmark**:
   > L. Amarú, P.-E. Gaillardon, and G. De Micheli, “The EPFL combinational benchmark suite,” in IWLS, no. CONF, 2015.

4. **OpenCore Benchmark**:
   > O. Team, “Opencores,” https://opencores.org/.

With this information, I can now summarize the datasets extracted from the paper, ensuring to include the full citations for each.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for clarity and future reference.
