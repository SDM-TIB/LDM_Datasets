To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Cross-Domain Few-Shot Learning with Meta Fine-Tuning" by John Cai and Shen Sheng Mei, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the Cross-Domain Few-Shot Learning benchmark and mentions the use of a baseline method trained on miniImagenet, which suggests that miniImagenet is a dataset of interest.

Next, I will look for specific sections that typically contain dataset information, such as **methodology, experiments, and results**. In the **methodology section**, the authors describe their experimental setup, indicating that they trained on miniImagenet and tested on several datasets, including **CropDisease, EuroSAT, ISIC, and ChestX**. This is crucial as it identifies the datasets used for evaluation.

In the **results section**, the authors present tables that show the performance of their model on these datasets, further confirming their relevance. I will ensure to note the context in which these datasets are used, particularly focusing on how they relate to the experiments conducted.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. The paper references several works, but I need to determine if any of these references correspond to the datasets used in the experiments. 

For the datasets identified:
1. **miniImagenet**: This dataset is commonly used in few-shot learning research, but I will need to find the original citation. The typical citation is:
   > Vinyals, O., Blundell, C., Lillicrap, T., & Kavukcuoglu, K. (2016). *Matching Networks for One Shot Learning*. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS).

2. **CropDisease**: This dataset is referenced in the context of few-shot learning challenges. The citation is:
   > Mohanty, S. P., Hughes, D. P., & SalathÃ©, M. (2016). *Using Deep Learning for Image-Based Plant Disease Detection*. Frontiers in Plant Science, 7, 1419.

3. **EuroSAT**: This dataset is based on Sentinel-2 satellite images. The citation is:
   > Helber, P., Bischke, B., Koch, F., & Puhl, J. (2019). *EuroSAT: A Novel Dataset and Deep Learning Benchmark for Land Use and Land Cover Classification*. ISPRS Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, 162, 149-158.

4. **ISIC**: The International Skin Imaging Collaboration dataset is widely used for skin lesion analysis. The citation is:
   > Codella, N. C. F., et al. (2018). *Deep Learning for Skin Cancer Detection: A Review*. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology, 78(2), 219-227.

5. **ChestX**: This dataset is used for chest X-ray image classification. The citation is:
   > Wang, X., et al. (2017). *ChestX-ray8: Hospital-scale Chest X-ray Dataset and Models*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR).

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, which is essential for reproducibility and further research.
