To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Underwater-art: Expanding information perspectives with text templates for underwater acoustic target recognition" by Yuan Xie et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of underwater acoustic target recognition and mention the need for sufficient data. This suggests that datasets are crucial for their experiments, but I need to find specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly **section 3 (Experiment Setup)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they describe two datasets:

1. **Shipsear**: This dataset consists of underwater recordings of ship and boat sounds, comprising 90 records (nearly 3 hours) representing sounds from 11 vessel types. The authors note that it includes relevant information such as sound source distance, channel depth, location, and wind speed.

2. **DeepShip**: This is an underwater acoustic benchmark dataset containing 47 hours and 4 minutes of real-world underwater recordings of 265 different ships belonging to four classes (cargo, passenger ship, tanker, and tug). The authors clarify that DeepShip only has category labels and that there is no overlap between the vessel types in DeepShip and Shipsear.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **Shipsear**, the citation is:
  > Santos-Domínguez, D., Torres-Guijarro, S., Cardenal-López, A., & Pena-Gimenez, A. (2016). Shipsear: An underwater vessel noise database. *Applied Acoustics*, 113, 64–69.

- For **DeepShip**, the citation is:
  > Irfan, M., Jiangbin, Z., Ali, S., Iqbal, M., Masood, Z., & Hamid, U. (2021). Deepship: An underwater acoustic benchmark dataset and a separable convolution based autoencoder for classification. *Expert Systems with Applications*, 183, 115270.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
