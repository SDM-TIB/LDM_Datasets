To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SoftMCL: Soft Momentum Contrastive Learning for Fine-grained Sentiment-aware Pre-training" by Jin Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that extensive experiments were conducted on four different sentiment-related tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4), where the authors provide details about the datasets used. In this section, they mention several datasets along with their statistics, including training, validation, and test splits. The datasets listed are:

1. **Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST-2)**: Contains 8,544 training samples, 1,101 validation samples, and 2,210 test samples.
2. **Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST-5)**: Contains 6,920 training samples, 872 validation samples, and 1,821 test samples.
3. **Movie Review (MR)**: Contains 8,534 training samples, 1,078 validation samples, and 1,050 test samples.
4. **Customer Review (CR)**: Contains 2,025 training samples, 675 validation samples, and 675 test samples.
5. **IMDB**: Contains 22,500 training samples, 2,500 validation samples, and 25,000 test samples.
6. **Yelp-2**: Contains 504,000 training samples, 56,000 validation samples, and 38,000 test samples.
7. **Yelp-5**: Contains 594,000 training samples, 56,000 validation samples, and 50,000 test samples.
8. **Emobank**: Contains 6,195 training samples, 2,065 validation samples, and 2,065 test samples.
9. **Facebook**: Contains 1,736 training samples, 579 validation samples, and 579 test samples.
10. **Lap14 (Restaurant)**: Contains 3,452 training samples, 150 validation samples, and 676 test samples.
11. **Rest14 (Laptop)**: Contains 2,163 training samples, 150 validation samples, and 638 test samples.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their full citations into a structured format for further processing.
