To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Information Maximization for Extreme Pose Face Recognition" by Mohammad Saeed Ebrahimi Saadabadi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the effectiveness of the proposed model is investigated through extensive experiments on **four benchmark datasets**. This indicates that there are multiple datasets to look for.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, they mention that they conducted experiments on four datasets, which are likely to be detailed further.

Upon reviewing the **experiments section**, I find the following datasets explicitly mentioned:

1. **CMU Multi-PIE Dataset**: This dataset includes 750,000 images of 337 identities with variations in pose, illumination, and expression in a controlled environment. The authors specify that they use images with neutral expressions in 13 views for their experiments.

2. **Celebrities in Frontal-Profile in the Wild (CFP)**: This dataset consists of facial images of 500 different identities, with 10 frontal and 4 profile samples per identity. The authors evaluate their method on this dataset using a 10-fold protocol.

3. **IJB-B Dataset**: This dataset is known for its challenging conditions in the wild, containing large pose variations and diversity in resolutions. The authors follow a specific protocol for evaluation on this dataset.

4. **IJB-C Dataset**: An extension of IJB-B, this dataset also presents challenges for face recognition and is used for evaluating the proposed method.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each of these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for the datasets used in the research.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their full citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or processing. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets referenced in the paper along with their proper citations.
