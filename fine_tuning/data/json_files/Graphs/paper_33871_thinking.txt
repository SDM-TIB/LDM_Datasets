To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MMSR: Symbolic Regression is a Multimodal Task" by Yanjie Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on multiple mainstream datasets, which indicates that there are datasets to be identified.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for testing the performance of their model. In this section, they mention several datasets by name:

1. **Nguyen Dataset**: This dataset is used for symbolic regression tasks and is referenced multiple times throughout the paper.
2. **Keijzer Dataset**: Another dataset utilized for evaluating the performance of the proposed method.
3. **Korns Dataset**: This dataset is also mentioned as part of the experiments.
4. **Constant Dataset**: Used in the context of symbolic regression.
5. **Livermore Dataset**: Included in the experiments to assess the model's performance.
6. **Vladislavleva Dataset**: Another dataset referenced in the context of symbolic regression.
7. **R Dataset**: This dataset is mentioned as part of the evaluation.
8. **Jin Dataset**: Included in the experiments.
9. **Neat Dataset**: Another dataset used for testing.
10. **Others Dataset**: A collective term for additional datasets used in the experiments.
11. **Feynman Dataset**: Specifically mentioned as part of the AI Feynman dataset used for testing.
12. **Strogatz Dataset**: Also referenced in the context of the experiments.
13. **Black-box Dataset**: Mentioned as part of the evaluation.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access these datasets.

The citations I will look for include:

- For the **Nguyen Dataset**, I will find the original source or paper that introduced it.
- The same process will be applied to the **Keijzer**, **Korns**, **Constant**, **Livermore**, **Vladislavleva**, **R**, **Jin**, **Neat**, **Others**, **Feynman**, **Strogatz**, and **Black-box** datasets.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset names along with their full citations into a structured format for clarity and ease of reference.

By following this methodical approach, I will ensure that I accurately extract and cite all datasets mentioned in the paper, providing a comprehensive overview of the resources utilized in the research.
