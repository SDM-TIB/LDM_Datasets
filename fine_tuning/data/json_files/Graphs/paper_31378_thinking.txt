To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Graph Neural Network Contextual Embedding for Deep Learning on Tabular Data" by Mario Villaizán-Vallelado et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors compare their model against results from five public datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they mention five datasets:

1. **HELOC**: This dataset consists of anonymized credit applications for Home Equity Lines of Credit (HELOC). It contains 21 numerical and 2 categorical features, and the task is a binary classification to predict timely payments over a two-year period.

2. **California Housing**: This dataset includes information about houses in a California district based on 1990 census data. It is used for a regression task to forecast property prices.

3. **Adult Incoming**: This dataset contains personal details such as age, gender, and education level, and is used to predict whether an individual earns more or less than $50,000 per year.

4. **Forest Cover Type**: This dataset includes cartographic variables to predict the forest cover type, which is a multi-class classification task with seven classes.

5. **HIGGS**: This dataset contains 11 million rows and 28 features, where the first 21 are kinematic properties measured by particle detectors. The task is a binary classification to distinguish between signals with Higgs bosons and background processes.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- **HELOC**:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
