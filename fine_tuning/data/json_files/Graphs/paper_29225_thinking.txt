To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An Exploratory Study of Stock Price Movements from Earnings Calls" by Sourav Medya et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the datasets referenced. The abstract mentions that the study covers approximately 100,000 transcripts of earnings calls from 6,300 public companies, which indicates that there is a significant dataset involved.

Next, I will look into **section 3 (Data)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used in their study. Here, they mention three datasets:

1. **Earnings Call Transcripts**: The authors collected transcripts available online, totaling 152,483 transcripts, with 97,478 containing complete data. This dataset spans earnings calls from January 2010 to December 2019 and includes relevant information such as company names, ticker symbols, transcript release dates, industrial sectors, and quarters of earnings.

2. **Earnings per Share (EPS) and Sales Estimates**: This dataset is sourced from the Zacks investment dataset obtained via Wharton Research Data Services (WRDS). It includes actual and estimated sales and EPS figures, which are critical for the analysis of stock price movements.

3. **Analysts’ Recommendations**: The authors also mention that they analyze recommendations from analysts, which are important for understanding market reactions to earnings calls.

After identifying these datasets, I will proceed to the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. However, since the datasets are primarily derived from publicly available sources and the authors do not provide specific citations for the earnings call transcripts, I will note that the transcripts are sourced from platforms like Seeking Alpha. For the Zacks dataset, I will include the citation for Zacks investment:

- **Zacks Investment Dataset**: 
  > Zacks Investment Research. *Zacks Investment Data*. Available at: https://www.zacks.com/

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citations for the datasets as required.

In summary, the datasets extracted from the paper are:
1. **Earnings Call Transcripts**: Approximately 100,000 transcripts from 6,300 public companies (source: Seeking Alpha).
2. **Earnings per Share (EPS) and Sales Estimates**: Zacks investment dataset obtained via WRDS.
3. **Analysts’ Recommendations**: Data analyzed from various sources, not specifically cited.

This structured approach ensures that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.
