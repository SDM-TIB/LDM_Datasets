To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Adaptive Stacked Graph Filter" by Hoang NT et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study but may not contain detailed dataset information. The introduction may mention the context of the datasets used, while the experimental results section is likely to provide specific details about the datasets employed in the experiments.

In **section 6 (Experimental Results)**, the authors mention three groups of datasets corresponding to different types of label frequency. They specifically list the datasets used for their experiments:

1. **Cora**: A citation network dataset with 2,708 vertices and 5,278 edges, used for low-frequency labeled data.
2. **Citeseer**: Another citation network dataset with 3,327 vertices and 4,676 edges, also used for low-frequency labeled data.
3. **Pubmed**: A citation network dataset with 19,717 vertices and 44,327 edges, used for low-frequency labeled data.
4. **Amazon-Photo**: A co-purchase network dataset with 7,487 vertices and 119,043 edges, used for low-frequency labeled data.
5. **Amazon-Computer**: Another co-purchase network dataset with 13,381 vertices and 245,778 edges, used for low-frequency labeled data.
6. **Wisconsin**: A dataset from the WebKB collection with 251 vertices and 450 edges, used for midrange label frequency.
7. **Cornell**: Another dataset from the WebKB collection with 183 vertices and 277 edges, used for midrange label frequency.
8. **Texas**: Another dataset from the WebKB collection with 183 vertices and 279 edges, used for midrange label frequency.
9. **Chameleon**: A dataset with 2,277 vertices and 31,371 edges, used for midrange label frequency.
10. **Bipartite**: A synthetic dataset generated with 2,000 vertices (1,000 on each part) and 50,182 edges, used for high label frequency.

Next, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets mentioned in the paper are as follows:

- **Cora, Citeseer, Pubmed**:

- **Amazon-Photo, Amazon-Computer**:

- **Chameleon**:
  > Rozemberczki, B., Allen, C., & Sarkar, R. (2019). Multi-scale attributed node embedding. *arXiv preprint arXiv:1909.13021*.

For the **Bipartite dataset**, since it is synthetic and generated by the authors, it may not have a formal citation but can be described as follows:
> Synthetic dataset generated using NetworkX library, labeled by its bipartite parts.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations into a structured format for further processing.
