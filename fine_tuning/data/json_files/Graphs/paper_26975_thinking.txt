To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Supervised Contrastive Learning for Pre-trained Language Model Fine-tuning" by Beliz Gunel et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their method on multiple datasets from the GLUE benchmark, which indicates that there are specific datasets to look for.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets and Training Details)**, where the authors provide a summary of the datasets used for evaluation. This section typically contains the most detailed information about each dataset, including their tasks, domains, number of training examples, and number of classes.

In this section, I will identify the following datasets mentioned:

1. **SST-2**: A sentiment analysis dataset with 67,000 training examples and 2 classes.
2. **CoLA**: A dataset for grammatical correctness with 8,500 training examples and 2 classes.
3. **MRPC**: A paraphrase dataset with 3,700 training examples and 2 classes.
4. **RTE**: A textual entailment dataset with 2,500 training examples and 2 classes.
5. **QNLI**: A question answering/textual entailment dataset with 105,000 training examples and 2 classes.
6. **MNLI**: A multi-domain textual entailment dataset with 393,000 training examples and 3 classes.

After identifying these datasets, I will then check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

- **SST-2**: 
  > Samuel R. Bowman, Gabor Angeli, Christopher Potts, and Christopher D. Manning. *A large annotated corpus for learning natural language inference*. In EMNLP, 2015.

- **CoLA**: 
  > Warstadt, Alex, et al. *Neural Network Acceptability Judgments*. In Proceedings of the 2019 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, Volume 1 (Long and Short Papers), 2019.

- **MRPC**: 
  > Dolgov, Dmitry, et al. *The Microsoft Research Paraphrase Corpus*. 2005.

- **RTE**: 
  > Dagan, Ido, et al. *The PASCAL Recognizing Textual Entailment Challenge*. In Proceedings of the PASCAL Challenges Workshop, 2005.

- **QNLI**: 
  > Wang, Alex, et al. *GLUE: A Multi-Task Benchmark and Analysis Platform for Natural Language Understanding*. In ICLR, 2019.

- **MNLI**: 
  > Williams, Adina, et al. *A Broad-Coverage Challenge Corpus for Sentence Understanding through Inference*. In Proceedings of the 2018 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, 2018.

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this into a structured format for further processing or review.
