To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Model-Advantage and Value-Aware Models for Model-Based Reinforcement Learning: Bridging the Gap in Theory and Practice" by Nirbhay Modhe et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the practical viability of value-aware model learning in continuous control tasks, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (section 5) closely, as this is where datasets are typically detailed. In this section, the authors describe their experiments on various continuous control tasks using two dyna-style model-based reinforcement learning algorithms: SLBO and MBPO. They mention using environments such as MuJoCo and OpenAI Gym, which are commonly used benchmarks in reinforcement learning research.

I will also check the **references section** to find any specific datasets that might have been used in the experiments. The authors refer to several environments, including:

1. **MuJoCo**: A physics engine for model-based control, which is widely used for continuous control tasks.
   - Citation: 
     > Todorov, E., Erez, T., & Tassa, Y. (2012). Mujoco: A physics engine for model-based control. In 2012 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (pp. 5026–5033). IEEE.

2. **OpenAI Gym**: A toolkit for developing and comparing reinforcement learning algorithms, which includes various environments for testing.
   - Citation:
     > Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L., Schneider, J., Schulman, J., Tang, J., & Zaremba, W. (2016). OpenAI gym. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01540.

In the experiments, the authors mention specific environments such as **Pendulum**, **Acrobot**, **Swimmer**, **Hopper**, and **Walker**, which are part of the OpenAI Gym suite. However, they do not provide specific dataset citations for these environments since they are standard benchmarks.

Now, I will compile the information about the datasets and their citations:

1. **MuJoCo**:
   - Citation: 
     > Todorov, E., Erez, T., & Tassa, Y. (2012). Mujoco: A physics engine for model-based control. In 2012 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (pp. 5026–5033). IEEE.

2. **OpenAI Gym**:
   - Citation:
     > Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L., Schneider, J., Schulman, J., Tang, J., & Zaremba, W. (2016). OpenAI gym. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01540.

3. **Pendulum** (part of OpenAI Gym):
   - No specific citation needed; it is a standard environment.

4. **Acrobot** (part of OpenAI Gym):
   - No specific citation needed; it is a standard environment.

5. **Swimmer** (part of OpenAI Gym):
   - No specific citation needed; it is a standard environment.

6. **Hopper** (part of OpenAI Gym):
   - No specific citation needed; it is a standard environment.

7. **Walker** (part of OpenAI Gym):
   - No specific citation needed; it is a standard environment.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for review or further processing, ensuring that I include the full citations for the datasets mentioned in the paper.
