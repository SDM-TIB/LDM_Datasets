To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Intent Contrastive Learning with Cross Subsequences for Sequential Recommendation" by Xiuyuan Qin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that extensive experiments were conducted on four real-world datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed present in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors describe their experimental setup. In this section, they explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. I will look for a subsection that discusses the datasets in detail, which is typically labeled as "Datasets" or something similar.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention four datasets:

1. **Sports Dataset**: This dataset consists of user interactions related to sports products. The statistics provided include:
   - Number of Users: 35,598
   - Number of Items: 18,357
   - Number of Actions: 296,337
   - Average Actions/User: 8.3
   - Average Actions/Item: 16.1
   - Sparsity: 99.95%

2. **Beauty Dataset**: This dataset contains user interactions for beauty products. The statistics are:
   - Number of Users: 22,363
   - Number of Items: 12,101
   - Number of Actions: 198,502
   - Average Actions/User: 8.8
   - Average Actions/Item: 16.4
   - Sparsity: 99.93%

3. **Toys Dataset**: This dataset includes interactions related to toys. The statistics are:
   - Number of Users: 6,040
   - Number of Items: 19,412
   - Number of Actions: 999,611
   - Average Actions/User: 165.4
   - Average Actions/Item: 8.6
   - Sparsity: 95.16%

4. **MovieLens-1M Dataset (ML-1M)**: This dataset contains user ratings for movies. The statistics are:
   - Number of Users: 6,040
   - Number of Items: 3,416
   - Number of Actions: 1,000,000
   - Average Actions/User: 165.4
   - Average Actions/Item: 292.6
   - Sparsity: 99.93%

Next, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for these datasets. The authors typically cite the original sources of the datasets they used. 

For the datasets mentioned, I will look for the following citations:

- **Sports Dataset**: The citation may refer to the original source of the dataset, which could be a publicly available dataset or a specific research paper.
- **Beauty Dataset**: Similar to the Sports Dataset, I will look for the original source.
- **Toys Dataset**: I will find the citation that corresponds to this dataset.
- **MovieLens-1M Dataset**: The citation for this dataset is well-known and can be referenced as:
  > F. Maxwell Harper and Joseph A. Konstan. *The MovieLens Datasets: History and Context*. ACM Transactions on Interactive Intelligent Systems, 5(4):19, 2015. 

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described with its statistics and accompanied by the appropriate citations. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details or citations related to the datasets used in the research.
