To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Normal-guided Garment UV Prediction for Human Re-texturing" by Yasamin Jafarian et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors demonstrate their method on both real and synthetic data, which suggests that there are datasets involved. I will look for specific names or descriptions of these datasets.

Next, I will check the **evaluation** section, as it typically contains detailed information about the datasets used for testing the proposed methods. In this section, the authors explicitly list the datasets they evaluated their method on:

1. **Synthetic Video Sequences**: The authors mention using five synthetic video sequences of simulated dress and T-shirt garments from Santesteban et al. (2021), which includes random texture patterns over 700 frames.

2. **Fashion Video Dataset**: They also refer to ten real videos from the Fashion Video dataset, which is a common dataset in the field of fashion and garment analysis.

3. **TikTok Dataset**: The authors mention using the TikTok dataset, which consists of various videos from the platform.

4. **YouTube Videos and Internet Images**: Additionally, they state that they used various YouTube videos and in-the-wild internet images for their experiments.

Now, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Synthetic Video Sequences**, the citation is:
  > Igor Santesteban, Nils Thuerey, Miguel A Otaduy, and Dan Casas. *Self-Supervised Collision Handling via Generative 3D Garment Models for Virtual Try-On*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2021.

- For the **Fashion Video Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Polina Zablotskaia, Aliaksandr Siarohin, Bo Zhao, and Leonid Sigal. *Dwnet: Dense warp-based network for pose-guided human video generation*. In British Machine Vision Conference (BMVC), 2019.

- For the **TikTok Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yasamin Jafarian and Hyun Soo Park. *Learning high fidelity depths of dressed humans by watching social media dance videos*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2021.

- For the **YouTube Videos and Internet Images**, there may not be a specific citation as these are often general sources, but I will note that they are used in the context of the experiments.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and that the full citations are included for reference. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
