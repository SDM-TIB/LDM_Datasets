To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Disentangling Learnable and Memorizable Data via Contrastive Learning for Semantic Communications" by Christina Chaccour and Walid Saad, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses a novel contrastive learning framework but does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine the **experiments and simulation results sections** to see if any datasets are referenced. In the **simulation results**, the authors mention that they consider "X to be the low-level binary equivalent of a mixture model of CIFAR-10 and ImageNet-10/Dogs." This indicates that these datasets are used in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. **CIFAR-10**: The citation for CIFAR-10 is:
   > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009.

2. **ImageNet**: The citation for ImageNet is:
   > Olga Russakovsky et al. *Imagenet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, vol. 115, no. 3, pp. 211â€“252, Apr. 2015.

Since the authors refer to a mixture model of CIFAR-10 and ImageNet-10/Dogs, I will ensure to include both datasets in my extraction.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
