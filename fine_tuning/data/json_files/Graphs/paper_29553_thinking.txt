To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Mobility, Communication and Computation Aware Federated Learning for Internet of Vehicles" by Md Ferdous Pervej et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to gather initial insights about any datasets that are referenced. The abstract mentions the use of **real-world vehicle trace datasets** for validation, which indicates that datasets are indeed involved.

Next, I will focus on the **simulation setting and dataset description section**. Here, the authors specifically mention the **Mobile Century Dataset**, which is collected by the Mobile Millennium project in 2008. This dataset is described as containing data collected for 77 vehicles with trajectory traces and specific features such as time, latitude, longitude, and speed.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the Mobile Century Dataset. The relevant citation is:

- **Mobile Century Dataset**: 
  > J. C. Herrera et al., “Evaluation of traffic data obtained via GPS-enabled mobile phones: The mobile century field experiment,” Transport. Research Part C: Emerg. Technol., vol. 18, no. 4, pp. 568–583, 2010.

After identifying the dataset and its citation, I will ensure that I have captured all relevant details about the dataset, including its purpose and the specific features it contains.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and full citation, ensuring that all necessary details are accurately represented for future reference or processing.
