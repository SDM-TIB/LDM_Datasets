To extract datasets from the research paper titled "HOEG: A New Approach for Object-Centric Predictive Process Monitoring" by Tim K. Smit, Hajo A. Reijers, and Xixi Lu, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and evaluation sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method using three Object-Centric Event Logs (OCELs), which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **evaluation section**. In this section, the authors provide a summary of the datasets used in their experiments, specifically in **Table 6**. The three datasets mentioned are:

1. **BPI17**: This dataset concerns a loan application process and contains 393,931 events and 22,367 objects. It has 3 object types and 4 attributes per object type.

2. **OTC (Order-to-Cash)**: This dataset is related to an order management process and includes 695,694 events and 74,504 objects. It has 2 object types and 3 attributes per object type.

3. **FI (Financial Institution)**: This dataset is extracted from a real-life workflow management system and contains 94,148 events and 31,509 objects. It has 3 object types and 14 attributes per object type.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **BPI17**, the citation is:
  > van Dongen, B.F. (2017). *BPI Challenge 2017*.

- For **OTC**, the citation is:
  > van der Aalst, W.M.P., Berti, A. (2020). *Discovering object-centric Petri nets*. Fundam. Informaticae, 175(1-4), 1–40.

- For **FI**, the citation is:
  > Pourbafrani, M., Kar, S., Kaiser, S., van der Aalst, W.M.P. (2021). *Remaining time prediction for processes with inter-case dynamics*. In: ICPM Workshops. Lecture Notes in Business Information Processing, vol. 433, pp. 140–153. Springer.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations. Each dataset will be described with its name, a brief description, and the full citation, ensuring that all necessary details are included for proper referencing.
