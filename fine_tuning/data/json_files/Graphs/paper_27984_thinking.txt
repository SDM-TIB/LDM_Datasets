To extract datasets from the research paper titled "PPGN: Physics-Preserved Graph Networks for Real-Time Fault Location in Distribution Systems with Limited Observation and Labels" by Wenting Li and Deepjyoti Deka, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors validate their method using the **IEEE 123-node and 37-node test feeders**, which suggests that these are the datasets used in their experiments.

Next, I will look for specific details about these datasets in the **experiments section**. The authors mention that they numerically validate their method in the **IEEE 123-node and 37-node test feeders**, confirming that these are indeed the datasets utilized for their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The IEEE test feeders are commonly referenced in the literature, so I will look for the original sources or authoritative papers that describe them.

1. **IEEE 123-node test feeder**: The citation is:
   > Kersting, W. H. (1991). Radial distribution test feeders. *IEEE Transactions on Power Systems*, 6(3), 975–985.

2. **IEEE 37-node test feeder**: The citation is:
   > Kersting, W. H. (1991). Radial distribution test feeders. *IEEE Transactions on Power Systems*, 6(3), 975–985.

Both datasets are referenced from the same foundational paper, which is common in the field.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.
