To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Hierarchical Few-Shot Object Detection: Problem, Benchmark and Method" by Yang Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the creation of a benchmark dataset called **HiFSOD-Bird**, which is a strong indicator that this is a key dataset in the paper. The introduction further elaborates on the dataset, stating it contains 176,350 wild-bird images across 1,432 categories organized into a hierarchical taxonomy.

Next, I will look into **section 4 (Benchmark)**, specifically **subsection 4.1 (Data Construction)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the **HiFSOD-Bird** dataset. Here, they describe the dataset's size, the number of categories, and the hierarchical structure, confirming its significance for the research.

In this section, the authors detail that the dataset includes:
- **176,350 images** of wild birds.
- **1,432 categories** organized into a 4-level taxonomy: 32 orders, 132 families, 572 genera, and 1,432 species.
- High-quality annotations for bounding boxes and class labels.

The authors also mention that the dataset is significant for monitoring and protecting endangered birds, which adds context to its importance.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the **HiFSOD-Bird** dataset. However, since this dataset is newly introduced in this paper, it may not have an external citation. Instead, I will use the citation of the paper itself as the authoritative source for the dataset.

The citation for the paper is:
> Lu Zhang, Yang Wang, Jiaogen Zhou, Chenbo Zhang, Yinglu Zhang, Jihong Guan, Yatao Bian, and Shuigeng Zhou. 2022. Hierarchical Few-Shot Object Detection: Problem, Benchmark and Method. In Proceedings of the 30th ACM International Conference on Multimedia (MM ’22), Oct. 10–14, 2022, Lisboa, Portugal. ACM, New York, NY, USA, 10 pages. https://doi.org/10.1145/3503161.3548412

Finally, I will compile the information about the dataset into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and the citation for the paper as the source of the dataset. This will ensure that I have accurately captured all necessary details for the **HiFSOD-Bird** dataset.
