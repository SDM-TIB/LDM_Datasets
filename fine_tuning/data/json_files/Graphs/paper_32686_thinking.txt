To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Replication: Contrastive Learning and Data Augmentation in Traffic Classification Using a Flowpic Input Representation" by Chao Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant details, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors reproduce results on several datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 3.4 (Datasets)**, where the authors summarize the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention four datasets:

1. **UCDAVIS19**: This dataset is used in the original paper they are replicating. It contains traffic data for five classes with a varying number of samples per class.

2. **MIRAGE19**: This dataset is introduced as part of their replication efforts. It includes mobile app traffic data collected from users.

3. **MIRAGE22**: Similar to MIRAGE19, this dataset focuses on video meeting services and is also used for their experiments.

4. **UTMOBILENET21**: This dataset is mentioned as another source of mobile traffic data, collected from students using instrumented phones.

In the **data curation section**, the authors provide additional details about how they processed these datasets, which is crucial for understanding their context and usage.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **UCDAVIS19**, the citation is:
  > Shahbaz Rezaei and Xin Liu. *How to Achieve High Classification Accuracy with Just a Few Labels: A Semi-supervised Approach Using Sampled Packets*. In Industrial Conference Advances in Data Mining - Applications and Theoretical Aspects (ICDM), 2019.

- For **MIRAGE19**, the citation is:
  > Giuseppe Aceto, Domenico Ciuonzo, Antonio Montieri, Valerio Persico, and Antonio Pescapè. *MIRAGE: Mobile-app Traffic Capture and Ground-truth Creation*. In IEEE 4th International Conference on Computing, Communication and Security (ICCCS 2019).

- For **MIRAGE22**, the citation is:
  > Giuseppe Aceto, Domenico Ciuonzo, Antonio Montieri, and Antonio Pescapè. *MIMETIC: Mobile encrypted traffic classification using multimodal deep learning*. Computer Networks, 165, 2019.

- For **UTMOBILENET21**, the citation is:
  > Yuqiang Heng, Vikram Chandrasekhar, and Jeffrey G. Andrews. *UTMobileNetTraffic2021: A Labeled Public Network Traffic Dataset*. IEEE Networking Letters, 3(3), 2021.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
