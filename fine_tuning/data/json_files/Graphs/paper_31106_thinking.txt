To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Partitioning Distributed Compute Jobs with Reinforcement Learning and Graph Neural Networks" by Christopher W. F. Parsonson et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract discusses the evaluation of a new partitioning algorithm on "five real deep learning computation graphs," which suggests that there are specific datasets involved.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology or experimental setup** sections. In this paper, the authors mention using computation graph profiles from "Microsoftâ€™s PipeDream research" for their experiments. This indicates that the datasets are related to deep learning job types.

I will then check the **appendix** or **references** for any detailed descriptions or citations of the datasets used. The paper explicitly states that all computation graphs used in the experiments were taken from the open-access PipeDream computation graph dataset, which is crucial information.

Now, I will compile the relevant datasets and their citations:

1. **PipeDream Dataset**: This dataset includes computation graph profiles for various deep learning job types, specifically designed for evaluating distributed training strategies. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Narayanan, D., Harlap, A., Phanishayee, A., Seshadri, V., Devanur, N., Granger, G., Gibbons, P., Zaharia, M. (2019). *Pipedream: Generalized pipeline parallelism for DNN training*. In ACM Symposium on Operating Systems Principles (SOSP 2019). URL: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/pipedream-generalized-pipeline-parallelism-for-dnn-training/.

After gathering this information, I will ensure that I format the dataset entries correctly and prepare them for any required output structure or further processing.
