To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Contrastive Variational Information Bottleneck for Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis" by Mingshan Chang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to gather initial insights about the datasets used. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments on five benchmark ABSA datasets, which indicates that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention:

1. **REST14**: This dataset is part of the SemEval-2014 task on aspect-based sentiment analysis. It includes reviews with sentiment labels for various aspects.
2. **LAP14**: Similar to REST14, this dataset is from the SemEval-2015 task and focuses on laptop reviews with aspect-level sentiment annotations.
3. **REST15**: This dataset is from the SemEval-2016 task and contains restaurant reviews with aspect-based sentiment labels.
4. **REST16**: Another dataset from the SemEval-2016 task, focusing on restaurant reviews.
5. **MAMS**: This dataset is also mentioned as a benchmark for aspect-based sentiment analysis.

In the same section, the authors provide statistics for each dataset, including the number of training and testing instances, as well as the distribution of sentiment labels (positive, neutral, negative).

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research. 

The citations for the datasets are as follows:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that all relevant details about the datasets, including their citations, are accurately captured and presented.
