To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Revisiting Graph Neural Networks: All We Have is Low-Pass Filters" by Hoang NT and Takanori Maehara, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors verify their claims on "commonly used datasets," which suggests that specific datasets will be discussed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Empirical Evidence of Assumption 1)**, where the authors explicitly mention three datasets: **Cora**, **Citeseer**, and **Pubmed**. They describe these datasets as citation networks where vertices represent scientific papers and edges represent citations. This section provides essential details about the datasets, including their characteristics and the context in which they are used.

In **section 7 (Experiments)**, the authors provide a table summarizing the datasets used in their experiments. The table includes the number of nodes, edges, classes, and the train/validation/test splits for each dataset. This information is crucial for a comprehensive understanding of the datasets.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset from the **References section** of the paper. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- **Cora Dataset**: 
  > Sen, P., Namata, G., Bilgic, M., Getoor, L., Galligher, B., & Eliassi-Rad, T. (2008). Collective classification in network data. AI Magazine, 29(3), 93-93.

- **Citeseer Dataset**: 
  > Sen, P., Namata, G., Bilgic, M., Getoor, L., Galligher, B., & Eliassi-Rad, T. (2008). Collective classification in network data. AI Magazine, 29(3), 93-93.

- **Pubmed Dataset**: 
  > Sen, P., Namata, G., Bilgic, M., Getoor, L., Galligher, B., & Eliassi-Rad, T. (2008). Collective classification in network data. AI Magazine, 29(3), 93-93.

Since the same reference is cited for all three datasets, I will ensure to note that they are all derived from the same source.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited, ready for downstream processing or review.
