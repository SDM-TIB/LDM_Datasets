To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Exploring Visual Pre-training for Robot Manipulation: Datasets, Models and Methods" by Ya Jing et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the paper discusses visual pre-training strategies and mentions a new dataset called **EgoNet**. This is a strong indication that I should look for more details about this dataset.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors highlight the importance of pre-training datasets for robot manipulation. They mention that EgoNet is created based on **Ego4D**, which suggests that I need to look for both datasets.

In the **benchmarking section**, the authors provide a detailed description of the **EgoNet dataset**, stating that it comprises nearly 500,000 video clips rich in human-object interactions. They also mention that EgoNet is constructed from Ego4D, which contains daily-life activity videos. This confirms that I need to include both datasets in my extraction.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for both datasets:

1. **EgoNet**: The paper does not provide a specific citation for EgoNet, but it is derived from Ego4D. Therefore, I will cite Ego4D as the source for EgoNet.
   > K. Grauman et al., "Ego4D: Around the world in 3,000 hours of egocentric video," in Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2022.

2. **Ego4D**: This dataset is cited as follows:
   > K. Grauman et al., "Ego4D: Around the world in 3,000 hours of egocentric video," in Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2022.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
