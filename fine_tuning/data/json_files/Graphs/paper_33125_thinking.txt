To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Emerging Drug Interaction Prediction Enabled by Flow-based Graph Neural Network with Biomedical Network" by Yongqi Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, results, and discussion sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the use of **DrugBank** and **TWOSIDES** datasets for DDI prediction, which indicates that these are the primary datasets used in the study.

Next, I will look for specific details about these datasets in the **methods section**. Here, the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. They state that the **DrugBank** dataset is utilized for predicting interactions between existing drugs, while the **TWOSIDES** dataset is used for predicting interactions between drug pairs, including emerging drugs.

In the **results section**, the authors provide performance metrics for their model on both datasets, confirming their use in the experiments. This reinforces that both datasets are integral to the study's findings.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **DrugBank**, the citation is:
  > David S Wishart, Yannick D Feunang, An C Guo, Elvis J Lo, Ana Marcu, Jason R Grant, Tanvir Sajed, Daniel Johnson, Carin Li, Zinat Sayeeda, et al. *DrugBank 5.0: a major update to the DrugBank database for 2018*. Nucleic Acids Research, 46(D1):D1074–D1082, 2018.

- For **TWOSIDES**, the citation is:
  > Nicholas P Tatonetti, Patrick P Ye, Roxana Daneshjou, and Russ B Altman. *Data-driven prediction of drug effects and interactions*. Science translational medicine, 4(125):125ra31–125ra31, 2012.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets in a structured manner, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
