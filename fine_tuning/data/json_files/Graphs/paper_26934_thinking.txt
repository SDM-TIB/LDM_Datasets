To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Framework for Generative and Contrastive Learning of Audio Representations" by Prateek Verma and Julius Smith, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and dataset sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a general overview, but the **dataset section** is likely where specific datasets will be detailed.

In **section 2 (Dataset and Audio Representation)**, the authors explicitly mention using the **UrbanSound 8K dataset**. They describe it as containing 8,732 labeled sound excerpts of urban sounds from 10 classes, which is crucial information for understanding the dataset's scope and application.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the UrbanSound 8K dataset. The relevant citation is:

- **UrbanSound 8K Dataset**:
  > Justin Salamon, Christopher Jacoby, and Juan Pablo Bello. *A dataset and taxonomy for urban sound research*. In Proceedings of the 22nd ACM International Conference on Multimedia, 2014, pp. 1041â€“1044.

Since this is the only dataset mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information about the UrbanSound 8K dataset, including its description and citation.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry in the specified format, ensuring that the full citation is included for clarity and proper referencing. This structured approach ensures that I capture all necessary details about the dataset used in the research.
