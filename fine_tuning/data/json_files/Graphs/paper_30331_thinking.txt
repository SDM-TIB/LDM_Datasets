To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Contrastive Corpus Attribution for Explaining Representations" by Chris Lin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions and may mention datasets used for evaluation or experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4), which typically contains detailed information about the datasets used in the study. In this section, the authors describe the datasets applied in their experiments, including any specific characteristics or sizes that are relevant.

Upon reviewing Section 4.1, I find that the authors mention three datasets:

1. **ImageNet**: A large-scale dataset containing 1.2 million labeled training images and 50,000 labeled validation images across 1,000 object classes. This dataset is widely used in computer vision tasks.

2. **CIFAR-10**: This dataset consists of 50,000 labeled training images and 10,000 labeled test images across 10 classes. It is a standard benchmark in machine learning for image classification.

3. **MURA**: The MURA dataset contains 36,808 training radiograph images from 13,457 musculoskeletal studies, with labels indicating whether each study is normal or abnormal.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations I find are:

- For **ImageNet**:
  > Olga Russakovsky, Jia Deng, Hao Su, Jonathan Krause, Sanjeev Satheesh, Sean Ma, Zhiheng Huang, Andrej Karpathy, Aditya Khosla, Michael Bernstein, et al. *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 115(3):211â€“252, 2015.

- For **CIFAR-10**:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton, et al. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009.

- For **MURA**:
  > Pranav Rajpurkar, Jeremy Irvin, Aarti Bagul, Daisy Ding, Tony Duan, Hershel Mehta, Brandon Yang, Kaylie Zhu, Dillon Laird, Robyn L Ball, et al. *MURA: Large Dataset for Abnormality Detection in Musculoskeletal Radiographs*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1712.06957, 2017.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or analysis. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets referenced in the paper along with their proper citations.
