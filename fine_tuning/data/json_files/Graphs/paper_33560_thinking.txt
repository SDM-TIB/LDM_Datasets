To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Semantic Parsing for Question Answering over Knowledge Graphs" by Sijia Wei et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors evaluated their method on two datasets, which indicates that I should look for specific names and details of these datasets.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Dataset)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention:

1. **GEO Dataset**: This dataset consists of 880 question-and-answer pairs related to American geographic information. The questions are in natural language, and the answers are provided in logical form using Prolog format. The authors reference a previous work for the dataset's construction.

2. **ATIS Dataset**: This dataset contains nearly 5,000 question-and-answer pairs about civil aviation flights, with answers in Lambda-DCS logical form. The authors also mention how they split the dataset into training and test sets.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **GEO Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Zettlemoyer, Luke S., and Michael Collins. "Learning to Map Sentences to Logical Form: Structured Classification with Probabilistic Categorial Grammars." In Proceedings of the Twenty-First Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI), 2005, pp. 658-666.

- For the **ATIS Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Hemphill, C., Godfrey, J. J., and D. A. K. "ATIS: A Large-Scale Natural Language Database for Spoken Language Systems." In Proceedings of the 1990 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing, 1990, pp. 965-968.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all details are accurately represented for future reference or processing.
