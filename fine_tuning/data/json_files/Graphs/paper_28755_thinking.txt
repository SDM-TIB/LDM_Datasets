To extract datasets from the research paper titled "AGPNet - Autonomous Grading Policy Network" by Chana Ross et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the work, and while it may not explicitly mention datasets, it sets the context for the experiments conducted.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section IV), as this is where datasets are typically detailed. I will look for any specific mentions of datasets used for training or evaluation. In this paper, the authors describe their simulation environment and the real-world prototype used for validation, which may imply the use of specific datasets or data generation methods.

I will also check the **related work section** to see if the authors reference any existing datasets that their work builds upon or compares against. This could provide additional context or citations for datasets relevant to their research.

After identifying potential datasets, I will consult the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access the datasets.

In this paper, the authors discuss the creation of a simulation for training and evaluating their models, which includes interactions between the dozer and the soil. However, they do not explicitly name any publicly available datasets. Instead, they describe their own simulation setup and the data generated from it.

If I find any datasets mentioned, I will ensure to write down their full citations in the appropriate format. If no external datasets are referenced, I will note that the authors created their own dataset through simulation and real-world testing.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset, its description, and the corresponding citations, ensuring that all details are accurate and complete for future reference.
