To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Hybrid Quantum Graph Neural Network for Molecular Property Prediction" by Michael Vitz et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodologies, and results sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the development of a hybrid quantum-classical model for predicting formation energies of perovskite materials, which suggests that there may be datasets related to perovskites.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the use of machine learning in materials science and mention the importance of datasets for training models. They specifically refer to a dataset used for predicting formation energies of perovskites, which indicates that I should look for more details about this dataset.

Next, I will focus on the **methodologies section**, particularly the subsection titled "Training data and feature extraction." Here, the authors state that the perovskite dataset was downloaded from the **MatBench database**. They also mention that they restricted their attention to oxide perovskites with the formula ABO3, which provides context for the dataset's content.

I will then check the **references section** to find the full citation for the MatBench database. The relevant citation is:

- **MatBench database**: 
  > Alexander Dunn, Qi Wang, Alex Ganose, Daniel Dopp, and Anubhav Jain. *Benchmarking materials property prediction methods: the matbench test set and autominer reference algorithm*. npj Computational Materials, 6(1):138, Sep 2020.

Additionally, the authors reference a specific dataset for perovskites in their work, which is:

- **Castelli Perovskites Dataset**: 
  > Ivano E Castelli, David D Landis, Kristian S Thygesen, Søren Dahl, Ib Chorkendorff, Thomas F Jaramillo, and Karsten W Jacobsen. *New cubic perovskites for one- and two-photon water splitting using the computational materials repository*. Energy & Environmental Science, 5(10):9034–9043, 2012.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will summarize the findings:

1. **Perovskite Dataset from MatBench**: This dataset is used for predicting formation energies of oxide perovskites and is crucial for the experiments conducted in the paper.

2. **Castelli Perovskites Dataset**: This dataset provides additional context and data for the study of perovskites, specifically in relation to water splitting applications.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its full citation.
