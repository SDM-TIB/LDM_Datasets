To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning to Reconstruct Missing Data from Spatiotemporal Graphs with Sparse Observations" by Ivan Marisca et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions empirical results on representative benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are used. I will pay close attention to any specific datasets mentioned.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors describe three openly available datasets used for their experiments: **PEMS-BAY**, **METR-LA**, and **AQI**. I will note down the details provided for each dataset, including their characteristics and the context in which they were used.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide a brief description of each dataset:
1. **PEMS-BAY**: This dataset records traffic measurements every 5 minutes from 325 speed sensors in the San Francisco Bay Area.
2. **METR-LA**: Similar to PEMS-BAY, this dataset records traffic measurements from 207 sensors in Los Angeles County Highway.
3. **AQI**: This dataset collects hourly measurements of air pollutants from 437 air quality monitoring stations across 43 cities in China.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and will typically include the authors, title, publication venue, and year.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:
- For **PEMS-BAY** and **METR-LA**, the citation is:
  > Yaguang Li, Rose Yu, Cyrus Shahabi, and Yan Liu. *Diffusion convolutional recurrent neural network: Data-driven traffic forecasting*. In International Conference on Learning Representations, 2018.

- For **AQI**, the citation is:
  > Yu Zheng, Xiuwen Yi, Ming Li, Ruiyuan Li, Zhangqing Shan, Eric Chang, and Tianrui Li. *Forecasting fine-grained air quality based on big data*. In Proceedings of the 21st ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, pages 2267â€“2276, 2015.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or processing. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets referenced in the paper along with their proper citations.
