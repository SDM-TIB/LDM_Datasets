To extract datasets from the research paper titled "InfiniteWalk: Deep Network Embeddings as Laplacian Embeddings with a Nonlinearity" by Sudhanshu Chanpuriya and Cameron Musco, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview, and the introduction often highlights the datasets used in the experiments.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the context of their work and mention that they will evaluate their method on various datasets. This indicates that datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention using three datasets: 

1. **BlogCatalog**: A social network of bloggers with 10,312 vertices and 333,983 edges, where vertex labels represent group memberships corresponding to interests of bloggers.

2. **PPI (Protein-Protein Interaction)**: A subgraph of the PPI network for Homo Sapiens, containing 3,852 vertices and 76,546 edges, where vertices represent proteins and edges represent interactions between them.

3. **Wikipedia**: A co-occurrence network of words from a portion of the Wikipedia dump, consisting of 4,777 vertices and 184,812 edges, where nodes represent words and edges represent co-occurrences within a window of length 2.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **BlogCatalog**, the citation is:
  > Agarwal, N., Liu, H., Murthy, S., Sen, A., & Wang, X. (2009). A social identity approach to identify familiar strangers in a social network. In *Third International AAAI Conference on Weblogs and Social Media*.

- For **PPI**, the citation is:
  > Stark, C., Breitkreutz, B.-J., Chatr-Aryamontri, A., Boucher, L., Oughtred, R., Livstone, M. S., Nixon, J., Van Auken, K., Wang, X., Shi, X., et al. (2010). The BioGRID interaction database: 2011 update. *Nucleic acids research*, 39(suppl_1), D698–D704.

- For **Wikipedia**, the citation is:
  > Grover, A., & Leskovec, J. (2016). node2vec: Scalable feature learning for networks. In *Proceedings of the 22nd ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining* (pp. 855–864).

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will facilitate further research and validation of the findings presented in the paper.
