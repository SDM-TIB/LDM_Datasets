To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Efficient Betti Matching Enables Topology-Aware 3D Segmentation via Persistent Homology" by Nico Stucki et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the use of several datasets for demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method, which indicates that there are datasets to extract.

Next, I will focus on the **experimentation section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this paper, the authors mention four datasets:

1. **VesSAP Dataset**: This dataset consists of light-sheet microscopy images of mouse brains, specifically focusing on the segmentation of vessel structures. The authors note that it contains complex topological structures.

2. **BBBC027 Dataset**: This dataset includes synthetic colon cell microscopy images. The authors highlight that it exhibits many small connected components, which are crucial for their segmentation tasks.

3. **CREMI Dataset**: This dataset is a neuroimaging dataset containing brain tissue scans of Drosophila melanogaster. The authors use it to evaluate their method on a topologically complex label map.

4. **Synthetic Spheres Dataset**: This is a synthetic dataset created to challenge the segmentation task, consisting of hollow spheres with specific connectivity properties.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:

- For **VesSAP Dataset**:
  > Mihail Ivilinov Todorov et al. *Machine learning analysis of whole mouse brain vasculature*. Nature Methods, 17(4):442–449, April 2020.

- For **BBBC027 Dataset**:
  > David Svoboda et al. *Generation of 3D Digital Phantoms of Colon Tissue*. In Image Analysis and Recognition, pages 31–39, Berlin, Heidelberg, 2011.

- For **CREMI Dataset**:
  > Jan Funke et al. *Large Scale Image Segmentation with Structured Loss Based Deep Learning for Connectome Reconstruction*. IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 41(7):1669–1680, July 2019.

- For **Synthetic Spheres Dataset**: 
  > This dataset is described in the paper itself and does not have a formal citation as it is a synthetic dataset created by the authors.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations into a structured format for further processing.
