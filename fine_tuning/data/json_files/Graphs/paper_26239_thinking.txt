To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Graph Neural Networks for Human-aware Social Navigation" by Luis J. Manso et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the use of the **SocNav1 dataset** for benchmarking their proposed methods. This indicates that there is at least one dataset that I need to extract.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the dataset is discussed in detail in **section 3 (Formalisation of the problem)**. Here, the authors describe the **SocNav1 dataset**, which provides social compliance labels for various scenarios involving robots and humans.

The paper states that the **SocNav1 dataset** contains:
- 16,336 labeled samples for training,
- 556 scenarios for development,
- 556 additional scenarios for testing.

The dataset is specifically designed to evaluate how well a robot's position complies with social conventions in a given scenario.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the **SocNav1 dataset**. The citation provided in the references is:
> Manso, L.J., Nuez, P., Calderita, L.V., Faria, D.R., Bachiller, P. (2020). Socnav1: A dataset to benchmark and learn social navigation conventions. *Data*, 5(1), 7. URL: https://www.mdpi.com/2306-5729/5/1/7

Since this is the only dataset mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information about the **SocNav1 dataset** along with its citation.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry, ensuring that I include all relevant details and the full citation as required. This will ensure that the dataset is accurately represented and properly credited in any further analysis or application.
