To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Interactive Contrastive Learning for Self-Supervised Entity Alignment" by Kaisheng Zeng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of a dataset called **DBP15K**, which is a clear indication that this is a dataset of interest. The introduction further elaborates on the significance of knowledge graphs and entity alignment, hinting at the datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments** section. In this paper, the authors describe the **DBP15K dataset** in detail, including its structure and the languages involved (English, Chinese, Japanese, and French). They provide statistics about the dataset, such as the number of entities, relations, and alignments, which are crucial for understanding the dataset's scope.

I will also check the **experiments section** to confirm that the authors used the **DBP15K dataset** for their evaluations. They mention that their experimental results are based on this dataset, which solidifies its relevance.

Now, I will consult the **references section** to find the full citation for the **DBP15K dataset**. The citation is as follows:
> Zequn Sun, Wei Hu, and Chengkai Li. *Cross-Lingual Entity Alignment via Joint Attribute-Preserving Embedding*. In Proceedings of the 2017 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), pages 628â€“644, 2017.

After gathering all this information, I will summarize the dataset details, including its name, description, and citation, ensuring that I adhere to the required format for clarity and completeness.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format that is ready for review or further processing.
