To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Improving Sentence Similarity Estimation for Unsupervised Extractive Summarization" by Shichao Sun et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on two datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experiment and Analysis)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. They state that they evaluate their sentence similarity estimation on two summarization datasets: **NYT** and **CNNDM**. This is a clear indication that these are the datasets I need to extract.

I will then look for any additional details about these datasets in the text. The authors mention that the final training dataset contains **322,828 documents** with more than five sentences, and they randomly selected **500 samples** from both the CNNDM validation dataset and the NYT validation dataset for quick validation. However, they do not provide extensive descriptions of the datasets beyond their names.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **NYT dataset**, the citation is:
  > Evan Sandhaus, “The New York Times Annotated Corpus,” Linguistic Data Consortium, Philadelphia, vol. 6, no. 12, pp. e26752, 2008.

- For the **CNNDM dataset**, the citation is:
  > Karl Moritz Hermann, Tomáš Kočiský, Edward Grefenstette, Lasse Espeholt, Will Kay, Mustafa Suleyman, and Phil Blunsom, “Teaching machines to read and comprehend,” in Proceedings of the 28th International Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems - Volume 1, Cambridge, MA, USA, 2015, NIPS’15, pp. 1693–1701, MIT Press.

With this information, I have successfully identified the datasets used in the paper and their full citations. I will now compile this information into the required format for further processing.
