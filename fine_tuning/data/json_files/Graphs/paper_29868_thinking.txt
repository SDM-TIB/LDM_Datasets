To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-granularity Item-based Contrastive Recommendation" by Ruobing Xie et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on "real-world datasets," which indicates that datasets are indeed used, but I need to find their specific names and details.

Next, I will look closely at the **experiments section** (Section 5) where the authors describe their experimental settings. In this section, they explicitly mention two datasets:

1. **Video-636M**: This dataset contains nearly 25 million users and 636 million click instances. It is designed for video recommendation tasks.

2. **News-76M**: This dataset consists of approximately 6.4 million users and 76 million click instances, specifically for news recommendation.

I will also check the **statistics table** (Table 1) that provides detailed information about the datasets, confirming the number of users, items, sessions, and clicks for both datasets.

Now, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. However, since these datasets are likely proprietary or created by the authors for their specific research, they may not have formal citations like publicly available datasets. In this case, I will note that the datasets are described in the paper itself and provide the relevant details.

The citations for the datasets will be as follows:

- For **Video-636M**, the citation is:
  > Ruobing Xie, Zhijie Qiu, Bo Zhang, and Leyu Lin. *Multi-granularity Item-based Contrastive Recommendation*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML), 2022.

- For **News-76M**, the citation is:
  > Ruobing Xie, Zhijie Qiu, Bo Zhang, and Leyu Lin. *Multi-granularity Item-based Contrastive Recommendation*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML), 2022.

Since both datasets are part of the same study, they share the same citation.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include all relevant details and citations in the required format for further processing or review.
