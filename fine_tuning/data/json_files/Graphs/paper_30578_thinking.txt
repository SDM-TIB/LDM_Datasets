To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Joint Data and Feature Augmentation for Self-Supervised Representation Learning on Point Clouds" by Zhuheng Lu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on various tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experimental Results)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention using the **ShapeNet dataset** for self-supervised representation learning, which consists of 57,448 objects from 55 categories. This is a significant dataset for point cloud analysis.

Additionally, they mention two more datasets in the context of object classification and part segmentation tasks:

1. **ModelNet40**: This dataset includes 12,331 objects from 40 categories, with a training split of 9,843 examples and a testing split of 2,468 examples.

2. **ScanObjectNN**: This dataset contains 2,880 objects from 15 categories, with 2,304 for training and 576 for testing.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **ShapeNet**, the citation is:

- For **ModelNet40**, the citation is:

- For **ScanObjectNN**, the citation is:

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
