To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Suppressing Static Visual Cues via Normalizing Flows for Self-Supervised Video Representation Learning" by Manlin Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions "extensive experiments on publicly available benchmarks," which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically the subsection titled "Datasets and Implementation Details." Here, the authors list the datasets used for their experiments:

1. **UCF101**: This dataset is referenced as a collection of 101 human action classes from videos in the wild. It is a well-known benchmark for action recognition tasks.

2. **HMDB51**: This dataset is mentioned as a large video database for human motion recognition, containing 51 action categories.

3. **Kinetics-400**: The authors refer to this dataset as containing 400 human action classes, which is widely used for training and evaluating action recognition models.

4. **Kinetics-200**: This is a subset of the Kinetics dataset, containing 200 action classes.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **UCF101**, the citation is:
  > Soomro, K., Zamir, A. R., & Shah, M. (2012). *UCF101: A dataset of 101 human actions classes from videos in the wild*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1212.0402.

- For **HMDB51**, the citation is:

- For **Kinetics-400**, the citation is:

- For **Kinetics-200**, the citation is:
  > Xie, S., Sun, C., Huang, J., Tu, Z., & Murphy, K. (2018). *Rethinking Spatiotemporal Feature Learning: Speed-Accuracy Trade-offs in Video Classification*. In ECCV, 318–335.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, which is essential for understanding the context and validity of the experiments conducted.
