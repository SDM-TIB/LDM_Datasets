To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Key Point Analysis via Contrastive Learning and Extractive Argument Summarization" by Milad Alshomary et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions a shared task related to key point analysis, which suggests that there may be datasets associated with this task. The introduction provides context about the task and references previous works, which may also lead to identifying datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **Datasets** section or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors describe the dataset used for the Key Point Analysis (KPA) shared task, which is crucial for understanding the data they worked with.

In **section 3 (Task Description)**, the authors explicitly mention that they start from the dataset provided by the organizers of the KPA shared task. They describe the dataset as containing 28 controversial topics, 6515 arguments, and 243 key points, which is essential information for the dataset entry.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset mentioned. The dataset is attributed to the work of Friedman et al. (2021), which is critical for proper citation.

The citation for the dataset is:
> Roni Friedman, Lena Dankin, Yoav Katz, Yufang Hou, and Noam Slonim. *Overview of KPA-2021 shared task: Key point based quantitative summarization*. In Proceedings of the KPA-2021 shared task, 2021.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and full citation. This will allow for a clear and comprehensive representation of the dataset used in the research.

After gathering all necessary details, I will prepare the dataset entry for review or further processing.
