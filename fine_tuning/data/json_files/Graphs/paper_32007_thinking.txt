To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Exploiting Abstract Meaning Representation for Open-Domain Question Answering" by Cunxiang Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** of the paper. The authors mention that they validate their method using two datasets: **Natural Questions (NQ)** and **TriviaQA (TQ)**. This indicates that these datasets are central to their research.

Next, I will proceed to the **introduction** section. Here, the authors discuss the challenges of Open-Domain Question Answering (ODQA) and reference the datasets again, confirming their importance in the experiments conducted.

In the **experiments section (Section 4)**, the authors explicitly state that they use the **Natural Questions** and **TriviaQA** datasets for their evaluations. They provide additional context about how these datasets are utilized, including the retrieval and reading processes involved in their methodology.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

1. For the **Natural Questions (NQ)** dataset, the citation is:
   > Tom Kwiatkowski, Jennimaria Palomaki, Olivia Redfield, Michael Collins, Ankur Parikh, Chris Alberti, Daniele Epstein, Illia Polosukhin, Matthew Kelcey, Jacob Devlin, Kenton Lee, Kristina N. Toutanova, Llion Jones, Ming-Wei Chang, Andrew Dai, Jakob Uszkoreit, Quoc Le, and Slav Petrov. *Natural Questions: A Benchmark for Question Answering Research*. Transactions of the Association of Computational Linguistics, 2019.

2. For the **TriviaQA** dataset, the citation is:
   > Mandar Joshi, Eunsol Choi, Daniel S. Weld, and Luke Zettlemoyer. *TriviaQA: A Large Scale Distantly Supervised Challenge Dataset for Reading Comprehension*. In Proceedings of the 55th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, Vancouver, Canada, 2017.

Having gathered the necessary information, I will now summarize the datasets:

- **Natural Questions (NQ)**: A dataset designed for evaluating question answering systems, containing questions and corresponding passages from Wikipedia.
- **TriviaQA (TQ)**: A large-scale dataset for reading comprehension, featuring questions and answers derived from trivia questions.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries with their full citations, ensuring that all information is accurately represented for future reference or processing.
