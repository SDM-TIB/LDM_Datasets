To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Restoring Vision in Hazy Weather with Hierarchical Contrastive Learning" by Tao Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that extensive experiments were conducted on public datasets, which indicates that datasets are likely discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they explicitly mention three datasets:

1. **RESIDE**: This is a large-scale synthetic dataset that includes various subsets such as Indoor Training Set (ITS), Outdoor Training Set (OTS), Synthetic Objective Testing Set (SOTS), Real World task-driven Testing Set (RTTS), and Hybrid Subjective Testing Set (HSTS). The authors provide specific details about the number of hazy and clear images in the subsets.

2. **HazeRD**: This dataset is noted for being collected in real-world scenarios, which adds to its significance in evaluating the proposed method.

3. **DENSE-HAZE**: Another dataset mentioned, which is also used for benchmarking image dehazing methods.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **RESIDE**, the citation is:
  > B. Li, W. Ren, D. Fu, D. Tao, D. Feng, W. Zeng, Z. Wang. *Benchmarking single-image dehazing and beyond*. IEEE Transactions on Image Processing, 28(1):492-505, 2018.

- For **HazeRD**, the citation is:
  > Y. Zhang, L. Ding, G. Sharma. *Hazerd: an outdoor scene dataset and benchmark for single image dehazing*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Image Processing, pages 3205-3209, 2017.

- For **DENSE-HAZE**, the citation is:
  > C. O. Ancuti, C. Ancuti, M. Sbert, R. Timofte. *Dense-haze: A benchmark for image dehazing with dense-haze and haze-free images*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Image Processing, pages 1014-1018, 2019.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or processing.
