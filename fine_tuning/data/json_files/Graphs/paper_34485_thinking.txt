To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Mining the Explainability and Generalization: Fact Verification Based on Self-Instruction" by Guangyao Lu and Yulin Liu, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. In the abstract, the authors mention evaluating their method on **two challenging fact-checking datasets: FEVEROUS and HOVER**. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for the research.

Next, I will look into **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for evaluation:

1. **FEVEROUS**: This dataset is described as consisting of fact-checking data with various challenges such as Numerical Reasoning, Entity Disambiguation, and Multi-hop Reasoning. It was proposed by Aly et al. (2021).

2. **HOVER**: This dataset is noted as a more challenging multi-hop fact-checking dataset, with a maximum hop count of 4. It was proposed by Yang et al. (2018).

In the **experiments section**, the authors confirm that they utilized both **FEVEROUS** and **HOVER** for their experiments, reinforcing their significance in the study.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to retrieve the full citations for these datasets:

- For **FEVEROUS**, the citation is:
  > Rami Aly, Zhijiang Guo, Michael Sejr Schlichtkrull, James Thorne, Andreas Vlachos, Christos Christodoulopoulos, Oana Cocarascu, and Arpit Mittal. *The fact extraction and VERification over unstructured and structured information (FEVEROUS) shared task*. In Proceedings of the Fourth Workshop on Fact Extraction and VERification (FEVER), pages 1–13, Dominican Republic, November 2021. Association for Computational Linguistics. doi: 10.18653/v1/2021.fever-1.1. URL: https://aclanthology.org/2021.fever-1.1.

- For **HOVER**, the citation is:
  > Zhilin Yang, Peng Qi, Saizheng Zhang, Yoshua Bengio, William Cohen, Ruslan Salakhutdinov, and Christopher D. Manning. *HotpotQA: A dataset for diverse, explainable multi-hop question answering*. In Proceedings of the 2018 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 2369–2380, Brussels, Belgium, October-November 2018. Association for Computational Linguistics. doi: 10.18653/v1/D18-1259. URL: https://aclanthology.org/D18-1259.

With this information, I will now compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
