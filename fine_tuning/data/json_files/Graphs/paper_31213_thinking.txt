To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SAM operates far from home: eigenvalue regularization as a dynamical phenomenon" by Atish Agarwala and Yann Dauphin, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and while it may not explicitly mention datasets, it can hint at the experiments conducted.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**. This section typically contains detailed descriptions of the datasets used for training and evaluation. I will look for any specific names of datasets, their characteristics, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

In this paper, the authors mention using the **CIFAR-10 dataset** for their experiments. I will note the context in which it is used, specifically that it is employed with the WideResnet 28-10 architecture and for both MSE and cross-entropy loss functions.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the CIFAR-10 dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Krizhevsky, A., Hinton, G., et al. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. 2009.

Additionally, I will look for any other datasets mentioned throughout the paper, especially in the context of experiments or comparisons. If there are any other datasets, I will extract their names, descriptions, and citations in a similar manner.

After gathering all the relevant information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and that full citations are included. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
