To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Large-Scale Learnable Graph Convolutional Networks" by Hongyang Gao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions experimental results on several datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed used in the research. I will look for specific names of datasets mentioned in these sections.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4) where the authors typically provide detailed information about the datasets used. In this section, I will look for any tables or lists that summarize the datasets, as well as any descriptions that provide context about their use in the experiments.

In **Section 4.1 (Datasets)**, the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. They mention:

1. **Cora Dataset**: A citation network with 2,708 nodes, 1,433 features, and 7 classes.
2. **Citeseer Dataset**: Another citation network with 3,327 nodes, 3,703 features, and 6 classes.
3. **Pubmed Dataset**: A larger citation network with 19,717 nodes, 500 features, and 3 classes.
4. **PPI Dataset**: A protein-protein interaction dataset with 56,944 nodes, 50 features, and 121 classes, used for inductive learning.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The paper cites the following sources:

- For the **Cora Dataset**:
  > Sen, P., Namata, G., Bilgic, M., Getoor, L., Galligher, J., & Eliassi-Rad, T. (2008). Collective classification in network data. AI magazine, 29(3), 93.

- For the **Citeseer Dataset**:
  > Yang, Z., Cohen, W. W., & Salakhutdinov, R. (2016). Revisiting semi-supervised learning with graph embeddings. International Conference on Machine Learning.

- For the **Pubmed Dataset**:
  > Yang, Z., Cohen, W. W., & Salakhutdinov, R. (2016). Revisiting semi-supervised learning with graph embeddings. International Conference on Machine Learning.

- For the **PPI Dataset**:
  > Zitnik, M., & Leskovec, J. (2017). Predicting multicellular function through multi-layer tissue networks. Bioinformatics, 33(14), i190-i198.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset along with its citation. This will ensure that I have accurately captured all necessary details for future reference or processing.
