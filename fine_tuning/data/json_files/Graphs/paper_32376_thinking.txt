To extract datasets from the research paper titled "JOTR: 3D Joint Contrastive Learning with Transformers for Occluded Human Mesh Recovery" by Jiahao Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on 3D human mesh recovery and hints at the use of various benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will examine the **introduction section** more closely. Here, the authors discuss the challenges of 3D human mesh recovery and mention that their method is validated on several benchmarks. This indicates that specific datasets will be referenced later in the paper.

I will then look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for evaluation, which include:

1. **3DPW (3D Poses in the Wild)**: This dataset is a large-scale benchmark for 3D human mesh recovery, containing various scenarios including occlusions. It is referenced multiple times throughout the paper, indicating its significance in the experiments.

2. **3DPW-PC (3DPW Person-Person Occlusion)**: A subset of the 3DPW dataset that focuses on scenarios with person-to-person occlusions, which is crucial for evaluating the robustness of the proposed method.

3. **3DPW-OC (3DPW Person-Object Occlusion)**: Another subset of the 3DPW dataset, specifically designed for evaluating performance in scenarios where objects occlude the target person.

4. **3DOH (3D Occluded Humans)**: A dataset that includes instances of occluded humans, providing additional challenges for the evaluation of the proposed method.

5. **CMU Panoptic**: A dataset that contains multi-person indoor scenes, which is also used for evaluation in the paper.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

The full citations I will extract are:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
