To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "An Ontology-Aware Framework for Audio Event Classification" by Yiwei Sun and Shabnam Ghaffarzadegan, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the framework is evaluated on two benchmark datasets for audio event classification tasks, which indicates that datasets are present.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly introduce the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention two datasets:

1. **DCASE 2019-task5 (D19T5)**: This dataset is used for multi-label Urban Sound Tagging in the DCASE 2019 challenge, Task 5. It consists of recordings from an acoustic sensor network in New York City, annotated for 23 urban sound noise labels (fine labels) and categorized into 8 main categories (coarse labels). The recordings are 10 seconds long, single-channel, and in 44.1 kHz, 16-bit wave format.

2. **Urban Sounds (US8K)**: This dataset contains 8,732 labeled urban sound excerpts, each lasting less than 4 seconds, from 10 classes with only one label per recording. All recordings are single-channel, 44.1 kHz, 16-bit wave format, and the files are pre-sorted into ten folds. The authors also mention using a two-level ontology with 4 classes at the coarse level and 10 classes at the fine level.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper:

- For **DCASE 2019-task5 (D19T5)**, the citation is:
  > Juan P. Bello, Claudio Silva, Oded Nov, R. Luke Dubois, Anish Arora, Justin Salamon, Charles Mydlarz, and Harish Doraiswamy. *Sonyc: A system for monitoring, analyzing, and mitigating urban noise pollution*. Communications of the ACM, vol. 62, no. 2, pp. 68–77, Feb 2019.

- For **Urban Sounds (US8K)**, the citation is:
  > Justin Salamon, Christopher Jacoby, and Juan Pablo Bello. *A dataset and taxonomy for urban sound research*. In Proceedings of the 22nd ACM International Conference on Multimedia, New York, NY, USA, 2014, MM '14, pp. 1041–1044, ACM.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will prepare to compile this information into a structured format for further use. This includes ensuring that each dataset is clearly described with its citation for proper attribution.
