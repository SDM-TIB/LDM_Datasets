To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "Tucker Decomposition Network: Expressive Power and Comparison" by Ye Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on two datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experimental Results)**, where the authors describe their experiments. Here, they explicitly mention using two datasets: **Mnist** and **CIFAR-10**. I will take note of the descriptions provided for each dataset, including their characteristics and the context in which they were used.

1. **Mnist Dataset**: The authors describe the MNIST database as containing handwritten digits with a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples, each image being 28 × 28 pixels. This dataset is widely used for benchmarking image classification algorithms.

2. **CIFAR-10 Dataset**: The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 color images of size 32 × 32 pixels, categorized into 10 classes. This dataset is also a standard benchmark in the field of machine learning for image classification tasks.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **MNIST dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun, Bernhard E. Boser, John S. Denker, David Henderson, Rueben E. Howard, Wayne E. Hubbard, and Lawrence D. Jackel. *Handwritten digit recognition with a back-propagation network*. In Advances in neural information processing systems, pages 396–404, 1990.

- For the **CIFAR-10 dataset**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. Technical report, Citeseer, 2009.

Having gathered the necessary information, I will summarize the datasets with their descriptions and citations. This will ensure that I have a comprehensive understanding of the datasets used in the research and their significance in the experiments conducted by the authors.
