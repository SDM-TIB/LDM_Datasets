To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Discriminative Features for Crowd Counting" by Yuehai Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the challenges in crowd counting and the proposed methods, but it does not specify datasets. Therefore, I will focus on the **experiments section** where datasets are typically detailed.

In the **experiments section**, the authors mention that they conducted experiments on several widely used crowd counting datasets. I will look for specific mentions of these datasets, including their names and any relevant details.

Upon reviewing the **experimental setups**, I find the following datasets explicitly mentioned:

1. **ShanghaiTech A Dataset**: This dataset consists of 482 images with highly congested scenes, where the crowd counts range from 33 to 3139. It is divided into 300 training images and 182 testing images.

2. **ShanghaiTech B Dataset**: This dataset contains 716 images taken from busy streets in Shanghai, with crowd counts varying from 9 to 578. It is split into 400 training images and 316 testing images.

3. **UCF CC 50 Dataset**: This dataset includes 50 images of varying resolutions, with crowd counts ranging from 94 to 4,543. The authors mention that due to the limited training samples, they performed 5-fold cross-validation.

4. **UCF-QNRF Dataset**: This challenging dataset contains 1,535 images, with crowd counts ranging from 816 to 12,865. It is divided into 1,201 training images and 334 testing images.

5. **NWPU Dataset**: The largest-scale dataset mentioned, consisting of 5,109 images with crowd counts ranging from 0 to 20,003. The ground truth for the test images is not released, and results can be submitted online for evaluation.

6. **JHU-Crowd++ Dataset**: This dataset contains 4,372 images with 1.51 million dot annotations, categorized into low, medium, and high-density images.

Next, I will refer to the **References section** to gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

- For **ShanghaiTech A and B Datasets**, the citation is:
  > Zhang, Y., Zhou, D., Chen, S., Gao, S., & Ma, Y. (2016). *Single-image crowd counting via multi-column convolutional neural network*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pp. 589-597.

- For **UCF CC 50 Dataset**, the citation is:

- For **UCF-QNRF Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Wang, Q., Gao, J., Lin, W., & Yuan, Y. (2020). *NWPU-Crowd: A large-scale benchmark for crowd counting and localization*. IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 43(6), 2141-2149.

- For **NWPU Dataset**, the citation is the same as above since it is part of the same paper.

- For **JHU-Crowd++ Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Sindagi, V. A., Yasarla, R., & Patel, V. M. (2020). *JHU-Crowd++: Large-scale crowd counting dataset and a benchmark method*. IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 44(5), 2594-2609.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
