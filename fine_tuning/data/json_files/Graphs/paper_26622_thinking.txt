To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Knowledge Embedding Based Graph Convolutional Network" by Donghan Yu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the experimental results are based on benchmark datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors discuss their experiments in **Section 5**, where they mention using the **DBP15K** dataset for knowledge graph alignment tasks. This section provides specific statistics about the dataset, including the number of entities, relations, and triplets.

I will summarize the relevant datasets as follows:

1. **DBP15K**: This dataset is used for knowledge graph alignment and includes multiple language pairs. The statistics provided in the paper indicate:
   - **DBPZH-EN** (Chinese-English): 66,469 entities, 2,830 relations, 153,929 triplets.
   - **DBPJA-EN** (Japanese-English): 65,744 entities, 2,043 relations, 164,373 triplets.
   - **DBPFR-EN** (French-English): 66,858 entities, 1,379 relations, 192,191 triplets.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the DBP15K dataset. The paper cites the dataset as follows:

- For **DBP15K**, the citation is:
  > Zequn Sun, Wei Hu, and Chengkai Li. *Cross-lingual entity alignment via joint attribute-preserving embedding*. In International Semantic Web Conference. Springer, 628â€“644, 2018.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and includes the full citation.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring that all necessary details are included for future reference or processing.
