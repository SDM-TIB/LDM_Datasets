To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Real-Time Small-Signal Security Assessment Using Graph Neural Networks" by Glory Justin and Santiago Paternain, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors use data from Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs) and mentions case studies with simulated data from the IEEE 68-bus system and the NPCC 140-bus system. This suggests that these two systems are likely datasets of interest.

Next, I will focus on **section IV (Simulation and Results)**, where the authors describe the data generation process and the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they explicitly mention two datasets:

1. **Dataset 1**: This dataset is derived from the IEEE 68-bus system. The authors explain that they varied the active power generation and load active/reactive powers to generate 6253 data points, with a classification of 56% safe and 44% unsafe cases.

2. **Dataset 2**: This dataset comes from the NPCC 140-bus system. Similar to Dataset 1, the authors varied the active power generation and load powers, resulting in 4725 data points, with 29% safe cases and 71% unsafe cases.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The IEEE 68-bus system and NPCC 140-bus system are commonly referenced in power systems literature, so I will look for authoritative sources.

- For the **IEEE 68-bus system**, the citation is:
  > Chow, Joe H., and Juan J. Sanchez-Gasca. *Power system modeling, computation, and control*. John Wiley & Sons, 2020.

- For the **NPCC 140-bus system**, the citation is:
  > J. H. Chow, et al, "Singular perturbations coherency and aggregation of dynamic systems," Report Electric Utility Systems Engineering Department General Electric Company Schenectady, 1981.

Having gathered this information, I will now summarize the datasets with their respective citations, ensuring that I maintain clarity and accuracy in the descriptions. This will prepare me for the next step of structuring the dataset information appropriately for further processing or review.
