To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Clinically Labeled Contrastive Learning for OCT Biomarker Classification" by K. Kokilepersaud et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions a novel approach for contrastive learning based on clinical data, which suggests that there may be datasets involved. I will look for any specific dataset names or descriptions in these sections.

Next, I will examine the **methodology** section, particularly the part where the authors discuss the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention the **OLIVES dataset**, which is crucial for their study. I will note the details provided about this dataset, including its size, the types of images it contains, and the clinical and biomarker labels associated with it.

In the **experiments** section, I will look for any additional datasets that may be referenced or used for validation or comparison purposes. The authors may discuss other datasets in relation to their findings or methodologies.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. For the OLIVES dataset, I will look for the original paper that describes it, as well as any other relevant studies that provide context or additional information about the dataset.

The citation for the OLIVES dataset is:
> Mohit Prabhushankar, Kiran Kokilepersaud, Yash-yee Logan, Stephanie Trejo Corona, Ghassan AlRegib, and Charles Wykoff. *OLIVES Dataset: Ophthalmic Labels for Investigating Visual Eye Semantics*. In Proceedings of the Neural Information Processing Systems Track on Datasets and Benchmarks 2 (NeurIPS Datasets and Benchmarks 2022), Under Review.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their descriptions and citations, ensuring that I maintain clarity and accuracy in the representation of each dataset.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for any required structured output, ensuring that each dataset is clearly defined and properly cited for future reference or analysis.
