To extract datasets from the research paper titled "FAM: Relative Flatness Aware Minimization" by Linara Adilova et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, but I need to focus on sections that explicitly mention datasets used for experiments.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the theoretical background and motivation for their work, but they do not mention specific datasets. Therefore, I will proceed to the **experiments section** where datasets are likely to be detailed.

In **section 4 (Experiments)**, the authors describe their empirical evaluations. They mention several datasets used for image classification tasks:

1. **CIFAR10**: A well-known dataset for image classification containing 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class.

2. **CIFAR100**: Similar to CIFAR10 but with 100 classes containing 600 images each.

3. **SVHN (Street View House Numbers)**: A real-world image dataset for digit recognition, containing over 600,000 labeled digits.

4. **FashionMNIST**: A dataset consisting of 70,000 grayscale images of clothing items, serving as a drop-in replacement for the original MNIST dataset.

Next, I will look for the **full citations** for these datasets in the **References section** of the paper:

- For **CIFAR10** and **CIFAR100**, the citation is:
  > Krizhevsky, A., & Hinton, G. (2009). Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images. Technical report, University of Toronto.

- For **SVHN**, the citation is:
  > Netzer, Y., Wang, T., Coates, A., Bissacco, A., Wu, B., & Ng, A. (2011). Reading digits in natural images with unsupervised feature learning. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems.

- For **FashionMNIST**, the citation is:
  > Xiao, H., Rasul, K., & Vollgraf, R. (2017). Fashion-MNIST: A novel image dataset for benchmarking machine learning algorithms. arXiv preprint arXiv:1708.07747.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. This includes ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation, which is crucial for proper attribution and reference in future work.
