To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Prompted Contrast with Masked Motion Modeling: Towards Versatile 3D Action Representation Learning" by Jiahang Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for evaluation. The introduction often elaborates on the significance of the datasets in the context of the research.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experimental Results)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, the authors mention three datasets:

1. **NTU RGB+D 60 Dataset (NTU 60)**: This dataset contains 56,578 videos with 25 joints per frame and includes 60 action categories. The authors specify two evaluation protocols: Cross-Subject (xsub) and Cross-View (xview).

2. **NTU RGB+D 120 Dataset (NTU 120)**: An extension of the NTU 60 dataset, it includes 114,480 videos and 120 action categories. The evaluation protocols mentioned are Cross-Subject (xsub) and Cross-Setup (xset).

3. **PKU Multi-Modality Dataset (PKUMMD)**: This dataset is designed for multi-modality 3D understanding of human actions, containing 51 action categories and nearly 20,000 instances. The authors mention using a cross-subject protocol for evaluation.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **NTU RGB+D 60 Dataset**:
  > Amir Shahroudy, Jun Liu, Tian-Tsong Ng, and Gang Wang. *NTU RGB+D: A Large Scale Dataset for 3D Human Activity Analysis*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2016.

- For **NTU RGB+D 120 Dataset**:
  > Jun Liu, Amir Shahroudy, Mauricio Perez, Gang Wang, Ling-Yu Duan, and Alex C. Kot. *NTU RGB+D 120: A Large-Scale Benchmark for 3D Human Activity Understanding*. IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence (TPAMI), 2019.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
