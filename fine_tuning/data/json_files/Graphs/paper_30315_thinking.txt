To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Pareto Actor-Critic for Equilibrium Selection in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning" by Filippos Christianos et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, and the introduction often discusses the context and relevance of the datasets used.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. This is typically where authors describe the datasets they used for their evaluations. If the paper includes a section specifically titled "Datasets" or similar, I will pay close attention to that section for detailed descriptions.

In this paper, the authors mention evaluating their algorithm on various multi-agent games, including:

1. **Climbing Game**: A two-agent matrix game with multiple actions and Nash equilibria.
2. **Penalty Game**: Another two-agent matrix game with distinct Nash equilibria.
3. **Boulder Push**: A grid-world environment where agents must cooperate to push a boulder.
4. **Level-Based Foraging (LBF)**: A grid-world task where agents forage for food items based on their levels.

I will then check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets or games mentioned. Since the games are likely original contributions of the authors, I will note that they may not have formal citations like traditional datasets but will still document them as they are critical to the research.

For each identified dataset or game, I will compile the following information:
- **Name**: The name of the dataset or game.
- **Description**: A brief description of what the dataset or game entails, including the number of agents, actions, and any relevant characteristics.
- **Citation**: The full citation for the dataset or game, if available.

After gathering this information, I will ensure that each dataset entry is clearly documented with the necessary details, including citations where applicable. This structured approach will help in accurately representing the datasets used in the research paper.
