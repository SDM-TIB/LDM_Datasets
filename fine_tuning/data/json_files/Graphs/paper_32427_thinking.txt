To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Bootstrapping Contrastive Learning Enhanced Music Cold-Start Matching" by Ying Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions a specific matching task called Music Cold-Start Matching and hints at the use of a dataset named **XMusic**. This indicates that there is at least one dataset that I need to look into further.

Next, I will proceed to **section 4.1 (Experimental Settings)**, where the authors discuss the dataset in detail. Here, they refer to the **XMusic dataset**, which is described as a large-scale dataset composed of song-to-song interactions. The authors provide statistics about the dataset, including the number of songs (318K), the number of interactions (5.4M), average interactions per song (17.26), and density (0.005%).

The authors also mention that the dataset was developed based on collaborative signals collected over 90 days from various scenarios, which gives context to its creation. However, they note that due to copyright issues, they cannot publish the dataset.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. However, since the authors explicitly state that they cannot publish the XMusic dataset, there may not be a formal citation available. Instead, I will note that the dataset is referenced in the context of their work and is not publicly available.

In summary, I have identified the following dataset from the paper:

1. **XMusic Dataset**: A large-scale dataset composed of song-to-song interactions, with 318K songs and 5.4M interactions.

Since there is no formal citation for the XMusic dataset due to copyright restrictions, I will document this information accordingly.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format for clarity and future reference.
