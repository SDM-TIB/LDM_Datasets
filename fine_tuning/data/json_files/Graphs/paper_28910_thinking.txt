To extract datasets from the research paper titled "RiskNet: Neural Risk Assessment in Networks of Unreliable Resources" by Krzysztof Rusek et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, but I need to look for specific datasets used in the experiments or simulations.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly the part where the authors describe their experimental setup. Here, they mention that the GNN (Graph Neural Network) is trained using random graphs generated with the Barabási–Albert model. This indicates that the authors used synthetic datasets created from this model for their training.

I will also look for any references to real-world datasets or benchmarks in the **experiments section**. The authors mention using topologies retrieved from the SNDLib library, which suggests that they utilized datasets from this source for their evaluations.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper cites the SNDLib library, which is a well-known repository for network topologies. I will ensure to include the citation for this library as it is a significant source of datasets used in their research.

The citation for the SNDLib library is:
> SNDLib: A Library for Network Topology Generation. Available at: http://sndlib.zib.de.

Additionally, I will note that the authors generated synthetic datasets based on the Barabási–Albert model, but since this is a method of generating data rather than a specific dataset, I will not include a citation for it.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for the datasets used in the research. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets referenced in the paper.
