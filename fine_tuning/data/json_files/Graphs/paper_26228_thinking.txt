To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Devign: Effective Vulnerability Identification by Learning Comprehensive Program Semantics via Graph Neural Networks" by Yaqin Zhou et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any mention of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors compiled manually labeled datasets from four large-scale open-source C projects. This suggests that there are specific datasets that I need to look for.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section, where the authors discuss the challenges of vulnerability identification and the need for high-quality datasets. They mention that they collected and labeled data from four popular C libraries, which is a strong indication that these libraries are the datasets of interest.

I will then focus on the **data preparation** section, which provides detailed information about how the datasets were created. The authors explicitly list the four projects used to compile the datasets: **Linux Kernel**, **QEMU**, **Wireshark**, and **FFmpeg**. This section also describes the process of gathering raw data and labeling it, which is crucial for understanding the datasets' context.

In the **results** section, the authors present statistics about the datasets, including the number of commits, vulnerable function commits (VFCs), and non-VFCs for each project. This information will help me describe the datasets more comprehensively.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets. However, since the datasets are derived from well-known open-source projects, I will provide citations for the original repositories or documentation of these projects:

1. **Linux Kernel**: 
   > Torvalds, Linus. "Linux Kernel." [Linux Kernel Archives](https://www.kernel.org/).

2. **QEMU**: 
   > Bellard, Fabrice. "QEMU: Open Source Processor Emulator." [QEMU Official Site](https://www.qemu.org/).

3. **Wireshark**: 
   > The Wireshark Team. "Wireshark." [Wireshark Official Site](https://www.wireshark.org/).

4. **FFmpeg**: 
   > FFmpeg Developers. "FFmpeg." [FFmpeg Official Site](https://ffmpeg.org/).

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the names of the datasets, their descriptions, and the full citations for each dataset. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately represent the datasets used in the research paper.
