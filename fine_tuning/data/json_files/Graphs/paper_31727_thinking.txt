To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Present-Biased Lobbyists in Linear Quadratic Stochastic Differential Games" by Ali Lazrak et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will look for any references to data sources or datasets used in the analysis.

Next, I will examine the **main body of the paper**, particularly focusing on sections that discuss the model, experiments, or results. I will look for any specific datasets that the authors might have used to validate their findings or to illustrate their models. If the authors mention any datasets, I will take note of their names, descriptions, and any relevant details provided.

If the paper includes a **section dedicated to datasets**, I will pay close attention to it, as it will likely contain the most comprehensive information about the datasets used in the research. This section may include details such as the size of the datasets, the type of data collected, and how the data was used in the analysis.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research. I will ensure that I capture the complete citation format as presented in the paper.

If the datasets are not explicitly cited in the references, I will look for any related works or foundational papers that might have introduced the datasets. This may involve searching for the original sources of the datasets mentioned in the paper.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This will provide a clear and organized summary of the datasets used in the research.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset information for presentation or further processing, ensuring that it is accurate and complete.
