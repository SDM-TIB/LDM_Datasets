To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Investigating the Role of Negatives in Contrastive Representation Learning" by Jordan T. Ash et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract discusses the use of noise contrastive learning in both NLP and vision tasks, which suggests that datasets from these domains may be referenced. I will look for any specific dataset names or descriptions.

Next, I will proceed to the **experiments section** (Section 4), where the authors typically provide detailed information about the datasets used for their experiments. I will look for subsections that explicitly mention datasets, such as "Datasets" or "Experimental Setup."

In the experiments section, I will identify the datasets used for both the NLP and vision tasks. The paper mentions the **Wiki-3029 dataset** for the NLP experiments and discusses its characteristics, such as the number of sentences and articles. For the vision experiments, I will look for datasets like **SVHN** and **CIFAR-10**, which are commonly used in contrastive learning studies.

Once I have identified the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access the datasets.

For the **Wiki-3029 dataset**, I will find the citation provided by Saunshi et al. (2019), as it is the source of this dataset. For **SVHN** and **CIFAR-10**, I will look for their respective original papers to ensure accurate citations.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each entry is clearly documented.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format, ready for further processing or review.
