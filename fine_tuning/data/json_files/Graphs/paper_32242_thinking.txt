To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Graph Contrastive Topic Model" by Zheheng Luo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on "several benchmark datasets," which indicates that datasets are indeed used in their research. I will look for specific names of these datasets in these sections.

Next, I will proceed to the **experiments section** (Section 4) where the authors typically provide detailed information about the datasets used. In **Section 4.1**, the authors explicitly list the datasets they used for their experiments. I will carefully note down the names of these datasets along with any relevant details provided, such as the number of documents, vocabulary size, and any specific characteristics that define each dataset.

The paper mentions three datasets:
1. **20 Newsgroups (20NG)**: A dataset consisting of approximately 20,000 newsgroup documents, organized into 20 different newsgroups.
2. **IMDB movie reviews**: A dataset containing 50,000 movie reviews, which are labeled as positive or negative.
3. **Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS) papers**: A collection of research papers from the NIPS conference spanning from 1987 to 2017.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets easily.

The full citations I will extract are:
- For **20 Newsgroups**:

- For **IMDB movie reviews**:
  > Maas, A. L., Daly, R. E., Pham, P. T., Huang, D., Ng, A. Y., & Potts, C. (2011). Learning Word Vectors for Sentiment Analysis. In Proceedings of the 49th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies (pp. 142â€“150). https://aclanthology.org/P11-1015

- For **NIPS papers**:
  > Benhamner, M. (2018). Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS) papers from 1987 to 2017. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/benhamner/nips-papers

Now that I have gathered the dataset names and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly presents each dataset along with its citation. This will ensure that the datasets are properly documented and can be referenced in future work.
