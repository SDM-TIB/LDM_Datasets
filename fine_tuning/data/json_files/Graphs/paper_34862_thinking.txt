To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SSP-GNN: Learning to Track via Bilevel Optimization" by Griffin Golias et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets used in the study.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses a graph-based tracking formulation and mentions evaluating the algorithm on simulated scenarios, which suggests that there may be datasets involved.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this section, the authors describe their methodology and the scenarios used for evaluation. They mention that the synthetic data is generated using **Stone Soup**, an open-source framework, which indicates that the data used for training and testing is synthetic rather than a publicly available dataset.

I will also check the **implementation details** to see if there are any references to specific datasets or data generation methods. The authors describe generating diverse scenarios with multiple targets using constant velocity and Ornstein-Uhlenbeck motion models, but they do not specify any external datasets.

Since the paper primarily uses synthetic data generated through a specific framework, I will note that the dataset is not a traditional dataset but rather a custom dataset created for the purpose of the experiments. Therefore, I will document this as follows:

1. **Synthetic Data from Stone Soup**: The authors generated synthetic data using the Stone Soup framework, which includes various scenarios with multiple targets and different motion models. This dataset is not publicly available but is created specifically for the experiments in this paper.

Finally, I will check the **References section** to see if there are any citations related to the Stone Soup framework or any other datasets mentioned. However, since the paper focuses on synthetic data, there may not be any traditional dataset citations.

In summary, I will compile the information about the dataset used in the paper, ensuring to include the relevant details and the context of its creation. The full citation for the Stone Soup framework will be noted as follows:

- **Stone Soup Framework**: 
  > Stone Soup: An open-source framework for generating synthetic data for tracking scenarios. Available at: https://github.com/dstl/Stone-Soup/

Now, I will prepare the dataset entry based on this information, ensuring that I clearly indicate the nature of the dataset and its source.
