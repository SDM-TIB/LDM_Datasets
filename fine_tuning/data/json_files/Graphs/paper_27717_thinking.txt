To extract datasets from the research paper titled "REGINA - Reasoning Graph Convolutional Networks in Human Action Recognition" by Bruno Degardin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the experiments were conducted on "well-known action recognition datasets," which indicates that specific datasets will be discussed later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this case, the authors explicitly state that their experiments were conducted on the **NTU RGB+D dataset**. I will note down the details provided about this dataset, including its composition and characteristics.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide a detailed description of the NTU RGB+D dataset, stating that it consists of 56,880 video samples with 60 action classes, captured from 40 volunteers. This information is crucial for understanding the dataset's scope and application.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the NTU RGB+D dataset. The citation is as follows:
> A. Shahroudy, J. Liu, T.-T. Ng, and G. Wang. "NTU RGB+D: A large scale dataset for 3D human activity analysis." In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2016, pp. 1010â€“1019.

Since the paper primarily focuses on the NTU RGB+D dataset, I will ensure that I include this dataset in my final output.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring that I include the full citation as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the dataset used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
