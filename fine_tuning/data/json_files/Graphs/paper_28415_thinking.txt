To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Graph-Guided Network for Irregularly Sampled Multivariate Time Series" by Xiang Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any datasets mentioned. The authors state that they use RAINDROP to classify time series and interpret temporal dynamics on three healthcare and human activity datasets. This indicates that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for more details. The authors mention that they compare their method on three datasets, which suggests that these datasets will be explicitly named later in the paper.

I will then navigate to the **experiments section**, specifically **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors provide an overview of the datasets used. Here, they mention three datasets:

1. **P19 Dataset**: This dataset includes 38,803 patients monitored by 34 sensors, with a binary label representing the occurrence of sepsis. 

2. **P12 Dataset**: This dataset records temporal measurements of 36 sensors from 11,988 patients during their first 48-hour stay in the ICU, with labels based on hospitalization length.

3. **PAM Dataset**: This dataset contains 5,333 segments from 8 activities of daily living measured by 17 sensors.

Next, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For the **P19 Dataset**:
  > Reyna, M., Josef, C. S., Jeter, R., Shashikumar, S. P., Westover, M. B., Nemati, S., Clifford, G. D., & Sharma, A. (2020). Early prediction of sepsis from clinical data: The PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology Challenge 2019. *Critical Care Medicine*, 48(2), 210-217.

- For the **P12 Dataset**:
  > Goldberger, A. L., Nunes Amaral, L. A., Glass, L., Hausdorff, J. M., Ivanov, P. C., Mark, R. G., Mietus, J. E., Moody, G. B., Peng, C. K., & Stanley, H. E. (2000). PhysioBank, PhysioToolkit, and PhysioNet: components of a new research resource for complex physiologic signals. *Circulation*, 101(23), E215-E220.

- For the **PAM Dataset**:
  > Reiss, A., & Stricker, D. (2012). Introducing a new benchmarked dataset for activity monitoring. In *Proceedings of the 2012 International Symposium on Wearable Computers* (pp. 108-109).

Now that I have identified the datasets and their full citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
