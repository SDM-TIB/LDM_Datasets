To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A peridynamic-informed deep learning model for brittle damage prediction" by R. Eghbalpoor and A. Sheidaei, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, results, and discussion sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, but I will focus on sections that typically contain detailed information about datasets.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss various high-fidelity numerical techniques and mention the use of machine learning models trained on high-fidelity simulations or experimental datasets. However, they do not specify any datasets at this point.

Next, I will examine the **methods section**. Here, the authors describe the peridynamic-informed neural network (PD-INN) and its implementation. They mention using benchmark cases for validation but do not explicitly name any datasets.

Moving on to the **results section**, the authors present findings from various case studies, including plates with pre-existing cracks and circular cutouts. They describe the training dataset used for the PD-INN, which consists of true deformations of a rectangular plate under tension with different pre-crack lengths and positions. However, they do not provide a formal citation for this dataset.

In the **discussion section**, the authors reflect on the performance of the PD-INN model and its validation against high-fidelity techniques. They mention comparisons with results obtained from direct numerical methods and the Extended Finite Element Method (XFEM), but again, no specific datasets are cited.

Since the paper does not provide explicit dataset names or citations, I will need to look at the **references section** to identify any relevant studies that may have provided datasets used in their experiments. 

Upon reviewing the references, I find that several papers are cited, but none of them appear to be datasets themselves. The authors reference various methodologies and previous works, but they do not provide a specific dataset citation.

In conclusion, while the paper discusses the use of datasets for training and validation, it does not explicitly name or cite any datasets. Therefore, I will note that the authors utilized a training dataset consisting of true deformations of a rectangular plate under tension with various pre-crack lengths and positions, but without a formal citation, I cannot provide a complete reference for it.

I will summarize my findings as follows:
1. **Training Dataset**: True deformations of a rectangular plate under tension with different pre-crack lengths and positions. (No formal citation provided in the paper).

Since no formal dataset citations are available, I will document this limitation in my final output.
