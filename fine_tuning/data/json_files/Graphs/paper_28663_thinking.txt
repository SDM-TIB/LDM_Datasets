To extract datasets from the research paper titled "AutoGEL: An Automated Graph Neural Network with Explicit Link Information" by Zhili Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that "Experimental results on benchmark data sets demonstrate the superiority of AutoGEL on several tasks." This indicates that there are datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4), where the authors typically describe the datasets used in their experiments. In **Section 4.1 (Experimental Setting)**, the authors specify the datasets used for different tasks, including link prediction (LP) on homogeneous graphs and knowledge graphs, as well as node and graph classification tasks.

The datasets mentioned in the paper are:

1. **Homogeneous Graphs for Link Prediction**:
   - **NS Dataset**: Used for link prediction, with specific details provided in Table 6.
   - **Power Dataset**: Another dataset for link prediction, also detailed in Table 6.
   - **Router Dataset**: Included in the link prediction experiments.
   - **C.ele Dataset**: Used for link prediction.
   - **USAir Dataset**: Another dataset for link prediction.
   - **Yeast Dataset**: Included in the experiments.
   - **PB Dataset**: Used for link prediction.

2. **Knowledge Graphs for Link Prediction**:
   - **FB15k-237**: A benchmark knowledge graph used for evaluation.
   - **WN18RR**: Another knowledge graph utilized in the experiments.

3. **Node Classification**:
   - **Cora Dataset**: A popular citation network used for node classification.
   - **CiteSeer Dataset**: Another citation network included in the experiments.
   - **PubMed Dataset**: Used for node classification tasks.

4. **Graph Classification**:
   - **IMDB-B Dataset**: A dataset for graph classification.
   - **IMDB-M Dataset**: Another dataset used for graph classification.
   - **MUTAG Dataset**: Included in the graph classification experiments.
   - **PROTEINS Dataset**: Another dataset for graph classification.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, the citations for the datasets might look like this:

- **NS Dataset**: 
  > Newman, M. E. J. (2006). Finding community structure in networks using the eigenvectors of matrices. *Physical Review E*, 74(3), 036104.

- **Power Dataset**: 
  > Watts, D. J., & Strogatz, S. H. (1998). Collective dynamics of ‘small-world’ networks. *Nature*, 393(6684), 440-442.

- **FB15k-237**: 
  > Toutanova, K., & Chen, D. (2015). Observed versus latent features for knowledge base and text inference. In *Proceedings of the 3rd Workshop on Continuous Vector Space Models and their Compositionality* (pp. 57-66).

- **Cora Dataset**: 
  > Sen, P., Namata, G. E., Bilgic, M., Getoor, L., Galligher, J., & Eliassi-Rad, T. (2008). Collective classification in network data. *AI Magazine*, 29(3), 93-93.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will facilitate downstream processing and ensure that the datasets are easily accessible for future research.
