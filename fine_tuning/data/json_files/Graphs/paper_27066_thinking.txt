To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CROCS: Clustering and Retrieval of Cardiac Signals Based on Patient Disease Class, Sex, and Age" by Dani Kiyasseh, Tingting Zhu, and David Clifton, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study and may mention datasets used for evaluation. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of searching and extracting information from clinical databases, which suggests that datasets are integral to their research. However, I need to locate specific dataset names and details.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experimental design)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they describe two datasets:

1. **Chapman Dataset**: This dataset consists of 12-lead ECG recordings from 10,646 patients, with cardiac arrhythmia labels grouped into four major classes. It includes patient sex and age information and is split into training, validation, and test sets.

2. **PTB-XL Dataset**: This dataset contains 12-lead ECG recordings from 18,885 patients, with disease labels grouped into five major classes. Similar to the Chapman dataset, it includes patient sex and age information and is also split into training, validation, and test sets.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **Chapman Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Jianwei Zheng, Jianming Zhang, Sidy Danioko, Hai Yao, Hangyuan Guo, and Cyril Rakovski. *A 12-lead electrocardiogram database for arrhythmia research covering more than 10,000 patients*. Scientific Data, 7(1):1â€“8, 2020.

- For the **PTB-XL Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Patrick Wagner, Nils Strodthoff, Ralf-Dieter Bousseljot, Wojciech Samek, and Tobias Schaeffter. *PTB-XL, a large publicly available electrocardiography dataset*, 2020.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets, I will prepare to compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
