To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Contrastive Learning for Predicting Cancer Prognosis Using Gene Expression Values" by Anchen Sun et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions using data from **The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)**, which indicates that this is a primary dataset used in the study. The introduction further elaborates on the use of TCGA data for training classifiers and Cox models, confirming its significance.

Next, I will look into the **Methods section**, specifically **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the datasets used. Here, they mention:

1. **TCGA Dataset**: This dataset includes RNA-seq and clinical data for 19 types of cancer, with expression values for 20,531 genes across 11,069 patients. The authors note that this dataset has been normalized and curated by the PanCancer Atlas consortium.

2. **CPTAC-3 Dataset**: This dataset is used for validation and contains RNA-seq and clinical data for lung cancer (LUAD and LUSC). The authors specify that it includes 206 LUAD patients and 102 LUSC patients.

3. **DKFZ Dataset**: Another validation dataset, which includes RNA-seq and clinical data for 105 prostate cancer patients.

4. **Breast Cancer Microarray Datasets**: A collection of 6 datasets used to train and test Cox models, which includes expression data for 13,235 genes and distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) time for 687 estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) patients.

In the **References section**, I will find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **TCGA dataset**, the citation is:
  > Hoadley, K. A. et al. *Cell-of-origin patterns dominate the molecular classification of 10,000 tumors from 33 types of cancer*. Cell 173, 291–304 (2018).

- For the **CPTAC-3 dataset**, the citation is:

- For the **DKFZ dataset**, the citation is:
  > Gerhauser, C. et al. *Molecular evolution of early-onset prostate cancer identifies molecular risk markers and clinical trajectories*. Cancer Cell 34, 996–1011 (2018).

- For the **breast cancer microarray datasets**, the citation is:
  > van Vliet, M. H. et al. *Pooling breast cancer datasets has a synergetic effect on classification performance and improves signature stability*. BMC Genomics 9, 1–22 (2008).

Now, I will compile this information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
