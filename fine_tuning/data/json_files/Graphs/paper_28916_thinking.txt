To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Graph Convolution-Based Deep Reinforcement Learning for Multi-Agent Decision-Making in Mixed Traffic Environments" by Qi Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of different Graph Reinforcement Learning (GRL) methods in interactive driving scenarios, which suggests that datasets may be involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors mention the need for intelligent multi-agent decision-making technology for autonomous vehicles. They reference previous studies and methods, which may lead to specific datasets used in their experiments.

In the **methodology section**, particularly under the **simulation environment**, the authors mention that the traffic scenarios and experiments are constructed based on the SUMO platform. This indicates that they may have used specific datasets or simulation environments that are standard in the field.

I will also look for any explicit mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. If the authors refer to specific datasets used for training or testing their models, I will note these down.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** for full citations. The paper mentions the use of the "MAgent" platform and the SUMO platform, which are important for understanding the context of the datasets used.

1. **MAgent Platform**: This is a multi-agent reinforcement learning platform that allows for the simulation of various scenarios. The citation for this platform is:
   > Z. Qiao, K. Muelling, J. Dolan, P. Palanisamy, and P. Mudalige. "Pomdp and hierarchical options mdp with continuous actions for autonomous driving at intersections." In 2018 21st International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC). IEEE, 2018, pp. 2377–2382.

2. **SUMO Platform**: The authors mention that their traffic scenarios are based on the SUMO platform. The citation for this platform is:
   > P. A. Lopez, M. Behrisch, L. Bieker-Walz, J. Erdmann, Y.-P. Flötteröd, R. Hilbrich, L. Lücken, J. Rummel, P. Wagner, and E. Wießner. "Microscopic traffic simulation using SUMO." In The 21st IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems. IEEE, November 2018, pp. 2575–2582.

Finally, I will compile the identified datasets and their citations into a structured format for further processing. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their proper citations.
