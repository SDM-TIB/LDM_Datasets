To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "ESIHGNN: Event-State Interactions Infused Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network for Conversational Emotion Recognition" by Xupeng Zha et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on **four publicly available CER datasets**, which suggests that specific datasets will be listed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experiments)**, where the authors provide details about the datasets used for evaluation. They mention four datasets: 

1. **IEMOCAP**: This dataset is described as an interactive emotional dyadic motion capture database, which includes dialogues with emotional annotations.

2. **MELD**: This dataset is characterized as a multimodal multi-party dataset for emotion recognition in conversations, containing various emotional expressions across different contexts.

3. **EmoryNLP**: This dataset is utilized for emotion detection on TV show transcripts, providing a rich source of conversational data with emotional labels.

4. **DailyDialog**: This dataset is a manually labeled multi-turn dialogue dataset, which includes diverse conversational scenarios and emotional annotations.

To ensure accuracy, I will check the **References section** for the full citations of these datasets:

- For **IEMOCAP**, the citation is:

- For **EmoryNLP**, the citation is:
  > Sayyed M. Zahiri and Jinho D. Choi. *Emotion Detection on TV Show Transcripts with Sequence-Based Convolutional Neural Networks*. In Proceedings of the AAAI, pp. 44–52, 2018.

- For **DailyDialog**, the citation is:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their full citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
