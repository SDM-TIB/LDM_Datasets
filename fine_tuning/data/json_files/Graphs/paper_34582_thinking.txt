To extract datasets from the research paper titled "GraphAny: A Foundation Model for Node Classification on Any Graph" by Jianan Zhao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the contributions and mentions the use of various datasets for evaluation, which is a good starting point.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention a total of **31 node classification datasets** collected from sources like PyG, DGL, and OGB. I will look for specific names and details of these datasets.

In **Section 4.1 (Experimental Setup)**, the authors provide a list of datasets along with their characteristics, such as the number of labeled nodes, feature dimensions, and the number of classes. This section is crucial for gathering detailed information about each dataset.

I will also check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The authors often cite the original papers or sources where these datasets can be found. This is important for providing proper attribution.

The datasets mentioned in the paper include:

1. **Cora**: A citation network dataset with 2708 nodes, 5429 edges, and 7 classes.
   - Citation: McCallum, A., et al. (2000). "Automating the Construction of Internet Portals with Machine Learning." *Information Retrieval*.

2. **Citeseer**: A citation network dataset with 3327 nodes, 4732 edges, and 6 classes.

I will compile this information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly documented with its characteristics and citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
