To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An Evaluation of Knowledge Graph Embeddings for Autonomous Driving Data: Experience and Practice" by Ruwan Wickramarachchi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant details, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate knowledge graph embeddings using datasets from Aptiv and Lyft, which suggests that these datasets are crucial for the research.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Scene Knowledge Graphs)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for generating knowledge graphs. Here, they explicitly mention two datasets:

1. **NuScenes Dataset**: The authors describe it as containing 850 driving segments with 34,149 samples, where each sample is associated with various detected objects and events categorized into 23 categories.

2. **Lyft-Level5 Dataset**: This dataset is mentioned as containing 180 driving segments with 22,680 samples, categorized into 9 object and event categories.

To confirm the details and obtain full citations, I will check the **References section** of the paper. The citations for these datasets are:

- For the **NuScenes Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Caesar, H., Bankiti, V., Lang, A. H., Vora, S., Liong, V. E., Xu, Q., Krishnan, A., Pan, Y., Balakrishnan, K., Beijbom, O. (2019). *nuscenes: A multimodal dataset for autonomous driving*. ArXiv:1903.11027.

- For the **Lyft-Level5 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Kesten, R., Usman, M., Houston, J., Pandya, T., Nadhamuni, K., Ferreira, A., Yuan, M., Low, B., Jain, A., Ondruska, P., Omari, S., Shah, S., Kulkarni, A., Kazakova, A., Tao, C., Platinsky, L., Jiang, W., and Shet, V. (2019). *Lyft level 5 av dataset 2019*. Retrieved from https://level5.lyft.com/dataset/.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets, ensuring to include their names, descriptions, and full citations. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research, which is essential for any further analysis or replication of the study.
