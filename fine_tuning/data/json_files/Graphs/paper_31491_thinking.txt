To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Two-level Graph Network for Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning" by Hao Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that experiments were conducted on "three popular benchmark datasets," which indicates that specific datasets will be discussed later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the relevant information about datasets is found in **section IV (Experiment)**. Here, the authors explicitly list the datasets used for evaluation:

1. **MiniImageNet**: This dataset is described as a subset of ImageNet containing 100 classes. It is commonly used for few-shot learning tasks.

2. **CUB200-2011**: This dataset is noted for its fine-grained image classification task with 200 classes, making it suitable for evaluating few-shot learning methods.

3. **CIFAR100**: This dataset consists of 60,000 images across 100 classes and is another standard benchmark for few-shot learning.

The paper also provides details on how these datasets are split for training and testing, which is important for understanding their application in the experiments.

Now, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

- For **MiniImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Vinyals, O., Blundell, C., Lillicrap, T., & Wierstra, D. (2016). Matching networks for one shot learning. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS).

- For **CUB200-2011**, the citation is:
  > Wah, C., Branson, S., Welinder, P., Perona, P., & Miller, D. (2011). The Caltech-UCSD Birds-200-2011 Dataset. In Proceedings of the Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR).

- For **CIFAR100**, the citation is:
  > Krizhevsky, A. (2009). Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images. Technical Report, University of Toronto.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets and their citations clearly, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its full citation for future reference or use.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that is ready for review or further processing.
