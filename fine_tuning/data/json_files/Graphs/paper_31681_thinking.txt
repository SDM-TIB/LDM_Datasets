To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Effective Open Intent Classification with K-center Contrastive Learning and Adjustable Decision Boundary" by Xiaokang Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental setup section**, where the authors typically provide detailed information about the datasets used. In this section, they mention three datasets:

1. **BANKING Dataset**: This dataset is described as a fine-grained dataset in the banking domain, containing 77 intents and 13,083 customer service queries.

2. **OOS Dataset**: This dataset is for intent classification and out-of-scope prediction, consisting of 150 intents, 22,500 in-domain queries, and 1,200 out-of-domain queries.

3. **StackOverflow Dataset**: Originally released on Kaggle, this dataset contains 3,370,528 technical question titles, with the processed version used in the paper having 20 different classes and 1,000 samples for each class.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For the **BANKING Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Casanueva, I., Temˇcinas, T., Gerz, D., Henderson, M., & Vulić, I. (2020). Efficient intent detection with dual sentence encoders. arXiv preprint arXiv:2003.04807.

- For the **OOS Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Larson, S., Mahendran, A., Peper, J. J., Clarke, C., Lee, A., Hill, P., Kummerfeld, J. K., Leach, K., Laurenzano, M. A., Tang, L., et al. (2019). An evaluation dataset for intent classification and out-of-scope prediction. arXiv preprint arXiv:1909.02027.

- For the **StackOverflow Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Xu, J., Wang, P., Tian, G., Xu, B., Zhao, J., Wang, F., & Hao, H. (2015). Short text clustering via convolutional neural networks. In Proceedings of the 1st Workshop on Vector Space Modeling for Natural Language Processing (pp. 62-69).

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that highlights each dataset's name, description, and citation. This will ensure that I have accurately captured all necessary details for future reference or processing.
