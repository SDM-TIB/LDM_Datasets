To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Can Machines Resonate with Humans? Evaluating the Emotional and Empathic Comprehension of LMs" by Muhammad Arslan Manzoor et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the research focus and any datasets that might be referenced. The abstract mentions the collection of story pairs in the Urdu language, which suggests that there is a dataset related to empathy and emotional comprehension.

Next, I will look for specific sections that typically contain dataset information, such as **section 2 (Dataset and Error Analysis)**. In this section, the authors discuss the **EmpathicStories dataset**, which was created by Shen et al. (2023). This dataset consists of 1,500 unique stories and 2,000 story pairs, split into training, development, and testing sets. The details provided include the distribution of the dataset across different similarity ranges, which is crucial for understanding its structure.

Additionally, the authors mention the collection of a **new Urdu dataset** to explore cultural impacts on empathy similarity labeling. This dataset was generated using GPT-4o and consists of 300 story pairs, which are also annotated for similarity scores.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. **EmpathicStories Dataset**:
   - Citation:
     > Jocelyn Shen, Maarten Sap, Pedro Colon-Hernandez, Hae Park, and Cynthia Breazeal. *Modeling empathic similarity in personal narratives*. In Proceedings of the 2023 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 6237â€“6252, Singapore. Association for Computational Linguistics.

2. **Urdu Dataset**:
   - Since the Urdu dataset is newly constructed and generated using GPT-4o, it may not have a formal citation yet. However, I can note that it was created for the purpose of this research and is based on the themes and methodologies discussed in the paper.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for the EmpathicStories dataset and a note regarding the Urdu dataset's creation for clarity.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for further processing or review.
