To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Revisiting Architecture-aware Knowledge Distillation: Smaller Models and Faster Search" by Taehyeon Kim et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and while it may not explicitly mention datasets, it sets the context for the experiments conducted.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology and experiments sections**. These sections typically contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used for training and evaluation. I will look for any specific mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

In this paper, I will pay particular attention to **Table 2**, which summarizes the architectures searched by the TRADE framework and their performance results. This table may include references to datasets used for training or evaluation.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access the datasets.

For example, if the paper mentions using the **ImageNet dataset**, I would look for the citation that corresponds to it. The citation for ImageNet is typically:
> Olga Russakovsky, Jia Deng, Hao Sheng, et al. *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 115(3):211-252, 2015.

If the paper references any other datasets, such as CIFAR-10 or CIFAR-100, I would also retrieve their citations:
> Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. *CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets*. 2009.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, including their names, descriptions, and citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference.

Finally, I will ensure that each dataset entry includes the full citation, as this is essential for academic integrity and for readers who may wish to explore the datasets further.
