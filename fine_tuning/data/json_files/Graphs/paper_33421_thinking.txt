To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CrossBind: Collaborative Cross-Modal Identification of Protein Nucleic-Acid-Binding Residues" by Linglin Jing et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their method on DNA and RNA datasets, which indicates that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically looking for any mentions of datasets used for training and testing. In this section, the authors explicitly state that they utilized two benchmark datasets: **DNA 129** and **RNA 117**. They also mention an additional independent testing set: **DNA 181**. 

I will then gather detailed descriptions of these datasets from the text. The authors provide the following information:

1. **DNA 129 Dataset**: This dataset consists of 573 training proteins and 129 testing proteins, obtained from the BioLip database. The binding residue is identified based on specific atomic distance criteria.

2. **RNA 117 Dataset**: This dataset includes 495 training proteins and 117 testing proteins, also sourced from the BioLip database. Similar binding residue identification criteria are applied.

3. **DNA 181 Dataset**: This independent testing set contains 181 proteins whose structures were predicted by AlphaFold2.

Now, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **DNA 129 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yang, J., Roy, A., & Zhang, Y. (2012). BioLiP: a semi-manually curated database for biologically relevant ligand–protein interactions. *Nucleic Acids Research*, 41(D1), D1096–D1103.

- For the **RNA 117 Dataset**, the citation is the same as for the DNA 129 dataset, as both datasets are sourced from the BioLip database:
  > Yang, J., Roy, A., & Zhang, Y. (2012). BioLiP: a semi-manually curated database for biologically relevant ligand–protein interactions. *Nucleic Acids Research*, 41(D1), D1096–D1103.

- For the **DNA 181 Dataset**, the citation is not explicitly mentioned in the text, but it is implied to be part of the same BioLip database.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes the full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details regarding the datasets used in the research.
