To extract datasets from the research paper titled "L-DAWA: Layer-wise Divergence Aware Weight Aggregation in Federated Self-Supervised Visual Representation Learning" by Yasar Abbas Ur Rehman et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions experiments conducted on **CIFAR-10/100 and Tiny ImageNet datasets**, indicating that these are the datasets used in their research.

Next, I will look for specific details about these datasets in the **experimental setup section**. Here, the authors describe how they conducted experiments on **CIFAR-10/100 and Tiny ImageNet**. They also mention generating Non-iid versions of these datasets based on actual class labels using a Dirichlet coefficient, which is relevant for understanding the dataset's structure and usage in their experiments.

In the **references section**, I will search for full citations related to these datasets. The CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets are well-known, and their citations are typically included in the literature. The citation for CIFAR-10 is:
> Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton, et al. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. 2009.

For CIFAR-100, the citation is the same as CIFAR-10 since they are part of the same dataset collection:
> Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton, et al. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. 2009.

The Tiny ImageNet dataset is derived from the original ImageNet dataset and is often cited as follows:
> Yuval Netzer, Tao Wang, Adam Coates, Alessandro Bissacco, Bo Wu, and Andrew Y. Ng. *Reading Digits in Natural Images with Unsupervised Feature Learning*. In Proceedings of the Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS), 2011.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use.

In summary, the datasets extracted from the paper are:
1. **CIFAR-10**
   - Citation: Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton, et al. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. 2009.
   
2. **CIFAR-100**
   - Citation: Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton, et al. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. 2009.

3. **Tiny ImageNet**
   - Citation: Yuval Netzer, Tao Wang, Adam Coates, Alessandro Bissacco, Bo Wu, and Andrew Y. Ng. *Reading Digits in Natural Images with Unsupervised Feature Learning*. In Proceedings of the Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS), 2011.

With this information, I can now proceed to format the dataset entries as needed.
