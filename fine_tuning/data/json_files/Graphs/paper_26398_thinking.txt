To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Linking Bank Clients using Graph Neural Networks Powered by Rich Transactional Data" by Valentina Shumovskaia et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method using data provided by a large European bank, which suggests that a specific dataset is involved.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for any further details about the dataset. The introduction discusses the nature of the data, specifically user transactions and money transfers, but does not provide a formal name for the dataset.

In **section 2 (Problem and Data)**, the authors describe the dataset in detail. They mention that the dataset consists of user transactions and money transfers over five years from a large European bank, resulting in a graph with 86 million nodes and about 4 billion edges. However, they do not provide a specific name for this dataset.

Since the dataset is derived from a proprietary source (a large European bank), it may not have a formal citation like publicly available datasets. Therefore, I will note this dataset as "Proprietary Dataset from a Large European Bank" and include a description of its contents.

I will also check the **References section** to see if there are any citations related to the dataset or methodologies that could provide context. However, since the dataset is proprietary, it is unlikely to have a formal citation.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring to include the dataset description and any relevant details. The dataset entry will be as follows:

- **Dataset Name**: Proprietary Dataset from a Large European Bank
- **Description**: This dataset consists of user transactions and money transfers between clients over five years, resulting in a graph with 86 million nodes and approximately 4 billion edges. Each transaction is described by a timestamp, amount, and currency.

Since there is no formal citation for this proprietary dataset, I will note that it is derived from internal bank data and does not have a publicly available reference.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entry for review or further processing.
