To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Adaptive Multi-layer Contrastive Graph Neural Networks" by Shuhao Shi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that the experiments were conducted on "four established graph benchmarks," which indicates that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Dataset Description)**, where the authors provide a detailed list of the datasets used in their experiments. Here, I will find the following datasets explicitly mentioned:

1. **Cora**: A widely used citation network dataset with 2,708 nodes, 5,429 edges, 1,433 features, and 7 classes.
2. **Citeseer**: Another citation network dataset with 3,327 nodes, 4,732 edges, 3,703 features, and 6 classes.
3. **Pubmed**: A larger citation network dataset with 19,717 nodes, 44,338 edges, 500 features, and 3 classes.
4. **DBLP**: A co-authorship multi-dimensional graph dataset with 17,716 nodes, 105,734 edges, 1,639 features, and 4 classes.
5. **Coauthor-CS**: A co-authorship graph dataset with 18,333 nodes, 81,894 edges, 6,805 features, and 15 classes.
6. **Coauthor-Physics**: Another co-authorship graph dataset with 34,493 nodes, 247,962 edges, 8,415 features, and 5 classes.
7. **Amazon-Computers**: A dataset representing co-buy relationships with 13,752 nodes, 245,861 edges, 767 features, and 10 classes.
8. **Amazon-Photo**: Similar to the Amazon-Computers dataset, with 7,650 nodes, 119,081 edges, 745 features, and 8 classes.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
