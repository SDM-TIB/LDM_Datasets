To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ARCL: Enhancing Contrastive Learning with Augmentation-Robust Representations" by Xuyang Zhao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to find any references to datasets. The abstract mentions conducting experiments on several datasets, which indicates that there are datasets to be identified.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 6) where the authors describe their experimental setup. Here, they mention using **CIFAR-10** for training the representation and evaluating it on various downstream datasets. The downstream datasets include:

1. **FGVC Aircraft**: This dataset is referenced in the context of evaluating the transferability of the learned representations.
2. **Caltech-101**: Another dataset mentioned for testing the performance of the model.
3. **Stanford Cars**: This dataset is also included in the evaluation.
4. **CIFAR-100**: Similar to CIFAR-10, this dataset is used for testing.
5. **DTD (Describable Textures Dataset)**: Mentioned as one of the datasets for evaluation.
6. **Oxford 102 Flowers**: This dataset is included in the evaluation process.
7. **Food-101**: Another dataset used for testing the model's performance.
8. **Oxford-IIIT Pets**: This dataset is also referenced for evaluation.

In the **References section**, I will look for full citations for these datasets to ensure proper documentation. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- **CIFAR-10**: 
  > Alex Krizhevsky. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009.

- **FGVC Aircraft**: 
  > Sanjeev Arora, et al. *Fine-Grained Visual Classification of Aircraft*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2013.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations to ensure that all datasets are properly documented and ready for further processing or review.
