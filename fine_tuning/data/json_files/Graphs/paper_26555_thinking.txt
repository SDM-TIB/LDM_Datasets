To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CoMoGCN: Coherent Motion Aware Trajectory Prediction with Graph Representation" by Yuying Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on several trajectory prediction benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors discuss the importance of modeling social interactions for accurate trajectory prediction. They mention that existing datasets do not provide coherent motion labels, indicating that they may be using specific datasets for their experiments.

In the **experiments section**, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets used for evaluation. The authors state that they evaluate their method on the **ETH** and **UCY** datasets, which are commonly used for trajectory prediction tasks. 

I will then check the **related works** and **methodology sections** to see if there are any additional details about how these datasets are utilized or modified. The authors mention that they added coherent motion cluster labels to these datasets, which is an important detail for understanding their contributions.

Now, I will consult the **references section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. **ETH Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Pellegrini, S., Ess, A., Schindler, K., & Van Gool, L. (2009). You'll never walk alone: Modeling social behavior for multi-target tracking. In Proceedings of the IEEE 12th International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 261–268.

2. **UCY Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Lerner, A., Chrysanthou, Y., & Lischinski, D. (2007). Crowds by example. In Computer Graphics Forum, 26(3), pages 655–664.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and includes the full citation as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
