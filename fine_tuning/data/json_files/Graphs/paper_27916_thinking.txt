To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Global and Local Contrastive Self-Supervised Learning for Semantic Segmentation of HR Remote Sensing Images" by Haifeng Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method on four RSI semantic segmentation datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **Section III (Experiments and Results)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they explicitly mention four datasets:

1. **ISPRS Potsdam Dataset**: This dataset consists of 38 high-resolution remote sensing aerial images with a spatial resolution of 5 cm and 4 spectral bands (red, blue, green, and NIR). It is annotated with six classes: low vegetation, trees, buildings, impervious surfaces, cars, and others.

2. **Deep Globe Land Cover Classification Dataset (DGLC)**: This dataset provides high-resolution sub-meter satellite images with a size of 2448Ã—2448 pixels, covering seven classes: urban, agriculture, rangeland, forest, water, barren, and unknown.

3. **Hubei Dataset**: Acquired from the Gaofen-2 satellite, this dataset covers the Hubei Province of China with a spatial resolution of 2 m and includes 10 classes: background, farmland, urban, rural areas, water, woodland, grassland, other artificial facilities, road, and others.

4. **Xiangtan Dataset**: Also from the Gaofen-2 satellite, this dataset covers the city of Xiangtan, China, with higher quality labels than the Hubei dataset, covering 9 classes: background, farmland, urban, rural areas, water, woodland, grassland, road, and others.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For the **ISPRS Potsdam Dataset**, the citation is:

For the **Deep Globe Land Cover Classification Dataset**, the citation is:

For the **Xiangtan Dataset**, the citation is:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
