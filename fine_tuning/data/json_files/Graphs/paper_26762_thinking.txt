To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Relational Reflection Entity Alignment" by Xin Mao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the experimental results are based on real-world datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention two main datasets:

1. **DBP15K**: This dataset consists of three cross-lingual datasets constructed from the multilingual version of DBpedia, specifically:
   - **DBPZH−EN**: Chinese to English
   - **DBPJA−EN**: Japanese to English
   - **DBPFR−EN**: French to English

2. **DWY100K**: This dataset includes two monolingual datasets:
   - **DWYWD**: DBpedia-Wikidata
   - **DWYYG**: DBpedia-YAGO3

The paper provides statistical data for these datasets, including the number of entities, relations, and triples, which confirms their significance in the experiments.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **DBP15K**, the citation is:
  > Zequn Sun, Wei Hu, and Chengkai Li. *Cross-Lingual Entity Alignment via Joint Attribute-Preserving Embedding*. In Proceedings of the 16th International Semantic Web Conference (ISWC), 2017.

- For **DWY100K**, the citation is:
  > Zequn Sun, Wei Hu, Qingheng Zhang, and Yuzhong Qu. *Bootstrapping Entity Alignment with Knowledge Graph Embedding*. In Proceedings of the 27th International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI), 2018.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation, ready for structured output or further processing.
