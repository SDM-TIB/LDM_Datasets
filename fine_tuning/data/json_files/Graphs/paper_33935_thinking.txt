To extract datasets from the research paper titled "L2GC: Lorentzian Linear Graph Convolutional Networks For Node Classification" by Qiuyu Liang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on standard citation network datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they list five datasets: **Cora**, **Citeseer**, **PubMed**, **Disease**, and **Airport**. I will take note of the context in which these datasets are used, including their characteristics and the specific tasks they are applied to.

The authors provide a table (Table 1) that summarizes the statistics of these datasets, including the number of nodes, edges, labels, features, and a measure of tree-likeness (Î´). This information is crucial for understanding the datasets' structure and relevance to the research.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The paper mentions that the Cora, Citeseer, and PubMed datasets are used with semi-supervised learning and cites the work by Sen et al. (2008) for these datasets. The Disease and Airport datasets are referenced with a citation to Zhang et al. (2021b).

Here are the full citations I will extract:

1. **Cora Dataset**:
   > Sen, P., Namata, G., Bilgic, M., Getoor, L., Galligher, J., & Eliassi-Rad, T. (2008). Collective classification in network data. *AI Magazine*, 29(3), 93-93.

2. **Citeseer Dataset**:
   > Sen, P., Namata, G., Bilgic, M., Getoor, L., Galligher, J., & Eliassi-Rad, T. (2008). Collective classification in network data. *AI Magazine*, 29(3), 93-93.

3. **PubMed Dataset**:
   > Sen, P., Namata, G., Bilgic, M., Getoor, L., Galligher, J., & Eliassi-Rad, T. (2008). Collective classification in network data. *AI Magazine*, 29(3), 93-93.

4. **Disease Dataset**:
   > Zhang, Y., Wang, X., Shi, C., Liu, N., & Song, G. (2021). Lorentzian graph convolutional networks. In *Proceedings of the Web Conference 2021* (pp. 1249-1261).

5. **Airport Dataset**:
   > Zhang, Y., Wang, X., Shi, C., Liu, N., & Song, G. (2021). Lorentzian graph convolutional networks. In *Proceedings of the Web Conference 2021* (pp. 1249-1261).

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described with its relevant statistics and full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I accurately capture all necessary details for each dataset mentioned in the paper.
