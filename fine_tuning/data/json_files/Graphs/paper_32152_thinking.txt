To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DCdetector: Dual Attention Contrastive Representation Learning for Time Series Anomaly Detection" by Yiyuan Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple time series anomaly detection benchmark datasets, indicating that datasets will be discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Benchmark Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they mention eight datasets, which I will summarize:

1. **MSL (Mars Science Laboratory dataset)**: Collected by NASA, this dataset contains sensor and actuator data from the Mars rover.
2. **SMAP (Soil Moisture Active Passive dataset)**: Another NASA dataset that presents soil samples and telemetry information from the Mars rover.
3. **PSM (Pooled Server Metrics dataset)**: A public dataset from eBay Server Machines with 25 dimensions.
4. **SMD (Server Machine Dataset)**: A dataset collected from an internet company compute cluster, containing resource utilization traces of 28 machines over five weeks.
5. **SWaT (Secure Water Treatment)**: A 51-dimensional sensor-based dataset collected from critical infrastructure systems.
6. **NIPS-TS-SWAN**: A multivariate time series benchmark extracted from solar photospheric vector magnetograms.
7. **NIPS-TS-GECCO**: A drinking water quality dataset for the Internet of Things, published in the 2018 genetic and evolutionary computation conference.
8. **UCR**: A univariate time series dataset provided by the Multi-dataset Time Series Anomaly Detection Competition of KDD2021, containing 250 sub-datasets from various natural sources.

After identifying these datasets, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, the citation for the **MSL dataset** is:
> Kyle Hundman, Valentino Constantinou, Christopher Laporte, Ian Colwell, and Tom Soderstrom. *Detecting spacecraft anomalies using lstms and nonparametric dynamic thresholding*. In Proceedings of the 24th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery & Data Mining, 2018, 387â€“395.

I will repeat this process for each dataset to ensure I have the correct citations.

Finally, I will compile all the extracted datasets along with their full citations into a structured format for easy reference and further use. This systematic approach ensures that I capture all necessary details while maintaining the integrity of the information presented in the research paper.
