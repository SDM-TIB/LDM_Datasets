To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Spatio-Temporal Contrastive Learning Enhanced GNNs for Session-based Recommendation" by Zhongwei Wan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may highlight key datasets used for evaluation. 

Next, I will examine the **experiments section**, particularly the part where the authors discuss the datasets used for their experiments. This section typically contains detailed information about the datasets, including their names, characteristics, and any relevant statistics.

In this paper, the authors mention that they conducted experiments on **six public benchmark datasets**: Tmall, Diginetica, Gowalla, RetailRocket, Nowplaying, and LastFM. I will take note of these datasets and look for specific details about each one, such as the number of items, clicks, training and testing data sizes, and average session lengths.

I will also check the **dataset statistics table** (Table 1) for comprehensive information about each dataset. This table includes the following details:

1. **Tmall**: 
   - Items: 40,728
   - Clicks: 818,479
   - Train: 351,268
   - Test: 25,898
   - Avg. length: 6.69

2. **Diginetica**: 
   - Items: 43,097
   - Clicks: 982,961
   - Train: 719,470
   - Test: 60,858
   - Avg. length: 5.12

3. **Gowalla**: 
   - Items: 29,510
   - Clicks: 1,122,788
   - Train: 419,200
   - Test: 155,332
   - Avg. length: 3.85

4. **RetailRocket**: 
   - Items: 36,968
   - Clicks: 710,586
   - Train: 433,648
   - Test: 15,132
   - Avg. length: 5.43

5. **Nowplaying**: 
   - Items: 60,417
   - Clicks: 1,367,963
   - Train: 825,304
   - Test: 89,824
   - Avg. length: 7.42

6. **LastFM**: 
   - Items: 38,615
   - Clicks: 3,835,706
   - Train: 2,837,330
   - Test: 672,833
   - Avg. length: 11.78

After gathering this information, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations may not always be explicitly stated in the paper, but they can often be found in the context of the datasets' descriptions or in the references to previous works that introduced these datasets.

Once I have the full citations, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described with its citation included. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring that all necessary information is included for each dataset.
