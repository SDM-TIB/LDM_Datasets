To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Principal Neighbourhood Aggregation for Graph Nets" by Gabriele Corso et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors compare their model on a novel benchmark and existing benchmarks from real-world domains, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments** section. In the introduction, the authors mention that they tested their model on "recently proposed real-world GNN benchmark datasets" and reference datasets from molecular chemistry and computer vision. This is a strong indication that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

In the **experiments section**, I will focus on any subsections that discuss the benchmarks used for evaluation. The authors mention testing on datasets such as **ZINC**, **MolHIV**, **CIFAR10**, and **MNIST**. I will take note of these datasets and their contexts.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and will provide additional context about the datasets.

1. **ZINC Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Dwivedi, V. P., Joshi, C. K., Laurent, T., Bengio, Y., & Bresson, X. (2020). Benchmarking graph neural networks. *arXiv preprint arXiv:2003.00982*.

2. **MolHIV Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Dwivedi, V. P., Joshi, C. K., Laurent, T., Bengio, Y., & Bresson, X. (2020). Benchmarking graph neural networks. *arXiv preprint arXiv:2003.00982*.

3. **CIFAR10 Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Krizhevsky, A. (2009). Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images. *Technical Report*.

4. **MNIST Dataset**: The citation is:
   > LeCun, Y., Cortes, C., & Burges, C. J. C. (1998). MNIST handwritten digit database. *AT&T Labs*.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will allow for a structured output that can be used for further analysis or integration into other systems.
