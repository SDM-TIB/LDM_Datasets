To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Autonomous Deep Learning: A Genetic DCNN Designer for Image Classification" by Benteng Ma and Yong Xia, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. In the abstract, the authors state that their results are based on several datasets, which indicates that I should look for specific names.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors provide a summary of the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they list the following datasets:

1. **MNIST**: A dataset for handwritten digit recognition, containing 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images, with 10 classes (digits 0-9).
2. **EMNIST-Digits**: An extension of MNIST, containing 240,000 training images and 40,000 testing images, also with 10 classes.
3. **EMNIST-Letters**: Another extension of MNIST, containing 124,800 training images and 20,800 testing images, with 26 classes (uppercase and lowercase letters).
4. **Fashion-MNIST**: A dataset for clothing classification, containing 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images, with 10 classes.
5. **CIFAR10**: A dataset containing 50,000 training images and 10,000 testing images, with 10 classes.
6. **CIFAR100**: An extension of CIFAR10, containing 50,000 training images and 10,000 testing images, with 100 classes.

In the **experiments section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used to evaluate their proposed genetic DCNN designer, which further validates the datasets listed in section 4.1.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:

- For **MNIST**, the citation is:
  > Y. LeCun, L. Bottou, Y. Bengio, and P. Haffner. *Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition*. Proceedings of the IEEE, 86(11):2278â€“2324, 1998.

- For **EMNIST-Digits** and **EMNIST-Letters**, the citation is:
  > G. Cohen, S. Afshar, J. Tapson, and A. van Schaik. *EMNIST: an extension of MNIST to handwritten letters*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1702.05373, 2017.

- For **Fashion-MNIST**, the citation is:
  > H. Xiao, K. Rasul, and R. Vollgraf. *Fashion-mnist: a novel image dataset for benchmarking machine learning algorithms*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1708.07747, 2017.

- For **CIFAR10** and **CIFAR100**, the citation is:
  > A. Krizhevsky and G. Hinton. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. 2009.

With this information, I can now compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will allow for a structured output that is ready for further processing or review.
