To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Absolute Wrong Makes Better: Boosting Weakly Supervised Object Detection via Negative Deterministic Information" by Guanchun Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on several public benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets and Evaluation Metrics)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they mention:

1. **VOC 2007**: This dataset is a well-known benchmark for object detection, and the authors use the trainval set for training and the test set for evaluation.
2. **VOC 2012**: Similar to VOC 2007, this dataset is also a standard benchmark for object detection, and the authors evaluate their method on the test and trainval sets.
3. **MS COCO**: This dataset is another popular benchmark in the field of object detection, and the authors use the train2014 set for training and the val2014 set for evaluation.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide performance metrics for their method on these datasets, confirming that they are indeed the datasets utilized in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for these datasets:

- For **VOC 2007**, the citation is:
  > Everingham, M., Van Gool, L., Williams, C. K. I., Winn, J., & Zisserman, A. (2010). The Pascal Visual Object Classes (VOC) Challenge. *International Journal of Computer Vision*, 88(2), 303-338.

- For **VOC 2012**, the citation is:
  > Everingham, M., Van Gool, L., Williams, C. K. I., Winn, J., & Zisserman, A. (2010). The Pascal Visual Object Classes (VOC) Challenge. *International Journal of Computer Vision*, 88(2), 303-338. (Note: The same citation is used for both VOC 2007 and VOC 2012 as they are part of the same challenge.)

- For **MS COCO**, the citation is:
  > Lin, T. Y., Maire, M., Belongie, S., Hays, J., Perona, P., Ramanan, D., Dollar, P., & Zitnick, C. L. (2014). Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context. In *European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV)* (pp. 740-755).

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all details are accurately represented for future reference or processing.
