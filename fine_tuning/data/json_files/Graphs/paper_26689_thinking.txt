To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-Agent Routing Value Iteration Network" by Quinlan Sykora, Mengye Ren, and Raquel Urtasun, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information accurately, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may highlight key datasets used for evaluation. The introduction often elaborates on the problem being addressed and may reference specific datasets that are central to the research.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **experiments**. In this paper, the authors mention a dataset in the **Experiments** section, specifically in **section 5 (Autonomous Mapping Benchmark)**. Here, they describe a dataset containing **22,814 directed road graphs collected from 18 cities around the world**. This is a significant dataset that I need to document.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset mentioned. The authors refer to the traffic simulation methods used in their experiments, which may also lead to additional datasets or sources that are relevant.

The key dataset identified is:
1. **Autonomous Mapping Benchmark**: This dataset consists of 22,814 directed road graphs collected from 18 cities around the world, with statistics provided in Table 3 of the paper.

Now, I will compile the full citation for this dataset. Since the dataset is part of the research conducted by the authors, I will cite the paper itself as the source of the dataset:

- For the **Autonomous Mapping Benchmark**, the citation is:
  > Quinlan Sykora, Mengye Ren, and Raquel Urtasun. *Multi-Agent Routing Value Iteration Network*. In Proceedings of the 37th International Conference on Machine Learning, Online, PMLR 119, 2020.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the dataset details and ensure that the citation is included correctly. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
