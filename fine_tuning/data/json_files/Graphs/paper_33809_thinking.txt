To extract datasets from the research paper titled "AttackGNN: Red-Teaming GNNs in Hardware Security Using Reinforcement Learning" by Vasudev Gohil et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the work, and I will look for any mention of datasets used for experiments or evaluations.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors often discuss the context of their research and may mention specific datasets used in their experiments. I will look for phrases that indicate the use of datasets, such as "we evaluated on," "we used," or "the dataset consists of."

In the **methodology section**, I will pay close attention to any subsections that describe the experimental setup or data collection process. This section is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets, including their names, sizes, and any relevant characteristics.

I will also check the **results section** to see if the authors discuss the performance of their methods on specific datasets. This may provide additional context or confirmation of the datasets used.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

For this paper, I anticipate that the following datasets may be mentioned:

1. **GNN4IP Dataset**: This dataset is likely used for evaluating the GNN-based technique for IP piracy detection. I will look for the citation associated with this dataset.

2. **TrojanSAINT Dataset**: This dataset may be used for evaluating the GNN-based technique for hardware Trojan detection. I will also find the citation for this dataset.

3. **GNN-RE Dataset**: This dataset is likely used for evaluating the GNN-based technique for reverse engineering circuits. I will locate the citation for this dataset as well.

4. **OMLA Dataset**: This dataset may be used for evaluating the GNN-based technique for hardware obfuscation. I will find the citation for this dataset.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, including their names, descriptions, and citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference.

Finally, I will ensure that each dataset entry includes the full citation, as this is essential for proper academic practice and allows others to locate the datasets used in the research.
