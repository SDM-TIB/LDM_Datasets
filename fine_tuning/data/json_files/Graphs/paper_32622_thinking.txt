To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Uncertainty-Aware Probabilistic Graph Neural Networks for Road-Level Traffic Crash Prediction" by Xiaowei Gao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on traffic crash prediction, which may hint at the datasets used.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their empirical tests. In this section, the authors mention that they used real-world traffic data from London, UK, specifically referencing the **UK STATS19 dataset**. This dataset is crucial for understanding the context of the experiments conducted.

I will then look for any additional datasets mentioned in the **data description** subsection of section 4.1. Here, the authors provide details about the datasets from three boroughs of London: **Westminster, Lambeth, and Tower Hamlets**. They describe the characteristics of the datasets, including the number of roads, edges, and the extent of zero-inflation in the data.

Now, I will compile the full citations for the datasets mentioned in the paper. The UK STATS19 dataset is maintained by the Department for Transport, and I will ensure to include the appropriate citation for it. The citation for the STATS19 dataset is as follows:

- **UK STATS19 Dataset**:
  > Department for Transport. *Road Safety Data: STATS19*. Available at: https://www.gov.uk/guidance/road-crash-and-safety-statistics-guidance.

Next, I will summarize the datasets used in the experiments:

1. **UK STATS19 Dataset**: This dataset contains detailed information about traffic crashes in the UK, including severity and related vehicle data. It is used to analyze traffic crash occurrences in the three boroughs of London.

2. **Westminster Dataset**: Contains data specific to the Westminster borough, including road and crash statistics.

3. **Lambeth Dataset**: Contains data specific to the Lambeth borough, including road and crash statistics.

4. **Tower Hamlets Dataset**: Contains data specific to the Tower Hamlets borough, including road and crash statistics.

Finally, I will ensure that I have documented the datasets clearly, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ready for any structured output or further processing.
