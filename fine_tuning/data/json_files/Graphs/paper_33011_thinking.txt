To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Generalized Multi-stage Clustering: Multi-view Self-distillation" by Jiatai Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information accurately, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that extensive experiments were conducted on real-world multi-view datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors explicitly list the datasets used. In this case, they mention using **eight datasets** for their experiments, which are summarized in **Table II**. I will carefully note down the names and details of these datasets.

The datasets mentioned in the paper are:

1. **Scene Dataset**: Contains 4,485 samples with 7 categories and dimensions of 40/254.
2. **MNIST-USPS Dataset**: Contains 5,000 samples with 10 categories and dimensions of 784.
3. **BDGP Dataset**: Contains 2,500 samples with 5 categories and dimensions of 1750/79.
4. **Fashion Dataset**: Contains 10,000 samples with 10 categories and dimensions of 784.
5. **Caltech-2V Dataset**: Contains 1,400 samples with 7 categories and dimensions of 40/254.
6. **Caltech-3V Dataset**: Contains 1,400 samples with 7 categories and dimensions of 40/254/928.
7. **Caltech-4V Dataset**: Contains 1,400 samples with 7 categories and dimensions of 40/254/928/512.
8. **Caltech-5V Dataset**: Contains 1,400 samples with 7 categories and dimensions of 40/254/928/512/1984.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets are typically found in the references, and I will ensure to include them accurately.

For example, the citation for the **Fashion-MNIST dataset** is:
> Xiao, H., Rasul, K., & Vollgraf, R. (2017). Fashion-MNIST: A novel image dataset for benchmarking machine learning algorithms. arXiv preprint arXiv:1708.07747.

The citation for the **Scene dataset** is:
> Fei-Fei, L., & Perona, P. (2005). A Bayesian hierarchical model for learning natural scene categories. In 2005 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR’05) (Vol. 2, pp. 524–531).

I will continue this process for each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring that I capture the correct citation format as per the references provided.

Finally, I will compile all the dataset entries, including their descriptions and citations, into a structured format that is ready for review or further processing.
