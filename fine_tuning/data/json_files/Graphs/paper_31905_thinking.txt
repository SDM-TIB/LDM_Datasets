To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Self-supervised Fine-tuning for Improved Content Representations" by Heng-Jui Chang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, method, and experiments sections** to locate any datasets that are explicitly referenced. The abstract mentions the use of **LibriSpeech**, which is a strong indication that this dataset is utilized in their experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors describe their setup. In **section 3.1 (Setup)**, they state that "Spin is trained with the LibriSpeech train-clean 100 hours subset." This confirms that **LibriSpeech** is indeed one of the datasets used in their research.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the **LibriSpeech** dataset. The relevant citation is:

- For **LibriSpeech**:
  > V. Panayotov, G. Chen, D. Povey, and S. Khudanpur. *LibriSpeech: An ASR corpus based on public domain audio books*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP), pages 5206â€“5210, 2015.

Additionally, the paper mentions the **SUPERB** benchmark in section 3.3, which is a performance evaluation framework rather than a dataset itself. However, it references various tasks that utilize datasets, but it does not provide specific dataset names beyond **LibriSpeech**.

Now, I will compile the identified dataset into a structured format, ensuring to include the full citation for **LibriSpeech**.

In summary, the only dataset explicitly mentioned in the paper is **LibriSpeech**, and I will document it accordingly with its citation.
