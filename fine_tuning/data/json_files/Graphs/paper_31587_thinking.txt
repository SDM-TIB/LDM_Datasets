To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A2J-Transformer: Anchor-to-Joint Transformer Network for 3D Interacting Hand Pose Estimation from a Single RGB Image" by Changlong Jiang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract highlights the use of the **InterHand 2.6M dataset**, which is a strong indicator that it is a primary dataset for the research.

Next, I will look into **section 4.1 (Experimental Setting)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention:

1. **InterHand 2.6M dataset**: This dataset is described as containing 1.36 million training images and 849,000 test images, with semi-automatically annotated 3D coordinates for 42 hand joints.

2. **RHP dataset**: This is a synthesized dataset containing two isolated hand data, with 41,000 training samples and 2,700 testing samples.

3. **NYU dataset**: This dataset consists of 72,000 training images and 8,200 testing images, annotated with 3D coordinates for 36 hand joints.

4. **HANDS 2017 dataset**: This dataset includes 957,000 training images and 295,000 testing images, combined from BigHand2.2M and First-Person Hand Action datasets, with ground-truth 3D coordinates for 21 hand joints.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **InterHand 2.6M dataset**, the citation is:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
