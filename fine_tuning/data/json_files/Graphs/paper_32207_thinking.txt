To extract datasets from the research paper titled "GraSS: Contrastive Learning with Gradient Guided Sampling Strategy for Remote Sensing Image Semantic Segmentation" by Zhaoyang Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on **three open datasets**, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section IV (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. They state that they selected three high-resolution remote sensing image semantic segmentation datasets: **Potsdam**, **LoveDA Urban**, and **LoveDA Rural**. This section provides a brief overview of each dataset, including their resolutions and crop sizes.

In the **table (Table I)** within this section, the authors provide detailed information about each dataset, including:
- **Potsdam**: Resolution of 0.05 m and crop size of 256×256.
- **LoveDA Urban**: Resolution of 0.3 m and crop size of 256×256.
- **LoveDA Rural**: Resolution of 0.3 m and crop size of 256×256.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **Potsdam** dataset:
  > Rottensteiner, F., Sohn, G., Jung, J., Gerke, M., Baillard, C., Benitez, S., & Breitkopf, U. (2012). *The ISPRS benchmark on urban object classification and 3D building reconstruction*. ISPRS Annals of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences, I-3, 293-298.

- For **LoveDA Urban** and **LoveDA Rural** datasets:
  > Wang, J., Zheng, Z., Lu, X., & Zhong, Y. (2021). *Loveda: A remote sensing land-cover dataset for domain adaptive semantic segmentation*. In Proceedings of the Thirty-fifth Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems Datasets and Benchmarks Track, 1-16.

With this information, I can now summarize the datasets extracted from the paper, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This structured approach ensures that I capture all relevant details while adhering to the importance of proper citation.
