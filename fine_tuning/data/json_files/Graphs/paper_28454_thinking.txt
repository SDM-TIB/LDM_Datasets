To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Self-supervised Contrastive Attributed Graph Clustering" by Wei Xia et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the proposed method is evaluated on **four benchmark datasets**, which indicates that I should look for specific names and details of these datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly **section 3.1.1 (Benchmark Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they mention four datasets:

1. **ACM Dataset**: This dataset is described as having 3,025 nodes, 1,870 attribute dimensions, 29,281 edges, and 3 classes. It is related to paper relationships.

2. **DBLP Dataset**: This dataset consists of 4,057 nodes, 334 attribute dimensions, 5,000,495 edges, and 4 classes, focusing on author relationships.

3. **Amazon-Photo Dataset**: This dataset includes 7,650 nodes, 745 attribute dimensions, 119,081 edges, and 8 classes, related to commodity purchase relationships.

4. **Amazon-Computers Dataset**: This dataset has 13,752 nodes, 767 attribute dimensions, 245,861 edges, and 10 classes, also concerning commodity purchase relationships.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The paper does not provide specific citations for the datasets, but it does reference the sources where these datasets can be found. I will compile the information based on the details provided in the paper.

Now, I will summarize the datasets with their respective details and citations:

- For the **ACM Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Tang, J., Zhang, J., Yao, L., Li, J., Zhang, L., & Su, Z. (2008). Arnetminer: extraction and mining of academic social networks. In *ACM SIGKDD*, pages 990–998.

- For the **DBLP Dataset**, the citation is:
  > https://dblp.uni-trier.de/

- For the **Amazon-Photo Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Shchur, O., Mumme, M., Bojchevski, A., & Günnemann, S. (2018). Pitfalls of graph neural network evaluation. In *NeurIPS Workshop on Relational Representation Learning*.

- For the **Amazon-Computers Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Shchur, O., Mumme, M., Bojchevski, A., & Günnemann, S. (2018). Pitfalls of graph neural network evaluation. In *NeurIPS Workshop on Relational Representation Learning*.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for further processing or review.
