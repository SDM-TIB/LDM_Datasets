To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SCALP - Supervised Contrastive Learning for Cardiopulmonary Disease Classification and Localization in Chest X-rays using Patient Metadata" by Ajay Jaiswal et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of a novel data augmentation method for chest X-rays, which suggests that there may be specific datasets referenced later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically **section IV (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention the **NIH Chest X-ray dataset**, which consists of 112,120 chest X-rays collected from 30,805 patients, and each image is labeled with 8 cardiopulmonary disease labels. This dataset is crucial for their classification and localization tasks.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the NIH Chest X-ray dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:
> Wang, X., Peng, Y., Lu, L., Lu, Z., Bagheri, M., & Summers, R. M. (2017). *ChestX-ray8: Hospital-scale chest x-ray database and benchmarks on weakly-supervised classification and localization of common thorax diseases*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2017, pp. 2097-2106.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the findings:

1. **NIH Chest X-ray dataset**: This dataset is used for training and evaluating the SCALP model. It contains a large number of chest X-ray images with associated disease labels, making it suitable for the tasks of classification and localization.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that the full citation is included for the dataset.
