To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Tracking Interaction States for Multi-Turn Text-to-SQL Semantic Parsing" by Run-Ze Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and related work sections** to gather initial insights about the datasets used in the research. The abstract mentions that the experimental results are based on the **CoSQL dataset**, which indicates that this dataset is crucial for the study.

Next, I will focus on the **Preliminary section**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they explicitly mention two datasets:

1. **CoSQL**: This dataset is described as a large-scale conversational and multi-turn text-to-SQL semantic parsing dataset, consisting of over 30,000 turns and 10,000 annotated SQL queries. It was collected from Wizard-of-Oz conversations querying 200 complex databases across 138 domains.

2. **SParC**: This dataset is another multi-turn text-to-SQL task, containing 3,034 interactions with 140 databases for training, 422 interactions with 20 databases for development, and 841 interactions with 40 databases for testing.

In the **References section**, I will look for the full citations for these datasets to ensure proper attribution. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **CoSQL**, the citation is:
  > Yu, T., Zhang, R., Er, H., Li, S., Xue, E., Pang, B., Lin, X. V., Tan, Y. C., Shi, T., Li, Z., et al. (2019). *CoSQL: A Conversational Text-to-SQL Challenge Towards Cross-Domain Natural Language Interfaces to Databases*. In Proceedings of the 2019 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing and the 9th International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing (EMNLP-IJCNLP), 1962â€“1979.

- For **SParC**, the citation is:
  > Yu, T., Zhang, R., Yasunaga, M., Tan, Y. C., Lin, X. V., Li, S., Heyang Er, I. L., Pang, B., Chen, T., Ji, E., Dixit, S., Proctor, D., Shim, S., Jonathan Kraft, V. Z., Xiong, C., Socher, R., and Radev, D. (2019). *SParC: Cross-Domain Semantic Parsing in Context*. In Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics. Florence, Italy: Association for Computational Linguistics.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their full citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and provided proper citations for each.
