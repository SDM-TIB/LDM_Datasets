To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Training Neural Operators to Preserve Invariant Measures of Chaotic Attractors" by Ruoxi Jiang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention key datasets used for experiments or evaluations.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, which typically contains detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the study. I will look for any specific dataset names, descriptions, and the context in which they were used. The authors may also provide insights into the characteristics of the datasets, such as the number of samples, types of data, and any preprocessing steps taken.

In this paper, the authors mention two specific chaotic systems for which they generated datasets: the **Lorenz-96 system** and the **Kuramoto-Sivashinsky system**. I will extract relevant details about these datasets, including how they were generated, the parameters used, and any specific characteristics that are highlighted in the text.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets or related works that are referenced. This is crucial for providing proper attribution and context for the datasets used in the research.

For the **Lorenz-96 dataset**, the citation is:
> Andrew J. Majda and John Harlim. *Filtering Complex Turbulent Systems*. Cambridge University Press, 2012.

For the **Kuramoto-Sivashinsky dataset**, the citation is:
> James M. Hyman and Basil Nicolaenko. *The Kuramoto-Sivashinsky Equation: A Bridge Between PDEs and Dynamical Systems*. Physica D: Nonlinear Phenomena, 18(1-3):113â€“126, 1986.

Finally, I will compile the extracted information into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is clearly documented for future reference or analysis.
