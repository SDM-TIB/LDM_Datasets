To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MATA*: Combining Learnable Node Matching with A* Algorithm for Approximate Graph Edit Distance Computation" by Junfeng Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for experiments. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of graph-structured data and mention that they will conduct experiments on real-life datasets. This indicates that datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or a similar heading, which is often where authors describe the datasets used in their experiments. In this paper, the relevant section is likely to be **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors mention three benchmark datasets: **Aids, Imdb, and Cancer**.

1. **Aids Dataset**: The authors describe it as a set of antivirus screen chemical compounds labeled with 29 types. They mention that 700 graphs with no more than ten nodes are sampled for this dataset.

2. **Imdb Dataset**: This dataset consists of 1,500 ego-networks of movie actors or actresses, and it is noted to be a non-attributed graph.

3. **Cancer Dataset**: This dataset includes 32,577 graphs of molecules discovered in carcinogenic tumors. The authors sampled 800 graphs with nodes ranging from 21 to 90, with nodes labeled with 37 types of atoms.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution.

- For the **Aids dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yunsheng Bai, Hao Ding, Song Bian, Ting Chen, Yizhou Sun, and Wei Wang. *SimGNN: A Neural Network Approach to Fast Graph Similarity Computation*. In Proceedings of the 12th ACM International Conference on Web Search and Data Mining (WSDM), pages 384–392, 2019.

- For the **Imdb dataset**, the citation is:
  > Pinar Yanardag and S. V. N. Vishwanathan. *Deep Graph Kernels*. In Proceedings of the 21th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, pages 1365–1374, 2015.

- For the **Cancer dataset**, the citation is:
  > The Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network. *Comprehensive and Integrative Genomic Characterization of Adult Soft Tissue Sarcomas*. Cell, 171(4):950-965, 2017.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their respective citations from the paper.
