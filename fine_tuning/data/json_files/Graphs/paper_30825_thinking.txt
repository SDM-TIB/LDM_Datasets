To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Self-supervised On-device Federated Learning from Unlabeled Streams" by Jiahe Shi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on various public datasets, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors describe their experimental setup. In this section, they explicitly mention using **CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN** datasets for evaluating their proposed method. This is a clear indication that these datasets are crucial for their research.

I will then look for any additional details about these datasets in the **background and related work section** or any other relevant sections. However, the primary mention of the datasets occurs in the experiments section, where they describe the datasets and their characteristics.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

1. **CIFAR-10**: The citation is:
   > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009.

2. **CIFAR-100**: The citation is the same as CIFAR-10 since it is part of the same dataset collection:
   > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009.

3. **SVHN**: The citation is:
   > Y. Netzer, T. Wang, A. Coates, A. Bissacco, B. Wu, and A. Y. Ng. *Reading Digits in Natural Images with Unsupervised Feature Learning*. 2011.

Having gathered the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes the full citation as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
