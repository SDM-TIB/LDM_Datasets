To extract datasets from the research paper titled "P4Contrast: Contrastive Learning with Pairs of Point-Pixel Pairs for RGB-D Scene Understanding" by Yunze Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets along with their full citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method on three large-scale RGB-D scene understanding benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 3.5 (Dataset for Pretraining)**, where the authors explicitly mention the dataset used for pretraining their model. They state that they use the **ScanNet** dataset, which is a large-scale indoor scene dataset containing approximately 1500 RGB-D scans. This section provides a clear description of the dataset's characteristics, including the presence of reconstructed point clouds and RGB images with known ground truth correspondences.

Additionally, I will check the **experiments section** to confirm the datasets used for fine-tuning and evaluation. The authors mention using **ScanNetV2**, **SUN RGB-D**, and **3RScan** for downstream tasks, which indicates that these datasets are also relevant to their research.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper from the **References section**:

1. **ScanNet**:
   > Angela Dai, Angel X Chang, Manolis Savva, Maciej Halber, Thomas Funkhouser, and Matthias Nießner. *ScanNet: Richly-annotated 3D reconstructions of indoor scenes*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 5828–5839, 2017.

2. **SUN RGB-D**:
   > Shuran Song, Samuel P Lichtenberg, and Jianxiong Xiao. *SUN RGB-D: A RGB-D Scene Understanding Benchmark Suite*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 567–576, 2015.

3. **3RScan**:
   > Johanna Wald, Armen Avetisyan, Nassir Navab, Federico Tombari, and Matthias Nießner. *RIO: 3D Object Instance Relocalization in Changing Indoor Environments*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision, pages 7658–7667, 2019.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

- **ScanNet**: A large-scale indoor scene dataset with RGB-D scans and known correspondences.
- **SUN RGB-D**: A benchmark suite for RGB-D scene understanding.
- **3RScan**: A dataset featuring 3D reconstructions of indoor environments.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
