To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A-JEPA: Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture Can Listen" by Zhengcong Fei et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the A-JEPA model sets new state-of-the-art performance on multiple audio and speech classification tasks, which suggests that various datasets are likely involved in the evaluation of the model.

Next, I will look into **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they explicitly mention several datasets:

1. **AudioSet**: This dataset is referenced multiple times and is described as comprising approximately 2 million 10-second audio clips, which are weakly annotated for 527 types of audio events. The authors provide citations for the dataset, indicating its significance in their experiments.

2. **Environmental Sound Classification (ESC-50)**: This dataset consists of 2,000 environmental sound recordings, each lasting 5 seconds, and is used for audio classification tasks.

3. **Speech Commands (SPC-1 and SPC-2)**: These datasets are used for keyword spotting tasks. SPC-2 includes 35 speech commands, while SPC-1 encompasses 10 classes of keywords, along with silence and unknown classes.

4. **VoxCeleb (SID)**: This dataset contains 150,000 utterances attributed to 1,251 distinct speakers, used for speaker identification tasks.

After identifying these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to gather the full citations for each dataset:

- For **AudioSet**, the citation is:
  > Jort F Gemmeke, Daniel PW Ellis, Dylan Freedman, Aren Jansen, Wade Lawrence, R Channing Moore, Manoj Plakal, and Marvin Ritter. *Audio set: An ontology and human-labeled dataset for audio events*. In 2017 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP), pages 776–780. IEEE, 2017.

- For **ESC-50**, the citation is:
  > Karol J. Piczak. *ESC: Dataset for Environmental Sound Classification*. In Proceedings of the 23rd Annual ACM Conference on Multimedia, pages 1015–1018. ACM Press, 2015.

- For **Speech Commands (SPC-1 and SPC-2)**, the citation is:
  > P. Warden. *Speech Commands: A Dataset for Limited-Vocabulary Speech Recognition*. ArXiv e-prints, April 2018.

- For **VoxCeleb (SID)**, the citation is:
  > Arsha Nagrani, Joon Son Chung, Weidi Xie, and Andrew Zisserman. *Voxceleb: Large-scale speaker verification in the wild*. Comput. Speech Lang., 60, 2020.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This systematic approach ensures that I capture all relevant datasets and their proper citations from the research paper.
