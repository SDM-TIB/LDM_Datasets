To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Semantics-Guided Contrastive Network for Zero-Shot Object Detection" by Caixia Yan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that extensive experiments were conducted on two popular benchmarks for zero-shot detection, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors discuss the datasets used. In this section, they explicitly mention two datasets:

1. **PASCAL VOC**: This dataset is described as consisting of 20 common object categories for object class recognition, with specific details about the number of training and validation images.

2. **MS COCO**: This dataset is noted for its design for object detection and semantic segmentation tasks, containing a large number of images across multiple categories.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **PASCAL VOC**, the citation is:
  > M. Everingham, L. Van Gool, C. K. Williams, J. Winn, and A. Zisserman. "The PASCAL Visual Object Classes (VOC) Challenge." *International Journal of Computer Vision*, vol. 88, no. 2, pp. 303–338, 2010.

- For **MS COCO**, the citation is:
  > T.-Y. Lin, M. Maire, S. Belongie, J. Hays, P. Perona, D. Ramanan, P. Dollár, and C. L. Zitnick. "Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context." In *ECCV*, 2014.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that I adhere to the required format for clarity and completeness. This will allow for a structured output that can be easily processed or reviewed later.
