To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Scattering GCN: Overcoming Oversmoothness in Graph Convolutional Networks" by Yimeng Min et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the evaluation of the proposed method on various datasets, which indicates that datasets are likely discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 8 (Empirical Results)**, where the authors summarize their comparisons based on four popular graph datasets. This section is crucial as it provides specific details about the datasets used in their experiments.

The datasets mentioned in this section are:

1. **Citeseer**: A citation network dataset commonly used for node classification tasks.
2. **Cora**: Another citation network dataset that is widely used in machine learning research.
3. **Pubmed**: A dataset derived from PubMed articles, also used for node classification.
4. **DBLP**: A dataset based on the DBLP computer science bibliography, which contains a rich connectivity structure.

In the **table summarizing dataset characteristics**, I will note the number of nodes, edges, and features for each dataset, as well as the mean and standard deviation of node degrees. This information is essential for understanding the context in which the datasets are used.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are typically provided in the context of the datasets' original publications or descriptions. 

For example, the citations for the datasets might look like this:

- **Cora**: 
  > Zhilin Yang, William Cohen, and Ruslan Salakhudinov. *Revisiting semi-supervised learning with graph embeddings*. In Proceedings of The 33rd International Conference on Machine Learning, volume 48 of PMLR, pages 40–48, 2016.

- **Citeseer**: 
  > Sami Abu-El-Haija, Bryan Perozzi, Amol Kapoor, Nazanin Alipourfard, Kristina Lerman, Hrayr Harutyunyan, Greg Ver Steeg, and Aram Galstyan. *MixHop: Higher-order graph convolutional architectures via sparsified neighborhood mixing*. In Proceedings of the 36th International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML), volume 97 of PMLR, pages 21–29, 2019.

- **Pubmed**: 
  > Zhilin Yang, William Cohen, and Ruslan Salakhudinov. *Revisiting semi-supervised learning with graph embeddings*. In Proceedings of The 33rd International Conference on Machine Learning, volume 48 of PMLR, pages 40–48, 2016.

- **DBLP**: 
  > Shirui Pan, Jia Wu, Xingquan Zhu, Chengqi Zhang, and Yang Wang. *Tri-party deep network representation*. In Proceedings of the 25th International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI), pages 1895–1901, 2016.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described with its full citation. This structured approach will help in creating a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
