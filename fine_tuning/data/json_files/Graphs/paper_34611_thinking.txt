To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Extracting chemical food safety hazards from the scientific literature automatically using large language models" by Neris Ã–zena et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to locate any datasets that are explicitly referenced. The abstract mentions the use of an open-source LLM to extract chemical hazards from scientific abstracts, which suggests that there may be datasets related to food safety hazards.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsection titled **"Abstracts collection and preprocessing."** Here, the authors describe their data collection process using the Europe PMC repository to gather scientific abstracts related to chemical contamination in food. This indicates that the dataset consists of abstracts from this repository.

I will also look for any specific datasets mentioned in the **results section**. The authors provide statistics on the number of unique abstracts retrieved, which is **101,727**, and they specify the number of relevant abstracts filtered for validation and test foods. This includes **411 abstracts for leafy greens, 1235 for shellfish, 1403 for dairy, 1318 for maize, and 353 for salmon**. These numbers suggest that the authors have created subsets of data for specific food items.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper references the Europe PMC repository, which is a significant source of scientific literature. However, it does not provide a specific citation for the dataset of abstracts used, as it is a publicly accessible repository.

To summarize the datasets identified:
1. **Dataset of Scientific Abstracts**: This dataset includes abstracts related to chemical contamination in food, collected from the Europe PMC repository. The total number of unique abstracts is **101,727**, with specific subsets for validation and test foods.

2. **Validation and Test Food Abstracts**: The paper specifies the number of relevant abstracts for validation foods (leafy greens and shellfish) and test foods (dairy, maize, and salmon), which are subsets of the larger dataset.

Since the Europe PMC repository is a well-known and widely used database, I will provide its citation as follows:
> Europe PMC. (n.d.). Europe PMC: A free database of life sciences and biomedical literature. Retrieved from https://europepmc.org/

Now, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing.
