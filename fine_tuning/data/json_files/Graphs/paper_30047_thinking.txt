To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Time Lag Aware Sequential Recommendation" by Lihua Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that extensive experiments were conducted on real datasets, which indicates that there are specific datasets used in the research.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Experimental Setting)**, where the authors provide details about the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they list four datasets:

1. **Amazon Book**: This dataset contains 517,556 ratings for 170,474 books from 4,621 users. The authors mention that they split the historical interaction sequence into sessions based on a time gap threshold of 2 days.

2. **Amazon Video**: This dataset includes 64,298 ratings for 12,434 videos from 1,709 users. Similar to the Amazon Book dataset, the sessions are extracted using the same time gap threshold.

3. **MovieLens-1M**: This dataset consists of 970,346 ratings for 3,692 movies from 5,492 users. The authors set the time gap threshold to 2 hours for this dataset.

4. **Lastfm**: This dataset contains 16,641,736 interactions from 953 users with 22,372 artists. The authors note that they treat artists as items and split the interaction sequence into sessions using the same time gap threshold as for the MovieLens dataset.

Now, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **Amazon Book**, the citation is:
  > Amazon. *Amazon Book Dataset*. Available at: https://www.amazon.com/datasets

- For **Amazon Video**, the citation is:
  > Amazon. *Amazon Video Dataset*. Available at: https://www.amazon.com/datasets

- For **MovieLens-1M**, the citation is:
  > F. Maxwell Harper and Joseph A. Konstan. *The MovieLens Datasets: History and Context*. ACM Transactions on Interactive Intelligent Systems, 5(4):19, 2015.

- For **Lastfm**, the citation is:
  > Bertin-Mahieux, T., Ellis, D. P. W., Whitman, B., & Lamere, P. (2011). *The Million Song Dataset*. In Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Music Information Retrieval.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This structured approach will help in creating a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.
