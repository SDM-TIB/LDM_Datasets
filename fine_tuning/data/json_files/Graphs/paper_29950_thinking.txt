To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Collaborating Domain-shared and Target-specific Feature Clustering for Cross-domain 3D Action Recognition" by Qinying Liu and Zilei Wang, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and it may mention specific datasets used for evaluation. 

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of cross-domain 3D action recognition and reference datasets that are relevant to their study. I will look for explicit mentions of dataset names and their characteristics.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention several datasets:

1. **NTU-60**: This dataset is a large-scale benchmark for 3D human activity understanding, containing 60 action classes. The skeletons are captured using Microsoft Kinect V2.

2. **NTU-120**: An extended version of NTU-60, this dataset includes 120 action classes, with some classes overlapping with NTU-60. It is also captured using Kinect V2.

3. **PKU-MMD**: This dataset is designed for temporal action detection and contains 51 classes that differ from those in NTU-60+. It is also collected using Kinect V2.

4. **Skeletics**: A dataset sourced from real-world videos, where 3D poses are estimated using the VIBE method. It contains a variety of action classes and is noted for its challenges due to the quality of the skeleton data.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **NTU-60** and **NTU-120**:

- For **PKU-MMD**:

Now that I have gathered the dataset names and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
