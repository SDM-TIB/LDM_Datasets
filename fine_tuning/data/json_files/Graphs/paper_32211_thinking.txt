To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Protein-DNA binding sites prediction based on pre-trained protein language model and contrastive learning" by Yufan Liu and Boxue Tian, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors trained their model on a "protein-DNA binding sites dataset" and evaluated it on "two benchmark datasets." This suggests that there are specific datasets that need to be identified.

Next, I will look for explicit mentions of datasets in the **methods section**, particularly under the "Datasets description" subsection. Here, the authors provide detailed information about the datasets used:

1. **Dataset1**: This dataset was introduced by the DBPred model and consists of 646 proteins (TR646) with 15,636 DNA-binding sites and 298,503 non-binding sites. The testing set (TE46) includes 46 proteins with 956 DNA-binding sites and 9,911 non-binding sites.

2. **Dataset2**: Originally proposed by the GraphBind study, this dataset consists of protein-DNA complex structural data from the BioLiP database. It includes 573 proteins (TR573) with 14,479 DNA-binding residues and 145,404 non-binding residues, and the testing set (TE129) has 129 proteins with 2,240 DNA-binding residues and 35,275 non-binding residues.

In the **results section**, the authors compare their model's performance on these datasets, confirming their significance in the study.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **Dataset1**, the citation is:
  > Patiyal, S., Dhall, A., & Raghava, G. P. (2022). A deep learning-based method for the prediction of DNA interacting residues in a protein. *Briefings in Bioinformatics*, 23.

- For **Dataset2**, the citation is:
  > Xia, Y., Xia, C.-Q., Pan, X., & Shen, H.-B. (2021). GraphBind: protein structural context embedded rules learned by hierarchical graph neural networks for recognizing nucleic-acid-binding residues. *Nucleic Acids Research*, 49, e51.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant details regarding the datasets used in the study.
