To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Predicting the Impact of Batch Refactoring Code Smells on Application Resource Consumption" by Asif Imran et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's aims and methods, which may hint at the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the impact of code smells on resource consumption and mention that they analyze 31 open-source applications. This indicates that there are datasets related to these applications.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, where the authors describe their experimental setup. They mention using 24 open-source Java applications from the Qualitas Corpus and 7 Python applications. This is a clear indication of the datasets involved.

The paper also references specific datasets in the context of workloads for the applications. For example, they mention using the **Eclipse bug dataset** for testing software and provide a link to a GitHub page where the selected applications are listed. This is crucial for identifying the datasets.

I will also check the **results section** for any additional datasets or specific details about the applications used in the experiments. The authors provide a detailed analysis of the impact of refactoring on resource consumption, which may include references to the datasets.

Finally, I will consult the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. This is important for proper attribution and to ensure that the datasets can be accessed or referenced by others.

Based on this analysis, I will compile the datasets into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is accompanied by its full citation. The key datasets identified are:

1. **Qualitas Corpus**: A dataset of open-source Java applications used for empirical studies.
   - Citation: Ewan Tempero et al. (2010). "Qualitas Corpus: A Curated Collection of Java Code for Empirical Studies." In 2010 Asia Pacific Software Engineering Conference (APSEC2010). https://doi.org/10.1109/APSEC.2010.46

2. **Eclipse Bug Dataset**: Used as a workload for testing software applications.
   - Citation: Thomas Zimmermann et al. (2007). "Predicting defects for eclipse." In Third International Workshop on Predictor Models in Software Engineering (PROMISE’07: ICSE Workshops 2007). IEEE, 9–9.

3. **GitHub Repository**: Contains the list of selected Java and Python applications used in the study.
   - Citation: Asif Imran et al. (2023). "Predicting the Impact of Batch Refactoring Code Smells on Application Resource Consumption." GitHub Repository. https://github.com/asif33/batchrefactoring

After gathering this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for further processing or review.
