To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Graph Structure With A Finite-State Automaton Layer" by Daniel D. Johnson et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for evaluation or experimentation.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors often discuss the context of their work and may reference specific datasets that are relevant to their research. I will look for any phrases that indicate the use of datasets, such as "we evaluated on," "we used," or "the dataset consists of."

Then, I will examine the **experiments section**, particularly any subsections that are dedicated to datasets or experimental setup. This section typically contains detailed descriptions of the datasets used, including their characteristics, sizes, and any relevant statistics.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, if the authors mention a dataset like "ETH 150k Python dataset," I will look for the citation in the references, which might look something like this:
> Hellendoorn, V., Sutton, C., Singh, R., & Maniatis, P. (2020). Global relational models of source code. In International Conference on Learning Representations.

I will repeat this process for each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring that I capture the full citation for each one.

Finally, I will compile the extracted datasets along with their full citations into a structured format that can be easily reviewed or processed further.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets referenced in the paper, maintaining a focus on clarity and completeness in the citations.
