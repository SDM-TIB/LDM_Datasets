To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Adults as Augmentations for Children in Facial Emotion Recognition with Contrastive Learning" by Marco Virgolin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the challenge of data scarcity in pediatric medicine and the use of adult data to augment children's data for facial emotion recognition. This indicates that there are datasets involved, and I should look for their names.

Next, I will examine the **methods section**, particularly **section 3.3 (Experimental setup)**, where the authors describe the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they explicitly mention two datasets:

1. **Child Affective Facial Expression (CAFE) dataset**: This dataset contains 1,192 images of children aged 2 to 8 years, depicting various emotions such as anger, disgust, fear, happiness, neutral, sadness, and surprise.

2. **Facial Expression Recognition (FER) dataset**: This dataset consists of 28,000 images, primarily of adults, but it also includes some images of children. The emotions represented in this dataset are the same as those in CAFE.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **CAFE dataset**, the citation is:
  > LoBue, V., & Thrasher, C. (2015). The Child Affective Facial Expression (CAFE) set: Validity and reliability from untrained adults. *Frontiers in Psychology*, 5, 1532.

- For the **FER dataset**, the citation is:
  > Goodfellow, I. J., Erhan, D., Carrier, P. L., Courville, A., Mirza, M., Hamner, B., Cukierski, W., Tang, Y., Thaler, D., Lee, D.-H., et al. (2013). Challenges in representation learning: A report on three machine learning contests. In *International Conference on Neural Information Processing* (pp. 117â€“124). Springer.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use.

This systematic approach ensures that I accurately capture all relevant datasets and their citations from the paper, which is crucial for proper referencing and further research.
