To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Language Representations Can Be What Recommenders Need: Findings and Potentials" by Leheng Sheng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of language models in the recommendation domain, which suggests that datasets may be involved, but I need to find specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. In this paper, the authors mention using several datasets, including:

1. **Books**: This dataset is part of the Amazon platform and contains user-item interactions related to books.
2. **Movies & TV**: Another dataset from Amazon, focusing on movies and television shows.
3. **Video Games**: This dataset includes interactions related to video games, also from Amazon.
4. **Industrial & Scientific**: This dataset is part of the Amazon platform, focusing on industrial and scientific products.
5. **MovieLens-1M**: A well-known dataset for movie recommendations, containing 1 million ratings.
6. **Book Crossing**: A dataset that includes user ratings for books.

I will then check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper documentation. For example:

- For the **MovieLens-1M dataset**, the citation is:
  > Harper, F. M., & Konstan, J. A. (2016). The MovieLens Datasets: History and Context. *ACM Transactions on Interactive Intelligent Systems*, 5(4), 19:1â€“19:19.

- For the **Book Crossing dataset**, the citation is:
  > Ziegler, C. N., & Lausen, G. (2005). Analyzing the Effects of User Preferences on the Quality of Recommendations. In *Proceedings of the 2005 ACM Conference on Recommender Systems*.

After gathering the dataset names and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset's name, description, and citation.

Finally, I will ensure that all extracted information is accurate and properly formatted, ready for any further processing or review.
