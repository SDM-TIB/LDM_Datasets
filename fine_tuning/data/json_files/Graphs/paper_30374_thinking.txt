To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SMiLE: Schema-augmented Multi-level Contrastive Learning for Knowledge Graph Link Prediction" by Miao Peng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on **four knowledge graph datasets**, which indicates that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors provide details about the datasets used. In **section 4.1 (Experimental Setup)**, they explicitly list the datasets:

1. **FB15k**: A well-known dataset for knowledge graph completion tasks, originally introduced by Bordes et al. in 2013.
2. **FB15k-237**: A pruned version of FB15k, which was introduced by Toutanova and Chen in 2015.
3. **JF17k**: Another dataset referenced in the paper, introduced by Wen et al. in 2016.
4. **HumanWiki**: A dataset extracted from Wikidata, as described by Rosso et al. in 2021.

The paper provides statistics for each dataset, which further confirms their relevance and use in the experiments.

Now, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **FB15k**, the citation is:
  > Antoine Bordes, Nicolas Usunier, Alberto García-Durán, Jason Weston, and Oksana Yakhnenko. *Translating embeddings for modeling multi-relational data*. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 26: 27th Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems 2013. Proceedings of a meeting held December 5-8, 2013, Lake Tahoe, Nevada, United States, pages 2787–2795.

- For **FB15k-237**, the citation is:
  > Kristina Toutanova and Danqi Chen. *Observed versus latent features for knowledge base and text inference*. In Proceedings of the 3rd Workshop on Continuous Vector Space Models and their Compositionality, 2015.

- For **JF17k**, the citation is:
  > Jianfeng Wen, Jianxin Li, Yongyi Mao, Shini Chen, and Richong Zhang. *On the representation and embedding of knowledge bases beyond binary relations*. In Proceedings of the Twenty-Fifth International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence, IJCAI 2016, New York, NY, USA, 9-15 July 2016, pages 1300–1307.

- For **HumanWiki**, the citation is:
  > Paolo Rosso, Dingqi Yang, Natalia Ostapuk, and Philippe Cudré-Mauroux. *RETA: A schema-aware, end-to-end solution for instance completion in knowledge graphs*. In WWW ’21: The Web Conference 2021, Virtual Event / Ljubljana, Slovenia, April 19-23, 2021, pages 845–856.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its full citation for future reference or processing.
