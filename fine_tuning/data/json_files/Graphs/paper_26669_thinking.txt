To extract datasets from the research paper titled "HACT-Net: A Hierarchical Cell-to-Tissue Graph Neural Network for Histopathological Image Classification" by Pushpak Pati et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors assess their methodology on a large set of annotated tissue regions of interest from H&E stained breast carcinoma whole slides, suggesting that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will focus on the **Methods section**, particularly where the authors describe their approach and any datasets used. In this section, they introduce a new dataset called **BReAst Carcinoma Subtyping (BRACS)**, which consists of 2080 regions of interest (RoIs) acquired from 106 H&E stained breast carcinoma whole-slide images. This section provides details about the dataset, including how it was annotated and the types of cancer classes included.

In the **Experimental Results section**, the authors further elaborate on the BRACS dataset, discussing its size and the challenges it presents, such as variability in RoI dimensions and the presence of artifacts. This reinforces the importance of the BRACS dataset in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the BRACS dataset. However, it appears that the dataset is newly introduced and is currently pending approval for release to the research community, which means there may not be a formal citation available yet. The authors do reference other datasets in their work, such as the **BACH dataset**, which is mentioned as a comparison point.

For the BACH dataset, I will locate its citation in the references:
- **BACH dataset** citation:
  > G. Aresta, T. Araújo, S. Kwok, S. S. Chennamsetty, M. Safwan, V. Alex, B. Marami, M. Prastawa, M. Chan, M. Donovan et al. "Bach: Grand challenge on breast cancer histology images." *Medical image analysis*, vol. 56, pp. 122–139, 2019.

Since the BRACS dataset does not have a formal citation yet, I will note that it is a new dataset introduced in this paper.

In summary, I will create entries for the datasets identified:
1. **BReAst Carcinoma Subtyping (BRACS)**: A new dataset consisting of 2080 RoIs from 106 H&E stained breast carcinoma whole-slide images, currently pending approval for release.
2. **BACH dataset**: A well-established dataset used for comparison in the study.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing.
