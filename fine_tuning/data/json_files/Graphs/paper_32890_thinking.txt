To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Time CNN and Graph Convolution Network for Epileptic Spike Detection in MEG Data" by Pauline Mouches et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of a dataset for evaluating the proposed method, which indicates that there are datasets involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly **section III (Experiments and Results)**, where the authors describe the dataset used for their experiments. Here, they mention that the dataset consists of MEG recordings from **95 epileptic patients**, which is a crucial detail.

In **subsection A (Data and preprocessing)**, the authors provide more specifics about the dataset, including the number of patients, the duration of recordings, and the preprocessing steps taken. They mention that the recordings were analyzed and annotated by an expert neurologist, which adds credibility to the dataset.

The authors also specify that the dataset includes **4584 spike-positive frames** and **360785 spike-negative frames**, which gives insight into the dataset's composition and its relevance for the study.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. However, since the dataset is based on original MEG recordings from patients, it may not have a formal citation like a published dataset. Instead, I will note that the dataset is derived from clinical recordings and annotated by experts.

Since there are no specific dataset citations provided in the references, I will summarize the dataset information as follows:

1. **Dataset of MEG recordings**: Composed of recordings from 95 epileptic patients, with annotations for interictal spikes. The dataset includes both spike-positive and spike-negative frames.

Now, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format, ensuring that I include all relevant details and acknowledge the lack of a formal citation for the dataset derived from clinical recordings.

After completing this process, I will have a clear and concise summary of the dataset used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
