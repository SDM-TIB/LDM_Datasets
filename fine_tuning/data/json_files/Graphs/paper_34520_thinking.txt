To extract datasets from the research paper titled "USD: Unsupervised Soft Contrastive Learning for Fault Detection in Multivariate Time Series" by Hong Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the proposed method achieves improvements across multiple datasets, indicating that datasets are indeed used.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically **section V (Experiments)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they explicitly list five datasets:

1. **SWaT (Secure Water Treatment)**: This dataset originates from a scaled-down version of an industrial water treatment plant and includes 51 sensor data points collected at a frequency of one second. It provides ground truths for 41 attacks over a period of 4 days.

2. **WADI (Water Distribution)**: Collected from a water distribution testbed, this dataset consists of 121 sensor and actuator data points, also collected at a frequency of one second, with ground truths for 15 attacks over 2 days.

3. **PSM (Pooled Server Metrics)**: This dataset aggregates performance metrics from multiple server nodes managed by eBay, used to identify outliers indicating potential issues in server performance or security breaches.

4. **MSL (Mars Science Laboratory)**: Originating from the Curiosity rover, this dataset includes telemetry data used to detect anomalies in the rover’s operational parameters during its mission on Mars.

5. **SMD (Server Machine Dataset)**: Collected from a large internet company’s server farms, this dataset comprises metrics from different server machines, providing a basis for detecting unusual behaviors in server operations.

In the **References section**, I will look for full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or analysis.
