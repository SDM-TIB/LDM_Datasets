To extract datasets from the research paper titled "NJUST-KMG at TRAC-2024 Tasks 1 and 2: Offline Harm Potential Identification" by Jingyuan Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the investigation utilized a "rich dataset comprised of social media comments in several Indian languages, annotated with precision by expert judges." This indicates that there is a dataset involved, but I need to find more specific details about it.

Next, I will look into the **methodology** and **experiment** sections, particularly focusing on any sections that explicitly mention datasets. In the **experiment section**, the authors describe the tasks and the nature of the input data, stating that the models received "social media text data, extensively annotated to assess the harm potential, drawn from various Indian languages." However, they do not provide a specific name for the dataset in this section.

I will also check the **background** section, where they discuss the two sub-tasks of the TRAC-2024 challenge. They mention that the input data is drawn from various Indian languages, but again, no specific dataset name is provided.

Since the paper does not explicitly name a dataset, I will look at the **References section** to see if any cited works refer to datasets that might be relevant. I notice that the authors reference several papers that discuss models and techniques but do not provide a specific dataset citation.

Given that the dataset is described as being comprised of social media comments in several Indian languages, I will summarize the dataset as follows:

1. **Social Media Comments Dataset**: This dataset consists of social media comments in multiple Indian languages, annotated by expert judges to assess the potential for offline harm. The dataset is used for training and evaluating models in the TRAC-2024 competition.

Since the paper does not provide a specific citation for this dataset, I will note that it is a custom dataset created for the competition, and I will not be able to provide a full citation as there is no formal publication associated with it.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I clearly indicate the dataset's nature and its relevance to the research without a formal citation.

In conclusion, I will summarize the findings and prepare to present the dataset information in a clear and concise manner, ready for any further processing or review.
