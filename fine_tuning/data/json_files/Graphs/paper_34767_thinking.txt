To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "FT-AED: Benchmark Dataset for Early Freeway Traffic Anomalous Event Detection" by Austin Coursey et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant details, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the introduction of a "large-scale lane-level freeway traffic dataset for anomaly detection," which indicates that a dataset is indeed present. I will note this down as a primary dataset.

Next, I will look into **section 3 (FT-AED Dataset)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the dataset. Here, they describe the **Freeway Traffic Anomalous Event Detection (FT-AED)** dataset, which consists of traffic measurements from radar detection systems along Interstate 24. The dataset includes over 3.7 million sensor measurements collected over a month, specifically designed for anomaly detection.

In this section, the authors also mention that they sourced true incident labels from the Nashville Traffic Management Center, which adds another layer of detail to the dataset. This information is crucial for understanding the dataset's context and its intended use.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the FT-AED dataset. The authors do not provide a separate citation for the dataset itself, but they do mention that the dataset is publicly released at a specific URL. Therefore, I will include this URL as part of the dataset description.

The citation for the dataset will be:
> Coursey, A., Ji, J., Quinones-Grueiro, M., Barbour, W., Zhang, Y., Derr, T., Biswas, G., & Work, D. B. (2023). *FT-AED: Benchmark Dataset for Early Freeway Traffic Anomalous Event Detection*. Available at: https://vu.edu/ft-aed/

Now, I will summarize the dataset details:
1. **Dataset Name**: Freeway Traffic Anomalous Event Detection (FT-AED)
   - **Description**: A large-scale lane-level freeway traffic dataset designed for anomaly detection, consisting of over 3.7 million sensor measurements collected from radar detection systems along an 18-mile stretch of Interstate 24 in Tennessee.
   - **Data Collection Period**: October 2023
   - **Data Features**: Includes traffic speed, occupancy, and volume data captured every 30 seconds.
   - **Incident Labels**: True incident labels sourced from the Nashville Traffic Management Center, along with additional manually labeled anomalies.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that can be used for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured all necessary details about the dataset, including its full citation.
