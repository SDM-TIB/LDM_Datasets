To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Denoising-Aware Contrastive Learning for Noisy Time Series" by Shuang Zhou et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted extensive experiments on various datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used. In this section, they list five datasets:

1. **SleepEDF**: This dataset contains EEG recordings from 82 subjects, with a total of 153 whole-night records. The authors mention that the data is processed to obtain single-channel EEG signals.

2. **FaultDiagnosis**: This dataset is compiled from sensor measurements of a bearing machine under different working conditions, with records categorized into three classes: two fault classes and one normal class.

3. **CPSC18**: This dataset consists of ECG records collected from 9,458 patients, with each record standardized to a duration of 10 seconds. It includes nine diagnostic categories.

4. **PTB-XL**: A publicly accessible ECG dataset from 18,885 patients, standardized to a duration of 10 seconds and containing multiple arrhythmia categories.

5. **Georgia**: This ECG dataset represents a distinct demographic and includes various ECG types, standardized to a 10-second duration.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:

Now that I have gathered the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
