To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Event-Based Contrastive Learning for Medical Time Series" by Nassim Oufattole et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and dataset sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the evaluation of a method on a heart failure cohort, which suggests that a dataset is involved. I will look for specific mentions of datasets in these sections.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of predicting patient outcomes using longitudinal medical data, which indicates that they likely used a dataset for their experiments. I will look for any explicit references to datasets.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Dataset and Experimental Setting)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset used for their experiments. Here, they describe a multi-center cohort of 107,268 patients with a prior diagnosis of heart failure, which is crucial for my extraction.

The dataset is characterized as follows:
- It includes 383,254 inpatient admissions.
- The data spans a maximum of 40 years and contains up to 3,275 features, including labs, diagnoses, procedures, medications, and physical measurements.
- The cohort is restricted to clinical events with at least 16 data points for both pre-admission and post-admission data.

I will also check the **experiments section** to confirm that this dataset was indeed used for the evaluation of their proposed method.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. Since the dataset is a custom cohort created by the authors, it may not have a formal citation like publicly available datasets. However, I will note that the dataset is derived from the electronic data warehouse of a large hospital network, which is important context.

The citation for the paper itself is:
> Oufattole, N., Jeong, H., McDermott, M., Balagopalan, A., Jangeesingh, B., Ghassemi, M., & Stultz, C. (2024). Event-Based Contrastive Learning for Medical Time Series. 

Since the dataset is not a standard published dataset, I will document it as follows:
- **Dataset Name**: Heart Failure Cohort
- **Description**: A multi-center cohort of 107,268 patients with a prior diagnosis of heart failure, including 383,254 inpatient admissions and a maximum of 3,275 features over a span of 40 years.
- **Citation**: Oufattole, N., Jeong, H., McDermott, M., Balagopalan, A., Jangeesingh, B., Ghassemi, M., & Stultz, C. (2024). Event-Based Contrastive Learning for Medical Time Series.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use, ensuring that I have accurately captured the dataset details and citation.
