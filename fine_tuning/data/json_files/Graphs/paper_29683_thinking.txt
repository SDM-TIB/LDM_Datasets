To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Face Recognition Accuracy Across Demographics: Shining a Light Into the Problem" by Haiyu Wu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions exploring face recognition accuracy across demographic groups, which suggests that datasets related to these demographics may be discussed. The introduction further emphasizes the variation in accuracy across demographics, indicating that specific datasets may be referenced.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors mention using the **MORPH dataset** for their analysis. I will note the details provided about this dataset, including its size and the demographic breakdown of the images.

In the **related work** section, the authors reference other datasets such as **PIE** and **Multi-PIE**, which are used in the context of illumination and face recognition. I will ensure to capture these datasets as well, along with any relevant details provided.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets themselves.

The citations I will extract include:

1. **MORPH Dataset**:
   > Karl Ricanek and Tamirat Tesafaye. *MORPH: A longitudinal image database of normal adult age-progression*. In 7th International Conference on Automatic Face and Gesture Recognition (FGR06), pages 341–345, IEEE, 2006.

2. **PIE Dataset**:
   > Ralph Gross, Iain Matthews, Jeffrey Cohn, Takeo Kanade, and Simon Baker. *Multi-PIE*. Image and Vision Computing, 28(5):807–813, 2010.

3. **Multi-PIE Dataset**:
   > Ralph Gross, Iain Matthews, Jeffrey Cohn, Takeo Kanade, and Simon Baker. *Multi-PIE*. Image and Vision Computing, 28(5):807–813, 2010.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, including their descriptions and citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and cite the datasets used in the research paper, providing a comprehensive overview of the data sources that underpin the study's findings.
