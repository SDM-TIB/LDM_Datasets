To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Demanding and Designing Aligned Cognitive Architectures" by Koen Holtman, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections that discuss methodologies or experiments**. The abstract provides a high-level overview, but I will need to look for specific mentions of datasets in the body of the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to see if the author references any datasets or studies that inform their discussion on AI alignment. If there are mentions of empirical studies or benchmarks, I will note them down.

I will then examine the **methodology or experiments sections** (if available) for explicit mentions of datasets used in the research. These sections typically provide detailed descriptions of the datasets, including their purpose, size, and any relevant characteristics.

If the paper includes a **dedicated section on datasets**, I will pay close attention to it, as it will likely contain the most comprehensive information about each dataset used in the research.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily.

For instance, if the paper mentions a dataset like the "Cognitive Architectures Dataset," I will look for its citation in the references. If it is not explicitly cited, I will search for the original source of the dataset online or in related literature to ensure I have the correct citation.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset descriptions, including their names, purposes, and full citations, ensuring that each entry is clear and complete.

Finally, I will organize this information in a structured manner, ready for any further processing or presentation.
