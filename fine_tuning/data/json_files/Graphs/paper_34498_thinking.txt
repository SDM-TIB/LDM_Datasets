To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Cut Generating Functions for Integer Programming" by Hongyu Cheng and Amitabh Basu, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the work, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets or experiments**. In many research papers, authors will describe the datasets used for their experiments in a specific section, often labeled as "Datasets" or "Experimental Setup." This section typically includes detailed descriptions of the datasets, such as their size, structure, and any relevant characteristics.

In this paper, I will pay particular attention to any references to datasets used in the experiments. For example, if the authors mention using datasets from previous studies or publicly available datasets, I will note these down.

Once I identify the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial, as proper citation is necessary for academic integrity and allows others to locate the datasets.

For instance, if the authors mention using a dataset like the "Knapsack problem instances" or "Packing problem instances," I will look for the original sources or publications that describe these datasets. If they are well-known datasets, I will ensure to include their standard citations.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes:
1. The name of the dataset.
2. A brief description of the dataset.
3. The full citation for the dataset.

Finally, I will format this information clearly, ready for any required output or further processing. This structured approach ensures that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.
