To extract datasets from the research paper titled "RANKGEN: Improving Text Generation with Large Ranking Models" by Kalpesh Krishna et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

Step 1: I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the datasets referenced. The abstract mentions that RANKGEN is evaluated across various language models and domains, which suggests that there may be specific datasets used for these evaluations.

Step 2: Next, I will look into the **experiments** section, particularly focusing on any subsections that discuss datasets. This section typically contains detailed information about the datasets used for training and evaluation. I will pay attention to any tables or figures that might summarize the datasets.

Step 3: In the **experiments** section, I will look for mentions of specific datasets. For example, the paper discusses the use of datasets like **PG19** and **Wikipedia** for training and evaluation purposes. I will note down the context in which these datasets are mentioned, including their purpose and any relevant details.

Step 4: I will also check the **appendices** for any additional datasets that may not have been mentioned in the main body of the paper. Sometimes, supplementary materials provide further insights into the datasets used.

Step 5: After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets.

Step 6: For each dataset identified, I will compile the following information:
- **Name of the dataset**: The official name as mentioned in the paper.
- **Description**: A brief description of the dataset, including its purpose and any relevant details.
- **Full citation**: The complete reference for the dataset as found in the References section of the paper.

Step 7: Finally, I will ensure that all the information is accurately documented and formatted correctly, ready for presentation or further analysis.

By following these steps, I will be able to extract and document the datasets used in the research paper effectively, ensuring that all necessary citations are included for proper academic integrity.
