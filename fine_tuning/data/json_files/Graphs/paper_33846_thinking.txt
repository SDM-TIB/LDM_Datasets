To extract datasets from the research paper titled "One-Shot Graph Representation Learning Using Hyperdimensional Computing" by Abhishek Dalvi and Vasant Honavar, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that the proposed method is evaluated on "widely used benchmark datasets," which indicates that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4), where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention using three commonly used node labeling benchmarks: **CORA**, **CiteSeer**, and **PubMed**, along with two datasets from the Microsoft Academic Graph: **Coauthor CS** and **Coauthor Physics**. This is a clear indication that these datasets are crucial for the experiments.

I will then look for a **summary table** (Table 1) that provides details about these datasets, including the number of nodes, edges, features, classes, label rate, and edge density. This table confirms the datasets and provides additional context about their characteristics.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **CORA**, the citation is:
  > Andrew Kachites McCallum, Kamal Nigam, Jason Rennie, and Kristie Seymore. *Automating the construction of internet portals with machine learning*. Information Retrieval, 3:127–163, 2000.

- For **CiteSeer**, the citation is:
  > C. Lee Giles, Kurt D. Bollacker, and Steve Lawrence. *Citeseer: An automatic citation indexing system*. In Proceedings of the Third ACM Conference on Digital Libraries, DL ’98, page 89–98, New York, NY, USA, 1998.

- For **PubMed**, the citation is:
  > Galileo Namata, Ben London, Lise Getoor, and Bert Huang. *Query-driven active surveying for collective classification*. 2012.

- For **Coauthor CS**, the citation is:
  > Oleksandr Shchur, Aleksandar Bojchevski, and Maximilian Mumme. *Pitfalls of graph neural network evaluation*. In Relational Representation Learning Workshop, NeurIPS, 2018.

- For **Coauthor Physics**, the citation is the same as for Coauthor CS, as both datasets are from the same source.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
