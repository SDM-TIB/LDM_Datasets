To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Temporal Contrastive Learning for Spiking Neural Networks" by Haonan Qiu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned or referenced. The abstract indicates that the authors achieved state-of-the-art performance on a variety of datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be discussed later in the paper.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (Section 5) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention using several datasets, including **CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, DVS-CIFAR10, CUB-200-2011, Stanford-Cars, FGVC-Aircraft, Oxford Flowers, and Stanford Dogs**. This is a clear indication that these datasets are integral to their research.

I will then check the **dataset preprocessing and implementation details** subsection (5.1) to gather more information about how these datasets were utilized in their experiments. The authors mention that they directly fed the original images into the SNN for static and fine-grained datasets, and they also describe the data augmentation techniques applied.

Now, I will compile the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper by consulting the **References section**. Here are the citations for the datasets:

After gathering all this information, I will summarize the datasets and their citations in a structured format for easy reference. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations.
