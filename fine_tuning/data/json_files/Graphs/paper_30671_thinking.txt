To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Federated Learning for Healthcare Domain - Pipeline, Applications and Challenges" by Madhura Joshi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a high-level overview, and the introduction often outlines the key datasets used in the research context.

Next, I will look for specific sections that typically contain dataset information, such as **methodology, experiments, or results**. In this paper, I will pay close attention to any subsections that discuss the applications of federated learning in healthcare, as they may reference specific datasets used in various studies.

As I read through the paper, I will take note of any datasets explicitly mentioned, including their names, descriptions, and the context in which they are used. For example, if the authors refer to datasets related to electronic health records (EHRs), I will note the specific datasets and their characteristics.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets themselves.

For instance, if the paper mentions a dataset like the "MIMIC-III dataset," I will look for its citation in the references, which might look something like this:
> Johnson, A. E. W., Pollard, T. J., Shen, L., et al. (2016). MIMIC-III, a freely accessible critical care database. *Scientific Data*, 3, 160035. https://doi.org/10.1038/sdata.2016.35

Once I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, including their names, descriptions, and citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference.

Finally, I will ensure that each dataset entry includes the full citation, as this is essential for academic integrity and allows others to access the datasets used in the research.
