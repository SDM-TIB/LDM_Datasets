To extract datasets from the research paper titled "T-GCN: A Temporal Graph Convolutional Network for Traffic Prediction" by Ling Zhao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method on real-world traffic datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they mention two datasets:

1. **SZ-taxi Dataset**: This dataset consists of taxi trajectory data from Shenzhen, covering the period from January 1 to January 31, 2015. It includes an adjacency matrix representing the spatial relationships between 156 major roads in the Luohu District and a feature matrix detailing traffic speed changes over time, aggregated every 15 minutes.

2. **Los-loop Dataset**: This dataset was collected from loop detectors on highways in Los Angeles County, covering the period from March 1 to March 7, 2012. It includes data from 207 sensors, with traffic speed aggregated every 5 minutes. The adjacency matrix is calculated based on the distances between sensors, and missing values were filled using linear interpolation.

To ensure accuracy, I will also check the **References section** for full citations related to these datasets. However, in this case, the datasets are described in detail within the paper itself, and specific citations for the datasets are not provided. Therefore, I will summarize the datasets based on the information given in the experiments section.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the names, descriptions, and any relevant details as outlined in the paper. The full citations for the datasets may not be available, but I will document the datasets as described.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will prepare the dataset entries for further processing or review.
