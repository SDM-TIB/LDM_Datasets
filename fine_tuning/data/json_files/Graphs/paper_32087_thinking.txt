To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Subgraph Networks Based Contrastive Learning" by Jinhuan Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors compare their method with classical and state-of-the-art graph contrastive learning methods on multiple benchmark datasets. This indicates that datasets are likely discussed further in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments** section. In this paper, there are two tables (Table I and Table II) that provide statistics for datasets used in both unsupervised learning and transfer learning tasks. 

In **Table I**, the following datasets are listed for the unsupervised learning task:

1. **MUTAG**: Contains 188 graphs, with an average of 17.93 nodes and 19.79 edges.
2. **PTC-MR**: Contains 344 graphs, with an average of 14.29 nodes and 14.69 edges.
3. **NCI1**: Contains 4,110 graphs, with an average of 29.87 nodes and 32.30 edges.
4. **PROTEINS**: Contains 1,113 graphs, with an average of 39.06 nodes and 72.82 edges.
5. **DD**: Contains 1,178 graphs, with an average of 284.32 nodes and 715.66 edges.
6. **REDDIT-BINARY**: Contains 2,000 graphs, with an average of 429.63 nodes and 497.75 edges.
7. **IMDB-BINARY**: Contains 1,000 graphs, with an average of 19.77 nodes and 96.53 edges.
8. **IMDB-MULTI**: Contains 1,500 graphs, with an average of 13.00 nodes and 65.93 edges.

In **Table II**, the datasets for the transfer learning task are listed:

1. **ZINC-2M**: Contains 2,000,000 graphs, with an average of 26.62 nodes and 57.72 edges.
2. **BBBP**: Contains 2,039 graphs, with an average of 24.06 nodes and 51.90 edges.
3. **Tox21**: Contains 7,831 graphs, with an average of 18.57 nodes and 38.58 edges.
4. **ToxCAST**: Contains 8,576 graphs, with an average of 18.78 nodes and 38.52 edges.
5. **SIDER**: Contains 1,427 graphs, with an average of 33.64 nodes and 70.71 edges.
6. **CLINTOX**: Contains 1,477 graphs, with an average of 26.15 nodes and 55.76 edges.
7. **MUV**: Contains 93,087 graphs, with an average of 24.23 nodes and 52.55 edges.
8. **HIV**: Contains 41,127 graphs, with an average of 25.51 nodes and 54.93 edges.
9. **BACE**: Contains 1,513 graphs, with an average of 34.08 nodes and 73.71 edges.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. The paper cites the TU dataset as the source for the datasets used in the experiments. The citation for the TU dataset is:

- **TUdataset**: 
  > Morris, C., Kriege, N. M., Bause, F., Kersting, K., Mutzel, P., & Neumann, M. (2020). *TUDataset: A collection of benchmark datasets for learning with graphs*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2007.08663.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations. 

After completing this process, I will have a structured list of datasets extracted from the paper, along with their full citations, ready for further use or analysis.
