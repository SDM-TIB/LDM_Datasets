To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Cross-Scale Internal Graph Neural Network for Image Super-Resolution" by Shangchen Zhou et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for training and evaluation. In this section, they mention using **800 high-quality images from the DIV2K dataset** as the training set. This is a clear indication of a dataset being utilized.

I will also look for any additional datasets mentioned in the context of evaluation metrics. The authors state that they evaluate their models on five standard benchmarks: **Set5, Set14, BSD100, Urban100, and Manga109**. Each of these benchmarks is likely to be associated with specific datasets.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. **DIV2K Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Radu Timofte, Eirikur Agustsson, Luc Van Gool, Ming-Hsuan Yang, and Lei Zhang. *NTIRE 2017 Challenge on Single Image Super-Resolution: Methods and Results*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2017.

2. **Set5 Dataset**: The citation is:
   > David Martin, Charless Fowlkes, Doron Tal, and Jitendra Malik. *A Database of Human Segmented Natural Images and Its Application to Evaluating Segmentation Algorithms and Measuring Ecological Statistics*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2001.

3. **Set14 Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Roman Zeyde, Michael Elad, and Matan Protter. *On Single Image Scale-Up Using Sparse Representations*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Computer Science (ICCS), 2010.

4. **BSD100 Dataset**: The citation is:
   > David Martin, Charless Fowlkes, Doron Tal, and Jitendra Malik. *A Database of Human Segmented Natural Images and Its Application to Evaluating Segmentation Algorithms and Measuring Ecological Statistics*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2001.

5. **Urban100 Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Jia-Bin Huang, Abhishek Singh, and Narendra Ahuja. *Single Image Super-Resolution from Transformed Self-Exemplars*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2015.

6. **Manga109 Dataset**: The citation is:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations to ensure that all relevant details are documented accurately. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
