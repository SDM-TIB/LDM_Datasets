To extract datasets from the research paper titled "PolicyClusterGCN: Identifying Efficient Clusters for Training Graph Convolutional Networks" by Saket Gurukar et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on six real-world datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors provide statistics for the datasets used in their experiments. This section is likely to contain the names and details of the datasets, including the number of nodes, edges, features, and the train/validation/test splits.

In this section, I find the following datasets mentioned:

1. **Romania Dataset**: Contains 41,773 nodes and 996,404 edges, with 16 features. The dataset is split into training, validation, and test sets with proportions of 60%, 10%, and 30%, respectively.

2. **Hungary Dataset**: Contains 47,538 nodes and 445,774 edges, also with 16 features and the same split proportions as the Romania dataset.

3. **Croatia Dataset**: Contains 54,573 nodes and 251,652 edges, with 16 features and the same split proportions.

4. **Twitter Dataset**: Contains 37,154 nodes and 88,234 edges, with 6 features and a split of 55%, 20%, and 25%.

5. **Facebook Dataset**: Contains 9,073 nodes and 84,000 edges, with 6 features and the same split proportions as the Twitter dataset.

6. **Blogcatalog Dataset**: Contains 5,196 nodes and 343,486 edges, with 6 features and a split of 55%, 20%, and 25%.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The authors reference multiple papers for the datasets, which I will need to compile:

- For the **Romania, Hungary, and Croatia datasets**, the citation is:
  > Benedek Rozemberczki, Ryan Davies, Rik Sarkar, and Charles Sutton. *Gemsec: Graph embedding with self clustering*. In Proceedings of the 2019 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Advances in Social Networks Analysis and Mining, pages 65–72, 2019.

- For the **Twitter and Facebook datasets**, the citation is:
  > Tiantian He and Keith CC Chan. *Discovering fuzzy structural patterns for graph analytics*. IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems, 26(5):2785–2796, 2018.

- For the **Blogcatalog dataset**, the citation is:
  > Xiao Huang, Jundong Li, and Xia Hu. *Accelerated attributed network embedding*. In Proceedings of the 2017 SIAM International Conference on Data Mining, pages 633–641. SIAM, 2017.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will summarize the information for each dataset, ensuring to include the full citation as required.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that is ready for review or further processing.
