To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Simulation and Augmentation of Social Networks for Building Deep Learning Models" by Akanda Wahid-Ul-Ashraf et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the need for high-quality synthetic social network data with ground truth labels and features, indicating that datasets are a central focus of the research.

Next, I will look for explicit mentions of datasets in the **introduction**. The authors highlight the lack of comprehensive guidelines for simulating social networks with features and labels, which suggests that they may provide details on datasets later in the paper.

In the **methodology section**, I will pay close attention to any subsections that describe the simulation process or the datasets used. The authors mention that they simulate 30 social networks with 1,000 nodes each, and each network has four different types of social DNA (sDNA) with 250 nodes subscribing to a single type. This indicates that the simulated networks themselves are a dataset.

I will also check the **results and discussion sections** to see if the authors refer to any specific datasets used for validation or comparison purposes. They mention evaluating their models on simulated datasets, which reinforces the idea that the datasets are synthetic and generated as part of their research.

Finally, I will consult the **references section** to find any citations related to the datasets or methodologies they used for simulation. If they reference any existing datasets or frameworks, I will note those citations as well.

Based on this analysis, I will compile the following datasets:

1. **Simulated Social Networks**: The authors created 30 synthetic social networks, each with 1,000 nodes and four types of sDNA. This dataset is crucial for their experiments and validation of the proposed models.

2. **Social Network Simulation Library**: The authors mention an open-source Python-based library for simulating social networks, which may also be considered a dataset as it provides the means to generate various social network configurations.

Now, I will gather the full citations for any referenced datasets or methodologies mentioned in the paper. If the authors cite any foundational works or frameworks that contributed to their simulation methods, I will include those citations as well.

After compiling this information, I will summarize the datasets and their citations clearly for future reference or processing.
