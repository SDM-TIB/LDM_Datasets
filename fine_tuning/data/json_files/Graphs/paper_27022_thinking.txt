To extract datasets from the research paper titled "AdCo: Adversarial Contrast for Efficient Learning of Unsupervised Representations from Self-Trained Negative Adversaries" by Qianjiang Hu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the performance of the AdCo model on ImageNet, which suggests that ImageNet might be one of the datasets used.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for any explicit mentions of datasets. The introduction discusses unsupervised representation learning and mentions the importance of contrastive learning methods, but I need to look for specific dataset names.

I will then check the **experiments section** (Section 5) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for training and evaluation. In this section, they mention using **ImageNet** for unsupervised pretraining and evaluate the model on various downstream tasks, including classification on the VOC dataset and object detection on the COCO dataset.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. **ImageNet**: The citation for the ImageNet dataset is:
   > Olga Russakovsky, Jia Deng, Hao Sheng, et al. *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 115(3):211-252, 2015.

2. **VOC Dataset**: The citation for the VOC dataset is:
   > Mark Everingham, Luc Van Gool, Christopher KI Williams, John Winn, and Andrew Zisserman. *The Pascal Visual Object Classes (VOC) Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 88(2):303-338, 2010.

3. **COCO Dataset**: The citation for the COCO dataset is:
   > Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, Serge Belongie, et al. *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. In European Conference on Computer Vision, pages 740-755, 2014.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
