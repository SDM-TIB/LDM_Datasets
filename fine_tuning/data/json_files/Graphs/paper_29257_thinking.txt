To extract datasets from the research paper titled "TGL: A General Framework for Temporal GNN Training on Billion-Scale Graphs" by Hongkuan Zhou et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors introduce two large-scale datasets with billions of temporal edges, which suggests that these datasets are crucial to the research.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors discuss the limitations of existing Temporal Graph Neural Networks (TGNNs) and the need for large-scale datasets. They mention that they will evaluate their framework on two large datasets, which I need to identify.

In the **experiments section**, specifically **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, the authors provide a table summarizing the statistics of the datasets used. They mention six datasets, including two large-scale datasets: **GDELT** and **MAG**. I will extract the details for these datasets:

1. **GDELT**: This dataset is described as a Temporal Knowledge Graph that records events from news articles in over 100 languages. It includes nodes representing actors and temporal edges representing events, with specific features for nodes and edges.

2. **MAG**: This dataset is a homogeneous sub-graph of the MAG240M graph, focusing on paper-paper citations. Each node represents an academic paper, and the edges represent citations with timestamps.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The paper cites the following:

- For **GDELT**, the citation is:
  > Kalev Leetaru and Philip A. Schrodt. *GDELT: Global data on events, location, and tone*. ISA Annual Convention, 2013. http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.686.6605

- For **MAG**, the citation is:
  > Weihua Hu, Matthias Fey, Hongyu Ren, Maho Nakata, Yuxiao Dong, and Jure Leskovec. *OGB-LSC: A Large-Scale Challenge for Machine Learning on Graphs*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2103.09430, 2021.

With this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.
