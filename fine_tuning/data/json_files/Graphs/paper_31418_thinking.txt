To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Human-AI Collaboration: The Effect of AI Delegation on Human Task Performance and Task Satisfaction" by Monika Westphal et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, but I need to look for specific datasets used in the experiments.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the context of AI delegation and its implications, but they do not mention specific datasets. I will move on to the **methodology section**, where the authors describe the experimental design and the data used.

In **section 4.1 (Data)**, the authors specify that they used a modified subset of the **ImageNet dataset** for their study. They mention that this dataset consists of 1,200 images equally balanced over 16 classes, which is crucial information for understanding the dataset's structure and purpose.

Next, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the ImageNet dataset. The relevant citation is:

- **ImageNet dataset**:
  > Olga Russakovsky, Jia Deng, Hao Su, Jonathan Krause, Sanjeev Satheesh, Sean Ma, Zhiheng Huang, Andrej Karpathy, Aditya Khosla, Michael Bernstein, Alexander C Berg, and Li Fei-Fei. *ImageNet large scale visual recognition challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 115(3):211â€“252, 2015. https://doi.org/10.1007/s11263-015-0816-y.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the findings related to the dataset in a structured manner, ensuring that I include the full citation for the ImageNet dataset as it is essential for proper attribution.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format that can be used for further analysis or reference.
