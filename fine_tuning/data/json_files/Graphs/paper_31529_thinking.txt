To extract datasets from the research paper titled "GRAF: Graph Attention-aware Fusion Networks" by Ziynet Nesibe Kesimoglu and Serdar Bozdag, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors applied their method to four datasets from different domains, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, particularly **subsection 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of each dataset used in their experiments. Here, they mention four datasets:

1. **IMDB Dataset**: This dataset is used for movie genre prediction and includes three node types (movie, actor, director) and two associations (movie-actor, movie-director). The dataset contains 85,358 edges.

2. **ACM Dataset**: This dataset is utilized for paper type prediction and consists of three node types (paper, author, subject) with two associations (paper-author, paper-subject). It has 2,210,761 edges.

3. **DBLP Dataset**: This dataset is for author research area prediction and includes four node types (paper, author, conference, term) and three associations (paper-author, paper-conference, paper-term). It has 5,000,495 edges.

4. **DrugADR Dataset**: This dataset is used for predicting adverse drug reactions and includes drug-ADR pairs. It has four drug similarity networks based on different similarity measures and contains 8,158 edges.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The paper provides specific references for the datasets used:

- For the **IMDB Dataset**, the citation is:
  > IMDB data collected from PyTorch Geometric library. Available at: https://www.imdb.com.

- For the **ACM Dataset**, the citation is:
  > ACM data collected using Deep Graph Library. Available at: http://dl.acm.org.

- For the **DBLP Dataset**, the citation is:
  > DBLP data collected from [19] and preprocessed data using [20]. Available at: https://dblp.uni-trier.de/.

- For the **DrugADR Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Drug-ADR pairs collected from ADReCS (v3.1). Available at: https://www.adrecs.org.

Now that I have the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. Each dataset will be clearly described along with its citation to ensure proper attribution.
