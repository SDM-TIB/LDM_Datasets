To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Domain Confused Contrastive Learning for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation" by Quanyu Long et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, and the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **experiments section (Section 4)**, the authors explicitly mention two datasets:

1. **Amazon Benchmark**: This dataset is referenced as containing four domains: Book, DVD, Electronics, and Kitchen housewares. The authors state that there are 2,000 balanced labeled data for each domain and that they randomly selected 20,000 unlabeled reviews for three of the domains and 17,856 for Kitchen housewares.

2. **Amazon Review Dataset**: This dataset is described as containing neutral instances, which adds complexity to the adaptation task. It also consists of four domains: Book, Electronics, Beauty, and Music. The authors mention that they treat one set as labeled (6,000 instances) and another set as unlabeled (also 6,000 instances).

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

- For the **Amazon Benchmark**, the citation is:
  > Blitzer, J., Dredze, M., & Pereira, F. (2007). Biographies, Bollywood, boom-boxes and blenders: Domain adaptation for sentiment classification. In Proceedings of the 45th Annual Meeting of the Association of Computational Linguistics (pp. 440-447). Prague, Czech Republic: Association for Computational Linguistics.

- For the **Amazon Review Dataset**, the citation is:
  > He, R., Lee, W. S., Ng, H. T., & Dahlmeier, D. (2018). Adaptive semi-supervised learning for cross-domain sentiment classification. In Proceedings of the 2018 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (pp. 3467-3476). Brussels, Belgium: Association for Computational Linguistics.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset, its description, and its citation. This will ensure that the datasets are accurately represented and easily accessible for future reference.
