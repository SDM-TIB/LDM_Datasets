To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Critical Examination of RESCAL for Completion of Knowledge Bases with Transitive Relations" by Pushpendre Rastogi and Benjamin Van Durme, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses link prediction in knowledge graphs and mentions empirical results on various datasets, which suggests that datasets are likely included in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 3) where the authors describe their methodology and the datasets used for testing the RESCAL model. In this section, they mention two specific datasets:

1. **Simulated Data**: The authors describe a simulated dataset created from a complete, balanced, rooted, directed binary tree. They provide details about the number of vertices and edges, which indicates that this dataset is constructed for their experiments.

2. **WordNet**: The authors also mention using the WordNet dataset, specifically focusing on the hyponymy relations. They describe how they extracted a subtree rooted at the "living thing" synset, detailing the number of hyponyms and edges involved.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **WordNet**, the citation is:
  > George A. Miller. 1995. *WordNet: A lexical database for English*. Communications of the ACM, 38(11):39â€“41.

The simulated dataset does not have a formal citation since it is a synthetic dataset created for the purpose of the experiments. However, I will note its description for completeness.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its citation where applicable. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.
