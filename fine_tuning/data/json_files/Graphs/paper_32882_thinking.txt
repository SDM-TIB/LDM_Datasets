To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Incorporating Domain Knowledge Graph into Multimodal Movie Genre Classification with Self-Supervised Attention and Contrastive Learning" by Jiaqi Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors created a new dataset called **MM-IMDb 2.0**, which is a significant clue that there are datasets to extract.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **introduction**. The authors state that they collected a larger and more challenging dataset named **MM-IMDb 2.0** compared to the existing **MM-IMDb dataset**. This suggests that both datasets are relevant for extraction.

In the **experiments section**, the authors explicitly mention using both the **MM-IMDb** and **MM-IMDb 2.0** datasets for their evaluations. They provide details about the number of movies in each dataset, which is crucial for understanding their scope.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The paper cites the original source of the **MM-IMDb dataset**, which is essential for proper attribution. 

The citations I need to extract are:

1. **MM-IMDb Dataset**: 
   > John Arevalo, Thamar Solorio, Manuel Montes-y Gómez, and Fabio A González. *Gated multimodal units for information fusion*. In ICLR, 2017.

2. **MM-IMDb 2.0 Dataset**: 
   The authors created this dataset, so I will cite it as follows:
   > Jiaqi Li, Guilin Qi, Chuanyi Zhang, Yongrui Chen, Yiming Tan, Chenlong Xia, and Ye Tian. *Incorporating Domain Knowledge Graph into Multimodal Movie Genre Classification with Self-Supervised Attention and Contrastive Learning*. In Proceedings of the 31st ACM International Conference on Multimedia (MM ’23), October 29-November 3, 2023, Ottawa, ON, Canada. ACM, New York, NY, USA, 9 pages. https://doi.org/10.1145/3581783.3612085

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations. This will ensure that all necessary details are captured for future reference or analysis.
