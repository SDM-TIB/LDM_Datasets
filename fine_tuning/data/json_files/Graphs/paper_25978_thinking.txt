To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Representation Learning on Graphs: A Reinforcement Learning Application" by Sephora Madjiheurem and Laura Toni, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study but does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will focus on the introduction and experiments sections for more detailed information.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of reinforcement learning in high-dimensional spaces but do not specify any datasets. I will then move to the **experiments section** where the authors describe the environments used for their experiments.

In **section 4.1 (Set up)**, the authors mention two environments used for their experiments:

1. **Two-room environment**: This environment consists of 100 states, divided into 57 accessible states and 43 inaccessible states representing walls. The goal state is marked in red, and the agent receives a reward for reaching this state.

2. **Obstacles-room environment**: This environment also consists of 100 states, with some inaccessible due to walls and others accessible with a fixed probability. The agent is rewarded for reaching a specific goal state.

These environments are not traditional datasets but rather simulated environments created for the purpose of the experiments. However, they are crucial for understanding the context of the research.

Next, I will check the **References section** to see if any datasets or environments are cited that could be relevant to the experiments. The references primarily cite foundational works in reinforcement learning and graph representation learning, but they do not provide specific datasets.

Since the paper does not reference any external datasets but rather describes custom environments, I will summarize the environments as follows:

1. **Two-room environment**: A simulated environment with 100 states (57 accessible, 43 inaccessible), used to evaluate the proposed methods.

2. **Obstacles-room environment**: Another simulated environment with 100 states, some of which are inaccessible, used for testing the algorithms.

Since these environments are not standard datasets with formal citations, I will note that they are custom experimental setups created by the authors.

Finally, I will compile the information about the environments into a structured format for clarity, ensuring to highlight that they are not traditional datasets with citations but rather experimental setups used in the study.
