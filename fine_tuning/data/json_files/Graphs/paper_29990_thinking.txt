To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Criteria Comparative Learning for Real-scene Image Super-Resolution" by Yukai Shi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of real-world image super-resolution and mention the need for datasets that reflect these challenges. This indicates that datasets are likely to be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically looking for any subsection that discusses datasets. In this paper, the authors explicitly mention several datasets used for their experiments:

1. **RealSR-Zero**: This dataset consists of 45 low-resolution images captured by an iPhone4, collected from the internet, with a shooting period from 2011 to 2013. The authors note that only poor-quality images are provided for evaluation.

2. **RealSR**: This dataset includes 595 low-resolution and high-resolution image pairs. The authors used 200 pairs for training and 50 pairs collected by a Canon camera for testing.

3. **NTIRE2020 Challenge**: This dataset contains 3,550 images that have been downscaled with unknown noise to simulate inherent optical sensor noise. The authors used 3,450 images for training and 100 images from the DIV2K validation set for testing.

4. **CameraSR**: This dataset consists of 200 low-resolution and high-resolution pairs collected by mobile phones and Nikon cameras. The authors used 80 real-scene photos for training and 20 pairs for evaluation.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations for the datasets mentioned in the paper are as follows:

- **RealSR-Zero**: The dataset is described in the paper itself, so no external citation is needed.
  
- **RealSR**: 
  > Cai, J., Zeng, H., Yong, H., Cao, Z., & Zhang, L. (2019). *Toward real-world single image super-resolution: A new benchmark and a new model*. arXiv:1904.00523.

- **NTIRE2020 Challenge**: 
  > Lugmayr, A., Danelljan, M., Timofte, R., et al. (2020). *NTIRE 2020 challenge on real-world image super-resolution: Methods and results*. In CVPRW.

- **CameraSR**: 
  > Chen, C., Xiong, Z., Tian, X., Zha, Z., & Wu, F. (2019). *Camera lens super-resolution*. In CVPR.

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, I will compile this into a structured format for further processing or review.
