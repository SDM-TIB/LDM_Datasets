To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Graph Neural Operators for Classification of Spatial Transcriptomics Data" by Junaid Ahmed and Alhassan S. Yasin, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, but I will need to look deeper for specific dataset mentions.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the application of graph learning approaches in spatial transcriptomics but do not mention specific datasets. I will proceed to the **materials and methods section** where the authors describe their dataset selection criteria.

In **section 2.1 (Dataset)**, the authors mention that they used a central repository of curated spatial transcriptomics datasets. They specifically highlight the **mouse brain atlas dataset**, which contains about 34,000 spots and 23,000 genes with 75 samples. This dataset meets their research requirements and is crucial for their analysis.

Next, I will look for the **references section** to find the full citation for the mouse brain atlas dataset. The citation provided in the references is:

> Ortiz, C., Navarro, J., Jurek, A., MÃ¤rtin, A., Lundeberg, J., & Meletis, K. (2020). *Molecular atlas of the adult mouse brain*. Science Advances, 6(26).

Additionally, the authors mention a central repository for curated spatial transcriptomics datasets, which is referenced as:

> Xu, Z., Wang, W., Yang, T., Chen, J., Huang, Y., Gould, J., Du, W., Yang, F., Li, L., Lai, T., Hua, C., Hu, S., Cai, J., Li, H., You, L., Zeng, W., Wang, B., Liu, L., Xu, X., Chen, F., & Wei, X. (2022). *Stomicsdb: a database of spatial transcriptomic data*. bioRxiv.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. The key dataset extracted is the mouse brain atlas dataset, which is central to the research findings presented in the paper.
