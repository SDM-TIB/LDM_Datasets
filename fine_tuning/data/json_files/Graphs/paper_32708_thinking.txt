To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Visual Question Answering in the Medical Domain" by Louisa Canepa et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the paper discusses the Med-VQA task and mentions the lack of large-scale annotated datasets, which suggests that datasets are a key focus.

In the **introduction**, the authors reference the **ImageCLEF Med-VQA 2018 challenge**, which implies the existence of a dataset associated with this challenge. I will look for specific dataset names and details in the subsequent sections.

Next, I will focus on **section III (Methodology)**, where the authors explicitly mention using the **VQA-Med 2019 challenge dataset**. This section provides a detailed description of the dataset, stating that it consists of 4,200 images from the MedPix database and includes 15,992 corresponding question and answer pairs. The authors also categorize the questions into four types: modality, plane, abnormality, and organ system.

I will also note that the authors mention using the **Radiology Objects in COntext (ROCO) dataset** for pretraining the image encoder. This dataset consists of over 81,000 radiology images in various imaging modalities, which is relevant for the Med-VQA task.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **VQA-Med 2019 dataset**, the citation is:
   > Abacha, A. B., Hasan, S. A., Datla, V. V., Liu, J., Demner-Fushman, D., & Müller, H. (2019). VQA-Med: Overview of the medical visual question answering task at ImageCLEF 2019. In CLEF (Working Notes).

2. For the **ROCO dataset**, the citation is:
   > Pelka, O., Koitka, S., Rückert, J., Nensa, F., & Friedrich, C. M. (2018). Radiology objects in context (ROCO): a multimodal image dataset. In Intravascular Imaging and Computer Assisted Stenting and Large-Scale Annotation of Biomedical Data and Expert Label Synthesis. Springer, pp. 180–189.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

- **VQA-Med 2019 dataset**: A dataset consisting of 4,200 images and 15,992 question-answer pairs, categorized into four types of questions relevant to medical visual question answering.
- **ROCO dataset**: A large dataset containing over 81,000 radiology images across various modalities, used for pretraining the image encoder.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly presents the datasets and their citations for further use or analysis.
