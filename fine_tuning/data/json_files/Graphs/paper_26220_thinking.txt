To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Learning Algorithms to Isolate and Quantify the Structures of the Anterior Segment in Optical Coherence Tomography Images" by Tan Hung Pham et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract highlights the development of a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) for analyzing optical coherence tomography (OCT) images, which suggests that there may be datasets involved.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly the subsection titled **ASOCT imaging**. Here, the authors mention that they included ASOCT images from patients examined at the Eye Surgery Centre, National University Hospital, Singapore. They state that they obtained scans from 100 patients (175 eyes) and used 620 images for training and 200 images for testing. This indicates that there is a dataset derived from these ASOCT images.

In the **results section**, the authors discuss the performance of their model using the ASOCT dataset, confirming its significance in their experiments. However, they do not provide a specific name for the dataset, so I will refer to it as the "ASOCT Dataset" for clarity.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find any citations related to the datasets used. The paper does not cite any external datasets but rather describes the dataset they collected from their own study. Therefore, I will create a citation for the dataset based on the authors and the context provided in the paper.

The citation for the ASOCT dataset will be:
> Pham, T. H., Devalla, S. K., Ang, A., Cheng, C. Y., Koh, V., & Girard, M. J. A. (2019). Deep Learning Algorithms to Isolate and Quantify the Structures of the Anterior Segment in Optical Coherence Tomography Images. *Journal of Biomedical Optics*, 24(9), 1-10.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including the name and citation, into a structured format for further use.

In summary, the steps I followed are:
1. Read through the abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections to identify datasets.
2. Focus on the methods section for specific details about the dataset.
3. Confirm the dataset's significance in the results section.
4. Create a citation based on the authors and context provided in the paper.
5. Compile the dataset information for structured output.
