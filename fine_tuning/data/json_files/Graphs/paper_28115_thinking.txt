To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Neighborhood Consensus Contrastive Learning for Backward-Compatible Representation" by Shengsen Wu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on evaluated benchmark datasets, which suggests that specific datasets are used.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they explicitly mention three datasets:

1. **Market-1501**: This dataset consists of 32,668 annotated images of 1,501 identities captured from six different cameras. It is widely used for person re-identification tasks.

2. **MSMT17**: This is a large-scale re-identification dataset containing 126,441 bounding boxes of 4,101 identities taken by 15 cameras. It is another benchmark for evaluating re-identification methods.

3. **VeRi-776**: This dataset contains over 50,000 images of 776 vehicles captured by 20 cameras, specifically designed for vehicle re-identification tasks.

Additionally, the authors mention using **ImageNet** and **Place365** datasets to demonstrate the scalability of their method. ImageNet contains more than 1.2 million images with 1,000 classes, while Place365 has about 1.8 million images with 365 classes.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Market-1501**, the citation is:

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations for further processing or review.
