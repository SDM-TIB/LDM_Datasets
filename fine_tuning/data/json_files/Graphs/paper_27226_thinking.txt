To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Pneumonia Detection on Chest X-Ray Using Radiomic Features and Contrastive Learning" by Yan Han et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on the **RSNA Pneumonia Detection Challenge dataset**, which indicates that this dataset is significant for their research.

Next, I will look into **section 4.1 (Dataset and Experimental Settings)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they specifically mention the **RSNA Pneumonia Detection Challenge dataset**, describing it as containing **30,227 frontal-view images**, with **9,783 images** having pneumonia annotations and corresponding bounding boxes. This section confirms that this dataset is central to their study.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the RSNA Pneumonia Detection Challenge dataset. The citation is as follows:
> George Shih, Carol C Wu, Safwan S Halabi, Marc D Kohli, Luciano M Prevedello, Tessa S Cook, Arjun Sharma, Judith K Amorosa, Veronica Arteaga, Maya Galperin-Aizenberg, et al. "Augmenting the national institutes of health chest radiograph dataset with expert annotations of possible pneumonia." *Radiology: Artificial Intelligence*, vol. 1, no. 1, pp. e180041, 2019.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets explicitly, I will conclude my extraction process here. 

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and full citation, ensuring that all details are accurately represented for future reference or processing.
