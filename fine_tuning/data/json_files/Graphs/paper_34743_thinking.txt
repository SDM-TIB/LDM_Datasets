To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Revisiting Modularity Maximization for Graph Clustering: A Contrastive Learning Perspective" by Yunfei Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract indicates that extensive experiments were conducted on multiple graph datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will look into **section 5 (Experiments)**, as this section typically contains information about the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, the authors explicitly list the datasets along with their statistics in **Table 1**. The datasets mentioned are:

1. **Cora**: A citation network dataset with 2,708 nodes, 5,278 edges, and 1,433 features, containing 7 clusters.
2. **CiteSeer**: Another citation network dataset with 3,327 nodes, 4,614 edges, and 3,703 features, containing 6 clusters.
3. **Amazon-Photo**: A dataset with 7,650 nodes, 119,081 edges, and 745 features, containing 8 clusters.
4. **Amazon-Computers**: This dataset has 13,752 nodes, 491,722 edges, and 767 features, containing 10 clusters.
5. **ogbn-arxiv**: A large-scale dataset with 169,343 nodes, 1,166,243 edges, and 128 features, containing 40 clusters.
6. **Reddit**: A dataset with 232,965 nodes, 23,213,838 edges, and 602 features, containing 41 clusters.
7. **ogbn-products**: This dataset has 2,449,029 nodes, 61,859,140 edges, and 100 features, containing 47 clusters.
8. **ogbn-papers100M**: An extra-large dataset with 111,059,956 nodes, 1,615,685,872 edges, and 128 features, containing 172 clusters.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

With this information, I can now compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited.
