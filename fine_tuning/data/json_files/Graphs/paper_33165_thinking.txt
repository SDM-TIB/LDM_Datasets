To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Complexity-Guided Curriculum Learning for Text Graphs" by Nidhi Vakil and Hadi Amiri, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the effectiveness of the proposed curriculum learning approach on several text graph tasks and mentions "real-world datasets," which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will look into **section 3 (Experiments)**, as this section typically contains information about the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors explicitly list several datasets:

1. **Ogbn-arxiv**: This dataset is described as a citation network of computer science articles, with each paper categorized into one of 40 categories and provided with an embedding vector of size 128.

2. **Cora**: This is a smaller citation network where papers are categorized into one of seven subject categories, with features derived from the content of the papers.

3. **Citeseer**: Another citation network of scientific articles, classified into six classes, with a specific data split referenced.

4. **Gene, Disease, Phenotype Relation (GDPR)**: A large-scale dataset for predicting causal relations between genes and diseases based on text descriptions.

5. **Gene Phenotype Relation (PGR)**: This dataset focuses on extracting relations between genes and phenotypes from short sentences, with a note that a validation set was generated from the training data.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and further exploration of the datasets.

The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- **Ogbn-arxiv**:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or analysis. This process ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets referenced in the paper along with their proper citations.
