To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-Objective Interpolation Training for Robustness to Label Noise" by Diego Ortego et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the proposed method and hints at the datasets used for evaluation. The introduction may also contain references to datasets that are relevant to the study.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors typically provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used in their experiments. In this section, I will look for specific names, descriptions, and any relevant statistics about the datasets.

From my reading of section 4.1, I note that the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **CIFAR-10/100**: This dataset consists of 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images, with small resolution images for image classification tasks. The authors specify that they follow the noise addition criteria from previous works.

2. **mini-ImageNet**: This dataset is used for evaluating the method in a real-world scenario with web noise. It consists of 100 classes with 50,000 training samples and 5,000 validation samples.

3. **mini-WebVision**: This dataset is mentioned as another evaluation benchmark that uses the top-50 classes from the Google image subset of WebVision.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations I will extract are:

- For **CIFAR-10/100**:
  > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. Technical report, University of Toronto, 2009.

- For **mini-ImageNet**:
  > V. Vinyals, C. Blundell, T. Lillicrap, and D. Wierstra. *Matching Networks for One Shot Learning*. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS), 2016.

- For **mini-WebVision**:
  > W. Li, L. Wang, W. Li, E. Agustsson, and L. Van Gool. *WebVision Database: Visual Learning and Understanding from Web Data*. arXiv: 1708.02862, 2017.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset, its description, and the corresponding citation. This will ensure that the datasets are accurately represented and properly credited in any subsequent analysis or application.
