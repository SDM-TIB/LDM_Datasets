To extract datasets from the research paper titled "From First-Order to Higher-Order Interactions: Enhanced Representation of Homotopic Functional Connectivity Through Control of Intervening Variables" by Behdad Khodabandehloo et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the use of "resting-state fMRI from the Human Connectome Project (HCP)," which indicates that this dataset is relevant to the study.

Next, I will focus on the **Methods section**, specifically **section 2.1 (Dataset)**, where the authors describe the dataset used for their analysis. They state that the analysis was conducted using resting-state fMRI time series of **100 independent subjects from the Human Connectome Project (HCP)**. This is a clear identification of the dataset being utilized.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Human Connectome Project dataset. The relevant citation is:

> David C. Van Essen, Kamil Ugurbil, Edward Auerbach, Deanna Barch, Timothy E.J. Behrens, Richard Bucholz, Acer Chang, Liyong Chen, Maurizio Corbetta, Sandra W. Curtiss, et al. *The Human Connectome Project: A Data Acquisition Perspective*. Neuroimage, 62(4):2222â€“2231, 2012.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will ensure that I have all necessary details to describe the dataset accurately. The dataset is the resting-state fMRI data from the Human Connectome Project, which includes data from 100 subjects.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly presents the dataset and its citation, ready for further processing or review.
