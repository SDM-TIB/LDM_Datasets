To extract datasets from the research paper titled "WeedCLR: Weed Contrastive Learning through Visual Representations with Class-Optimized Loss in Long-Tailed Datasets" by Alzayat Saleh et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their method on two public weed datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically **section 3 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they mention:

1. **DeepWeeds Dataset**: This dataset consists of 17,509 images capturing eight different weed species native to Australia. The images were collected from various rangeland environments across northern Australia.

2. **CottonWeedID15 Dataset**: This dataset contains 5,187 RGB images of 15 common weeds found in cotton fields in the southern U.S. states. The images were taken under natural field light conditions and at various stages of weed growth.

Both datasets are explicitly named and described, confirming their use in the experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **DeepWeeds Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Olsen, A., Konovalov, D.A., Philippa, B., Ridd, P., Wood, J.C., Johns, J., Banks, W., Girgenti, B., Kenny, O., Whinney, J., Calvert, B., Azghadi, M.R., White, R.D. (2019). DeepWeeds: A Multiclass Weed Species Image Dataset for Deep Learning. *Scientific Reports*, 9, 2058. doi:10.1038/s41598-018-38343-3.

- For the **CottonWeedID15 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Chen, D., Lu, Y., Li, Z., Young, S. (2022). Performance evaluation of deep transfer learning on multi-class identification of common weed species in cotton production systems. *Computers and Electronics in Agriculture*, 198, 107091. doi:10.1016/j.compag.2022.107091.

Having gathered the necessary information, I will now compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
