To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SA-GS: Scale-Adaptive Gaussian Splatting for Training-Free Anti-Aliasing" by Xiaowei Song et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments using various settings and datasets, which indicates that datasets are likely discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention evaluating their method on the **Mip-NeRF 360 dataset** and the **Blender dataset**. I will look for specific details about these datasets, such as their characteristics, sizes, and any relevant splits or configurations used in the experiments.

Upon reviewing the text, I find the following details:

1. **Mip-NeRF 360 Dataset**: This dataset is referenced multiple times throughout the experiments, indicating its significance. The authors mention that they used it for both zoom-in and zoom-out effects, and it is a well-known dataset in the field of neural radiance fields.

2. **Blender Dataset**: Similar to the Mip-NeRF 360 dataset, the Blender dataset is also used for evaluating the proposed method. The authors describe its use in multi-scale training and testing scenarios.

Now, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Mip-NeRF 360 dataset**, the citation is:
  > Barron, J.T., Mildenhall, B., Verbin, D., Srinivasan, P.P., Hedman, P. "Mip-nerf 360: Unbounded anti-aliased neural radiance fields." In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 5470–5479, 2022.

- For the **Blender dataset**, the citation is:
  > Mildenhall, B., Srinivasan, P.P., Tancik, M., Barron, J.T., Ramamoorthi, R., Ng, R. "Nerf: Representing scenes as neural radiance fields for view synthesis." Communications of the ACM, 65(1), 99–106, 2021.

With this information, I will now compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations as required. This structured approach allows me to systematically extract and document the datasets used in the research paper.
