To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Improving Event Representation via Simultaneous Weakly Supervised Contrastive Learning and Clustering" by Jun Gao et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research but may not contain specific dataset names. The introduction often discusses the context and may reference datasets used in prior work.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and any relevant details about their content or structure.

In the paper, the authors mention that the event data used for training is extracted from the **New York Times Gigaword Corpus** using the Open Information Extraction system Ollie. They filtered the events with frequencies less than 3, resulting in **4,029,877 distinct events**. This is a significant dataset, and I will note it down.

Additionally, they mention using the **MCNC dataset** for the transfer task, which is referenced as being adopted from Lee and Goldwasser (2019). I will need to find the full citation for this dataset as well.

Now, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for both datasets:

1. For the **New York Times Gigaword Corpus**, while the paper does not provide a specific citation, I can reference it as:
   > Mausam, Michael Schmitz, Stephen Soderland, Robert Bart, and Oren Etzioni. *Open language learning for information extraction*. In Proceedings of the 2012 Joint Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing and Computational Natural Language Learning, pages 523–534, Jeju Island, Korea, 2012.

2. For the **MCNC dataset**, I will look for the citation provided in the references. The relevant citation is:
   > Granroth-Wilding, M., & Clark, S. (2016). *What happens next? event prediction using a compositional neural network model*. In Proceedings of the Thirtieth AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, pages 2727–2733, Phoenix, Arizona, USA.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets in a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.
