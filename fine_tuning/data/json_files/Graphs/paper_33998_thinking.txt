To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Uncertainty-Aware Pseudo-Label Filtering for Source-Free Unsupervised Domain Adaptation" by Xi Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on three widely used benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Implementation)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention:

1. **Office Dataset**: This dataset consists of three domains (Amazon, Dslr, and Webcam) with 31 classes, specifically designed for office scenario tasks.

2. **Office-Home Dataset**: A medium-sized dataset that includes 65 classes across four domains: Art, Clipart, Product, and Real-World.

3. **VisDA-C Dataset**: A large dataset with 12 classes, used for the adaptation task from a synthetic domain to a real domain.

4. **DomainNet-126 Dataset**: A subset of the DomainNet dataset, which includes 126 classes from four domains (Real, Sketch, Clipart, Painting).

In the **experiments section**, the authors confirm that they evaluated their method on these datasets, reinforcing their relevance.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **Office Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Kate Saenko, Brian Kulis, Mario Fritz, and Trevor Darrell. *Adapting visual category models to new domains*. In Proceedings of the European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), pages 213–226, 2012.

- For the **Office-Home Dataset**, the citation is:
  > S. Venkateswara, J. Eusebio, S. Chakraborty, and S. Panchanathan. *Deep hashing network for unsupervised domain adaptation*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 5385–5394, 2017.

- For the **VisDA-C Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Xingchao Peng, Ben Usman, Neela Kaushik, Judy Hoffman, Dequan Wang, and Kate Saenko. *VisDA: The Visual Domain Adaptation Challenge*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2017.

- For the **DomainNet-126 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Xingchao Peng, Qinxun Bai, Xide Xia, Zijun Huang, Kate Saenko, and Bo Wang. *Moment matching for multi-source domain adaptation*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2019.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all details are accurately represented for future reference or processing.
