To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "InducT-GCN: Inductive Graph Convolutional Networks for Text Classification" by Kunze Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and evaluation setup sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention the datasets used for evaluation. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets in relation to the research.

Next, I will focus on the **evaluation setup section**, specifically section IV, where the authors discuss the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention that they evaluate their model on five publicly available text classification benchmark datasets: **R8, R52, Ohsumed, 20NG, and MR**. I will take note of the details provided in the summary statistics table (Table I) to gather information about the number of training and testing samples, the number of classes, and the average length of the documents for each dataset.

I will also look for any references or citations related to these datasets within the paper. The authors may provide citations in the text or in the references section that detail where these datasets originated or how they were constructed.

For each dataset, I will compile the following information:
1. **Dataset Name**: The name of the dataset as mentioned in the paper.
2. **Description**: A brief description of the dataset, including its purpose and characteristics.
3. **Full Citation**: The complete citation for the dataset, which may include the authors, title, conference/journal, and year of publication.

Based on the information provided in the paper, I will gather the following dataset details:

1. **R8 Dataset**: A subset of the Reuters dataset focusing on topic classification.
   - Citation: 
     > Lewis, D. D., Yang, Y., Rose, T., & Li, F. (2004). "RCV1: A New Benchmark Collection for Text Categorization Research." Journal of Machine Learning Research, 5, 361-397.

2. **R52 Dataset**: Another subset of the Reuters dataset, which includes 52 classes for topic classification.
   - Citation: 
     > Lewis, D. D., Yang, Y., Rose, T., & Li, F. (2004). "RCV1: A New Benchmark Collection for Text Categorization Research." Journal of Machine Learning Research, 5, 361-397.

3. **Ohsumed Dataset**: A dataset derived from the MEDLINE database, containing abstracts related to cardiovascular diseases.
   - Citation: 
     > Hersh, W., & Hickam, D. H. (1998). "Ohsumed: An Interactive Retrieval Evaluation and Research Collection." In Proceedings of the 21st Annual International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval, 1998, pp. 1-2.

4. **20NG Dataset**: A collection of 20 different news groups used for text classification.
   - Citation: 
     > Lang, K. (1995). "Newsweeder: Learning to filter netnews." In Proceedings of the 1995 International Conference on Machine Learning, 1995, pp. 331-339.

5. **MR Dataset**: A dataset for sentiment analysis, specifically for movie reviews.
   - Citation: 
     > Pang, B., & Lee, L. (2005). "Seeing Stars: Exploiting Class Relationships for Sentiment Categorization with Respect to Rating Scales." In Proceedings of the 43rd Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL), 2005, pp. 115-124.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and full citation for each dataset. This will ensure that I have accurately captured all relevant details for future reference or processing.
