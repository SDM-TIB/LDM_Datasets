To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Layer-stacked Attention for Heterogeneous Network Embedding" by Nhat Tran and Jean Gao, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for experiments. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly the part where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this paper, the authors mention conducting experiments on several benchmark heterogeneous network datasets and provide a summary table (Table 1) that lists the datasets along with their statistics.

From Table 1, I will extract the following datasets:

1. **DBLP**: This dataset is described as a heterogeneous network extracted from a bibliography dataset on major computer science journals and proceedings. It includes 14,328 papers, 4,057 authors, 20 conferences, and 8,789 terms. The relations considered are paper-author, paper-conference, and paper-term.

2. **ACM**: This dataset is a small citation network containing 3,025 papers, 5,835 authors, and 56 subjects. The relations are paper-author and paper-subject.

3. **IMDB**: This dataset is a movie database network containing 4,780 movies, 5,841 actors, and 2,269 directors. The relations are movie-actor and movie-director.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **DBLP**, the citation is:
  > DBLP. *DBLP Computer Science Bibliography*. Available at: https://dblp.uni-trier.de.

- For **ACM**, the citation is:
  > ACM. *ACM Digital Library*. Available at: https://dl.acm.org.

- For **IMDB**, the citation is:
  > Cantador, I., Brusilovsky, P., and Kuflik, T. (2011). *Second workshop on information heterogeneity and fusion in recommender systems (HetRec2011)*. In Proceedings of the fifth ACM conference on Recommender systems, 387â€“388.

Now that I have the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations.
