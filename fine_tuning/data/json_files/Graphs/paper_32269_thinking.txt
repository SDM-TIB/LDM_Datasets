To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Supervised Attention Using Homophily in Graph Neural Networks" by Michail Chatzianastasis, Giannis Nikolentzos, and Michalis Vazirgiannis, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions evaluating the proposed method on several node classification datasets, which indicates that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors discuss the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they explicitly list the datasets utilized in their experiments:

1. **Cora Dataset**: A citation network dataset where each node corresponds to a scientific publication, and edges represent citations. The goal is to predict the category of each publication.

2. **CiteSeer Dataset**: Similar to Cora, this dataset also consists of scientific publications and citations, used for the same classification task.

3. **Pubmed Dataset**: Another citation network dataset, where nodes represent publications and edges are citations, aimed at predicting publication categories.

4. **Disease Dataset**: A dataset simulating the SIR disease spreading model, where the label of a node indicates if it is infected or not.

In the **experimental setup**, the authors provide details on how they split the datasets for training, validation, and testing, confirming their usage in the experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Cora Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Sen, P., Namata, G., Bilgic, M., Getoor, L., Galligher, B., Eliassi-Rad, T. "Collective classification in network data." AI magazine 29(3), 93–93, 2008.

- For the **CiteSeer Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Sen, P., Namata, G., Bilgic, M., Getoor, L., Galligher, B., Eliassi-Rad, T. "Collective classification in network data." AI magazine 29(3), 93–93, 2008.

- For the **Pubmed Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Sen, P., Namata, G., Bilgic, M., Getoor, L., Galligher, B., Eliassi-Rad, T. "Collective classification in network data." AI magazine 29(3), 93–93, 2008.

- For the **Disease Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Anderson, R.M., May, R.M. "Infectious diseases of humans: dynamics and control." Oxford University Press, 1992.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing.
