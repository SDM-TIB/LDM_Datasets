To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Coupling Vision and Proprioception for Navigation of Legged Robots" by Zipeng Fu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention any datasets used for evaluation. In this case, the authors refer to using real-world Matterport 3D maps and other datasets for simulation benchmarks, which indicates that datasets are indeed involved.

Next, I will look into the **experiments** section, particularly focusing on the **simulation and real-world evaluation** subsections. Here, the authors mention importing real-world Matterport 3D maps used in Habitat and Gibson datasets into their simulation environment. This is crucial as it directly points to the datasets utilized in their experiments.

In the **References section**, I will locate the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper cites the following datasets:

1. **Matterport3D**: The citation is:
   > Angel Chang, Angela Dai, Thomas Funkhouser, Maciej Halber, Matthias Niessner, Manolis Savva, Shuran Song, Andy Zeng, and Yinda Zhang. *Matterport3D: Learning from RGB-D Data in Indoor Environments*. In 3DV, 2017.

2. **Gibson**: The citation is:
   > Fei Xia, Amir R. Zamir, Zhiyang He, Alexander Sax, Jitendra Malik, and Silvio Savarese. *Gibson Env: Real-World Perception for Embodied Agents*. In CVPR, 2018.

After identifying these datasets and their citations, I will summarize the key details about each dataset, including their purpose and any specific characteristics mentioned in the paper.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all information is accurately represented for future reference or processing.
