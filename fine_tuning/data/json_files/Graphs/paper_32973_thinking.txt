To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Topology-aware Debiased Self-supervised Graph Learning for Recommendation" by Lei Han et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the proposed model is evaluated on **three public datasets**, which indicates that I should look for specific dataset names and details.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this case, I find a table (Table I) that lists the datasets along with their statistics, including the number of users, items, interactions, and sparsity. The datasets mentioned are:

1. **Yelp2018**
2. **Movilens-1M**
3. **LastFM**

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **Yelp2018**, the citation is:
  > J. McAuley and J. Leskovec. *From Amateurs to Connoisseurs: Modeling the Evolution of User Expertise through Online Reviews*. In Proceedings of the 22nd ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, pages 1106–1115, 2016.

- For **Movilens-1M**, the citation is:
  > F. M. Harper and J. A. Konstan. *The Movielens Datasets: History and Context*. ACM Transactions on Interactive Intelligent Systems (TIIS), vol. 5, no. 4, pp. 1–19, 2015.

- For **LastFM**, the citation is:
  > I. Cantador, P. Brusilovsky, and T. Kuflik. *Second Workshop on Information Heterogeneity and Fusion in Recommender Systems (HETREC2011)*. In Proceedings of the Fifth ACM Conference on Recommender Systems, pages 387–388, 2011.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will summarize the information for each dataset, ensuring to include the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that can be used for further processing or review.
