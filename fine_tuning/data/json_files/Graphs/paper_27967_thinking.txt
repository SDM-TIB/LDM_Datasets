To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Combinatorial Optimization with Physics-Inspired Graph Neural Networks" by Martin J. A. Schuetz et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for experiments. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the research, which might include references to datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **experiments**. In this paper, I will specifically check sections that discuss the methodology or experiments, as these sections typically detail the datasets used. I will pay attention to any tables or figures that might summarize the datasets.

In the **experiments section**, the authors may describe the datasets used for their numerical experiments. I will look for specific names of datasets, their characteristics, and any relevant details such as the number of instances, types of problems they address, and how they were utilized in the study.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial as it provides the necessary context and source for the datasets, allowing others to locate them easily.

For example, if the paper mentions datasets like "Gset" or "random d-regular graphs," I will look for their citations in the references. If the datasets are publicly available, I will also note any URLs or repositories provided by the authors.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset entry includes:
1. The name of the dataset.
2. A brief description of the dataset.
3. The full citation for the dataset as found in the references.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets used in the research paper, complete with proper citations for each one.
