To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Exploiting Edge Features in Graph Neural Networks" by Liyu Gong and Qiang Cheng, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions and may mention datasets used for experiments. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss their new framework and its application to various tasks, indicating that they will use datasets for evaluation. However, I need to look for specific dataset names and details.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experimental Results)**, where the authors describe their experiments. Here, they mention using several datasets for benchmarking their proposed models. Specifically, they refer to three citation network datasets: **Cora**, **Citeseer**, and **Pubmed**. The paper provides some statistics about these datasets, which is crucial for understanding their characteristics.

The authors also mention using three molecular datasets: **Tox21**, **Lipophilicity**, and **Freesolv**. I will take note of the details provided for each dataset, including the number of samples and the type of tasks they are used for (e.g., classification or regression).

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is essential for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For the citation network datasets, I will look for the following citations:

1. **Cora Dataset**:
   > Sen, P., Namata, G., Bilgic, M., Getoor, L., Gallagher, B., & Eliassi-Rad, T. (2008). Collective Classification in Network Data. AI Magazine, 29(3), 93-106.

2. **Citeseer Dataset**:
   > Sen, P., Namata, G., Bilgic, M., Getoor, L., Gallagher, B., & Eliassi-Rad, T. (2008). Collective Classification in Network Data. AI Magazine, 29(3), 93-106.

3. **Pubmed Dataset**:
   > Namata, G., London, B., Getoor, L., & Huang, B. (2012). Query-driven Active Surveying for Collective Classification. In Workshop on Mining and Learning with Graphs.

For the molecular datasets, I will find the following citations:

1. **Tox21 Dataset**:
   > Wu, Z., Ramsundar, B., Feinberg, E. N., Gomes, J., Geniesse, A., Pappu, A. S., Leswing, K., & Pande, V. (2018). MoleculeNet: A Benchmark for Molecular Machine Learning. Chemical Science, 9(2), 513-530.

2. **Lipophilicity Dataset**:
   > Wu, Z., Ramsundar, B., Feinberg, E. N., Gomes, J., Geniesse, A., Pappu, A. S., Leswing, K., & Pande, V. (2018). MoleculeNet: A Benchmark for Molecular Machine Learning. Chemical Science, 9(2), 513-530.

3. **Freesolv Dataset**:
   > Wu, Z., Ramsundar, B., Feinberg, E. N., Gomes, J., Geniesse, A., Pappu, A. S., Leswing, K., & Pande, V. (2018). MoleculeNet: A Benchmark for Molecular Machine Learning. Chemical Science, 9(2), 513-530.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
