To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Unbiased Filtering Of Accidental Clicks in Verizon Media Native Advertising" by Yohay Kaplan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a high-level overview of the research, and while it discusses the problem of accidental clicks, it does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper.

Next, I will examine **section 4 (Click Dwell-Time Analysis)** and **section 7 (Performance Evaluation)**, as these sections often contain details about the datasets used for analysis and evaluation. In section 4, the authors mention collecting click dwell-time data for a period of one week, but they do not specify a dataset name. Instead, they describe the characteristics of the data collected, such as the percentage of accidental clicks based on dwell-time thresholds.

In section 7, the authors discuss the performance evaluation of their models but again do not provide specific dataset names. They mention that the data cannot be published due to commercial confidentiality, which indicates that the datasets used for their experiments are proprietary and not publicly available.

Since the paper does not provide specific dataset names or citations, I will note that while the authors refer to their data collection and analysis methods, they do not cite any external datasets or provide full citations for any datasets used in their experiments.

Finally, I will compile my findings. Since no specific datasets were identified with full citations, I will summarize that the paper relies on proprietary data collected from Verizon Media's advertising platform, and no external datasets were referenced.

In conclusion, I will document that while the paper discusses data collection and analysis methods, it does not provide explicit dataset names or citations, which is crucial for reproducibility and further research.
