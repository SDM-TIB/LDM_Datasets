To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-Channel Graph Convolutional Networks" by Kaixiong Zhou et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract and introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction typically outlines the context and significance of the work. In this case, the introduction mentions that the authors evaluate their method on several graph classification benchmarks, which suggests that datasets will be discussed.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets**. In this paper, the authors have a section titled **4.1 Experiment Settings**, which includes a subsection **4.1.1 Datasets**. This is likely where the datasets used in their experiments are detailed.

In this subsection, the authors list **seven graph classification benchmarks** they used, specifically mentioning:

1. **PTC**: A bioinformatics dataset.
2. **D&D**: Another bioinformatics dataset.
3. **PROTEINS**: A dataset used for protein function prediction.
4. **COLLAB**: A social network dataset.
5. **IMDB-B**: A binary classification dataset from the IMDB.
6. **IMDB-M**: A multi-class classification dataset from the IMDB.
7. **RDT-M12K**: A dataset for multi-class classification.

I will also check the **appendices** for any additional details about the datasets, such as statistics or characteristics, which can provide context for their use in the experiments.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned. The citations can often be found in the references section of the paper. For the datasets listed, I will look for the original papers or sources that describe these datasets:

- **PTC**: 
  > Pinar Yanardag and S. V. N. Vishwanathan. *A structural smoothing framework for robust graph comparison*. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 2015.

- **D&D**: 
  > Karsten M Borgwardt, Cheng Soon Ong, Stefan Schönauer, SVN Vishwanathan, Alex J Smola, and Hans-Peter Kriegel. *Protein function prediction via graph kernels*. Bioinformatics, 21(suppl 1):i47–i56, 2005.

- **PROTEINS**: 
  > Aasa Feragen, Niklas Kasenburg, Jens Petersen, Marleen de Bruijne, and Karsten M. Borgwardt. *Scalable kernels for graphs with continuous attributes*. In NeurIPS, 2013.

  > Muhan Zhang, Zhicheng Cui, Marion Neumann, and Yixin Chen. *An end-to-end deep learning architecture for graph classification*. In Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence, 2018.

- **IMDB-M**: 
  > Muhan Zhang, Zhicheng Cui, Marion Neumann, and Yixin Chen. *An end-to-end deep learning architecture for graph classification*. In Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence, 2018.

- **RDT-M12K**: 
  > Paul D Dobson and Andrew Doig. *Distinguishing enzyme structures from non-enzymes without alignments*. Journal of Molecular Biology, 330:771–783, 2003.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
