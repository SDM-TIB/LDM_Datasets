To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Close Look at Few-shot Real Image Super-resolution from the Distortion Relation Perspective" by Xin Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors are addressing the challenge of few-shot real-world image super-resolution, which suggests that they may reference specific datasets used for training and evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors discuss the limitations of existing datasets for image restoration. They mention several datasets, including **DIV2K** and **RealSR**, which are likely to be important for their experiments.

In the **experiments section**, specifically section IV-A, the authors detail the datasets used. They mention:

1. **DIV2K Dataset**: This dataset is used as the source of clean images for generating distorted images. It contains 800 clean images that are utilized to create various auxiliary datasets with different distortions.

2. **RealSR Dataset**: This dataset serves as the target dataset for the few-shot real-world image super-resolution task. The authors randomly select 30 clean-distorted image pairs from this dataset for training and evaluation.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **DIV2K Dataset**, the citation is:
  > E. Agustsson and R. Timofte. *NTIRE 2017 Challenge on Single Image Super-Resolution: Dataset and Study*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops, 2017, pp. 126–135.

- For **RealSR Dataset**, the citation is:
  > J. Cai, H. Zeng, H. Yong, Z. Cao, and L. Zhang. *Toward Real-World Single Image Super-Resolution: A New Benchmark and a New Model*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision, 2019, pp. 3086–3095.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation, ready for structured output or further processing.
