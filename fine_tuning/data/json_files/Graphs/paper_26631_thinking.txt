To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Exploiting Visual Semantic Reasoning for Video-Text Retrieval" by Zerun Feng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments on two public benchmark datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed present in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this case, I find that in **section 4.1 (Datasets and Evaluation Metric)**, the authors explicitly mention two datasets:

1. **MSR-VTT Dataset**: This dataset consists of 10,000 video clips, each paired with 20 sentence captions. It is noted as one of the largest datasets for video-text pairs.

2. **MSVD Dataset**: This dataset contains 1,970 video clips, each with around 40 multilingual sentence captions. The authors specify that they only consider the English captions and randomly select five captions from each video.

To confirm the details and obtain the full citations for these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **MSR-VTT Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Jun Xu, Tao Mei, Ting Yao, and Yong Rui. *MSR-VTT: A Large Video Description Dataset for Bridging Video and Language*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 5288–5296, 2016.

- For the **MSVD Dataset**, the citation is:
  > David L. Chen and William B. Dolan. *Collecting Highly Parallel Data for Paraphrase Evaluation*. In Proceedings of the 49th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies - Volume 1, pages 190–200, 2011.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their full citations, I will summarize the findings in a structured manner, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its citation. This will facilitate easy reference and further processing.
