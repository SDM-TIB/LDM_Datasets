To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards More Suitable Personalization in Federated Learning via Decentralized Partial Model Training" by Yifan Shi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions experiments conducted on several real-world data with various data partition settings, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 5), where the authors describe their experimental setup. Here, they explicitly mention using the **CIFAR-10**, **CIFAR-100**, and **Tiny-ImageNet** datasets. I will take note of the details provided about these datasets, including their characteristics and how they were used in the experiments.

1. **CIFAR-10**: This dataset consists of 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images across 10 classes. The authors mention that they used it in both Dirichlet and Pathological distribution settings.

2. **CIFAR-100**: Similar to CIFAR-10, this dataset contains 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images, but it has 100 classes. The authors also used this dataset in their experiments under different data partition settings.

3. **Tiny-ImageNet**: This dataset includes 100,000 training images and 10,000 test images across 200 classes. The authors conducted experiments on this dataset as well, comparing their methods against various baselines.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations of the datasets. However, since CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 are well-known datasets, I can provide their standard citations:

- **CIFAR-10**:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton, et al. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009.

- **CIFAR-100**:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton, et al. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009.

- **Tiny-ImageNet** does not have a formal citation in the same way as CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, but it is commonly referenced in the context of the CS231N course at Stanford.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations into a structured format for further use. This will ensure that I have accurately documented the datasets used in the research paper along with their proper citations.
