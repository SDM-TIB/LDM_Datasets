The adversary, a drug smuggler, is pursued by a team of heterogeneous tracker agents comprising airplanes and marine vessels. Airplanes have a larger search radius and speed than marine vessels, but only the vessels can capture the smuggler. Smugglers must first reach rendezvous points before heading to the hideouts, representing drug handoffs at sea.",
