To extract datasets from the research paper titled "About Explicit Variance Minimization: Training Neural Networks for Medical Imaging With Limited Data Annotations" by Dmitrii Shubin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors validated their method on three medical imaging datasets, which indicates that specific datasets will be discussed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention three datasets:

1. **ACDC Dataset**: This dataset is used for semantic segmentation and includes 100 volumetric images of MRI scans with expert annotations for three structures: left ventricle, myocardium, and right ventricle.

2. **APTOS 2019 Dataset**: This dataset consists of 3662 fundus photography images used for ordinary regression of diabetic retinopathy progression, categorized into five conditions: healthy, mild, moderate, severe, and proliferative.

3. **PatchCamelyon (PCam) Dataset**: This dataset contains 220,025 low-resolution histopathologic scans of lymph node sections, which are used for classifying healthy and metastatic tissues.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For the **ACDC Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Automated cardiac diagnosis challenge (ACDC). URL: https://www.creatis.insa-lyon.fr/Challenge/.

- For the **APTOS 2019 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > APTOS 2019 Blindness Detection. URL: https://www.kaggle.com/c/aptos2019-blindness-detection/overview/aptos-2019.

- For the **PatchCamelyon Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Babak Ehteshami Bejnordi et al. “Diagnostic Assessment of Deep Learning Algorithms for Detection of Lymph Node Metastases in Women With Breast Cancer”. In: JAMA 318 (2017), pp. 2199–2210.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or analysis. This process ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets along with their full citations, which is crucial for proper referencing in any subsequent work.
