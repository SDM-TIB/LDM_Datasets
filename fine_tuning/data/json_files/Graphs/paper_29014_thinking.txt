To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Self-Supervised Representation Learning via Latent Graph Prediction" by Yaochen Xie et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on various tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically **section 4**, where the authors discuss the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they mention that they conduct experiments on both node-level and graph-level self-supervised representation learning tasks with datasets used in two recent state-of-the-art methods for SSL.

In **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, the authors provide a detailed list of datasets used for graph-level tasks, including:

1. **NCI1**: A dataset for graph classification tasks.
2. **PROTEINS**: Another graph classification dataset.
3. **DD**: A dataset for graph classification.
4. **MUTAG**: A dataset for graph classification.
5. **COLLAB**: A dataset for graph classification.
6. **RDT-B**: A dataset for graph classification.
7. **RDT-M5K**: A dataset for graph classification.
8. **IMDB-B**: A dataset for graph classification.

For node-level tasks, the authors mention:

1. **Amazon Computers**: A dataset from the Amazon Co-purchase Graph.
2. **Amazon Photos**: Another dataset from the Amazon Co-purchase Graph.
3. **Coauthor CS**: A dataset from the Microsoft Academic Graph.
4. **Coauthor Physics**: Another dataset from the Microsoft Academic Graph.
5. **PPI**: A dataset for node-level classification.
6. **Reddit**: A dataset for node-level classification.
7. **Flickr**: A dataset for node-level classification.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations may not always be explicitly listed as datasets, but I will look for the original papers or sources that describe these datasets.

For example, I will find the following citations:

- For **NCI1**, the citation is:
  > Wale, N., & Karypis, G. (2006). Comparison of descriptor spaces for chemical compound retrieval and classification. In *Sixth International Conference on Data Mining* (pp. 678–689).

- For **PROTEINS**, the citation is:

- For **DD**, the citation is:
  > Dobson, P. D., & Doig, A. J. (2003). Distinguishing enzyme structures from non-enzymes without alignments. *Journal of Molecular Biology*, 330(4), 771–783.

- For **MUTAG**, the citation is:
  > Debnath, A. K., Lopez de Compadre, R. L., Debnath, G., Shusterman, A. J., & Hansch, C. (1991).

- For **COLLAB**, the citation is:
  > Sen, P., Namata, G., Bilgic, M., Getoor, L., Galligher, B., & Eliassi-Rad, T. (2008). Collective classification in network data. *AI Magazine*, 29(3), 93–93.

- For **PPI**, the citation is:
  > Zitnik, M., & Leskovec, J. (2017). Predicting multicellular function through multi-layer tissue networks. *Bioinformatics*, 33(14), i190–i198.

After gathering the dataset names and their corresponding citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly presents each dataset along with its full citation.

This systematic approach ensures that I accurately extract and document the datasets referenced in the paper, providing a comprehensive overview of the data used in the research.
