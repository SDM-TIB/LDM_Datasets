To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Unsupervised Deraining: Where Asymmetric Contrastive Learning Meets Self-similarity" by Yi Chang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and related work sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors collected a **large-scale real dataset under various rainy weathers**, which suggests that a new dataset is introduced.

Next, I will focus on the **section 3 (Field Collection Real Rain Dataset)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset they collected. Here, they describe the dataset as **Field Collection Real Rain (FCRealRain)**, which contains high-resolution rainy images collected under different weather conditions. They mention that this dataset includes annotations for various traffic elements, which is crucial for downstream tasks.

In this section, the authors also compare their dataset with existing datasets, highlighting its advantages, such as higher resolution and better quality. They provide specific details about the number of images (4000 high-resolution images) and the types of annotations included (bounding box annotations for six categories: people, cars, buses, motorcycles, traffic lights, and traffic signs).

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the FCRealRain dataset. However, since this dataset is newly introduced in the paper, it may not have a separate citation. Instead, I will note that the dataset is part of the paper itself.

The relevant dataset information I have gathered is as follows:

1. **Field Collection Real Rain (FCRealRain)**: A large-scale dataset containing 4000 high-resolution rainy images collected in various weather conditions, with annotations for traffic elements.

Since the dataset is newly introduced and does not have a separate citation, I will reference it as part of the paper's contribution.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format for clarity and future reference. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the dataset details and their significance as presented in the research paper.
