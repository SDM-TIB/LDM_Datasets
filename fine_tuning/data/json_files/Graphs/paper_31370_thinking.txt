To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Semantic-Preserving Augmentation for Robust Image-Text Retrieval" by Sunwoo Kim et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted extensive experiments using benchmark datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Image-Text Retrieval Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they state that they evaluate the performance of their method using two benchmark datasets: **MSCOCO-1K** and **Flickr30K**.

In this section, the authors provide descriptions of each dataset:

1. **MSCOCO-1K**: This dataset contains 123,287 images, with each image paired with 5 sentences. The dataset is split into 113,287 images for training, 5,000 images for validation, and 5,000 images for testing.

2. **Flickr30K**: This dataset consists of 31,700 images, each paired with 5 sentences. The authors follow a specific data split, using 1,000 images for validation and testing, with the remainder for training.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper:

- For **MSCOCO-1K**, the citation is:
  > Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, Serge Belongie, et al. *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. In European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), 2014.

- For **Flickr30K**, the citation is:
  > Young, P., Lai, A., Hodosh, M., & Hockenmaier, J. (2014). *From image descriptions to visual denotations: New similarity metrics for semantic inference over event descriptions*. Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics, 2, 67-78.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the necessary details for each dataset, including their full citations.
