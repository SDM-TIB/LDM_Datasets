To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning to Transfer Graph Embeddings for Inductive Graph based Recommendation" by Le Wu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract mentions a "real-world dataset" related to personalized video highlight recommendation, which indicates that a dataset is indeed used in the study.

Next, I will look into **section 2 (Dataset Description)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset they utilized. Here, they describe the dataset based on the Gifs.com platform, which allows users to select video highlight parts to create GIFs. The dataset includes:

1. **Gifs.com Dataset**: This dataset contains records of user interactions with videos, specifically focusing on user-selected highlight segments. The authors mention that the dataset includes approximately 14,000 users, 119,938 videos, and 225,015 annotations.

I will also note the preprocessing steps and the final statistics provided in **Table 1**, which summarizes the dataset's characteristics, including the number of users, segments, and records.

To ensure I have the correct citation for the dataset, I will check the **References section** of the paper. The authors reference the dataset as being introduced by Molino et al. (2018), which is crucial for proper citation. The full citation for the dataset is:

- Molino, A., & Gygli, M. (2018). *PHD-GIFs: Personalized Highlight Detection for Automatic GIF Creation*. In Proceedings of the ACM International Conference on Multimedia (MM), 600â€“608.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and future reference.

In summary, the steps I took to extract the dataset information included:
1. Reading the abstract and introduction for initial mentions of datasets.
2. Analyzing the dataset description section for detailed information.
3. Confirming the dataset citation from the references.

This thorough approach ensures that I accurately capture all necessary details regarding the dataset used in the research paper.
