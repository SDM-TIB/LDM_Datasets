To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Edge Dithering for Robust Adaptive Graph Convolutional Networks" by Vassilis N. Ioannidis and Georgios B. Giannakis, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the robustness of graph convolutional networks (GCNs) and mentions experiments with protein interaction networks, which suggests that datasets related to protein interactions may be involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors provide details about the datasets used. In this section, they mention three specific datasets related to protein-to-protein interactions:

1. **Generic Cells Dataset**: This dataset contains 4,487 nodes and 502 features.
2. **Brain Cells Dataset**: This dataset consists of 2,702 nodes and 81 features.
3. **Circulation Cells Dataset**: This dataset has 3,385 nodes and 62 features.

I will also check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. However, the paper does not provide specific citations for the datasets used in the experiments, which is common in some research papers when the datasets are well-known or publicly available.

Since the datasets are described in terms of their characteristics (nodes and features), I will note down these details along with the dataset names. The absence of formal citations means I will have to acknowledge that these datasets are likely derived from established sources in the field of protein interaction networks, but I will not be able to provide specific citations.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset names and their respective characteristics, while noting the lack of formal citations.

In summary, the steps I will take are:
1. Read the abstract and introduction for initial mentions of datasets.
2. Focus on the experiments section for detailed descriptions of datasets.
3. Note the characteristics of each dataset.
4. Acknowledge the lack of formal citations for these datasets.

This approach will ensure that I accurately capture the relevant dataset information from the paper.
