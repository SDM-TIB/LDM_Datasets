To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Unsupervised Anomaly Detection for Auditing Data and Impact of Categorical Encodings" by Ajay Chawda et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the datasets discussed. The abstract mentions the creation of a **Vehicle Claims dataset**, which is a key dataset for the study. This indicates that I should look for more details about this dataset in the subsequent sections.

Next, I will focus on the **Dataset section** (Section 2) where the authors provide a summary of the datasets used in their work. Here, I will find specific details about the **Vehicle Claims dataset** and any other datasets mentioned. The paper lists the **Vehicle Claims dataset** as having 268,255 rows and discusses its characteristics, such as the number of categorical features and the anomaly ratio.

In addition to the Vehicle Claims dataset, the authors also reference other datasets for comparison, including:

1. **Car Insurance Dataset**: Sourced from Kaggle, it contains 1,000 rows and 16 features, with a 25% anomaly ratio.
2. **Vehicle Insurance Dataset**: Sourced from Oracle, it contains 15,420 rows and 30 features, with a 6% anomaly ratio.
3. **Credit Card Dataset**: Sourced from MLG-ULB, it contains 284,807 rows and 34 features, with a 0.001 anomaly ratio.
4. **KDD Dataset**: Contains 494,021 rows and 279 features, with a 0.2 anomaly ratio.
5. **Arrhythmia Dataset**: Sourced from UCI, it contains 452 rows and 13 features, with a 0.26 anomaly ratio.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper documentation. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- **Vehicle Claims Dataset**: This dataset is created by the authors and does not have a separate citation, but it is described in detail in the paper.
- **Car Insurance Dataset**: 
  > Kaggle. Car insurance data. Available at: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/buntyshah/auto-insurance-claims-data, 2018.
  
- **Vehicle Insurance Dataset**: 
  > Oracle. Vehicle insurance data. Available at: https://github.com/AnalyticsandDataOracleUserCommunity/MachineLearning, 2017.
  
- **Credit Card Dataset**: 
  > MLG-ULB. Credit card. Available at: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud, 2008.
  
- **KDD Dataset**: 
  > KDD. KDD Cup 1999 Data. Available at: http://kdd.ics.uci.edu/databases/kddcup99/kddcup99.html, 1999.
  
- **Arrhythmia Dataset**: 
  > Blake, C., Keogh, E., & Merz, C. UCI repository of machine learning databases, 1998.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
