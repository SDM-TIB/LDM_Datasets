To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Floor-Plan-aided Indoor Localization: Zero-Shot Learning Framework, Data Sets, and Prototype" by Haiyao Yu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to gather initial insights about the datasets. The abstract mentions the development of a synthetic data generator and the collection of real-world data samples, indicating that there are datasets involved.

Next, I will focus on **section VI (WiFi Platform and Data Sets)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets collected in different environments. Here, they mention three specific scenarios: **Office, Laboratory, and Shopping Mall**. Each scenario has its own dataset consisting of RTT distances, RSS values, and floor-plan images.

1. **Office Dataset**: The authors describe the office environment as a 60 × 20 m² rectangular area where they collected data samples. The dataset includes RTT distance, RSS, and the corresponding floor-plan image. They also mention that the dataset is available at a specific URL.

2. **Laboratory Dataset**: This dataset is collected in a Mechanical Engineering Laboratory, which covers a 25 × 9 m² area. Similar to the office dataset, it includes RTT distances, RSS values, and floor-plan images.

3. **Shopping Mall Dataset**: The dataset from the shopping mall is collected in a hallway outside various shops. It also consists of RTT distances, RSS values, and floor-plan images.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The authors provide a link to the dataset repository, which is crucial for proper citation.

The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- **Office Dataset**: 
  > Available at: https://github.com/haiyaoyu/RTT-Indoor-localization-data-set

- **Laboratory Dataset**: 
  > Available at: https://github.com/haiyaoyu/RTT-Indoor-localization-data-set

- **Shopping Mall Dataset**: 
  > Available at: https://github.com/haiyaoyu/RTT-Indoor-localization-data-set

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations as required. Each dataset will be described with its respective details, including the environment, data types, and the availability link.

Finally, I will prepare the structured output for these datasets, ready for review or further processing.
