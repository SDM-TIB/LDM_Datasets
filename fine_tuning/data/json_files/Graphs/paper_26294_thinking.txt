To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Hyperbolic Graph Convolutional Neural Networks" by Ines Chami et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their method on various open graph datasets, which indicates that datasets will be discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments** section. In this paper, the authors provide a detailed description of the datasets used in their experiments in **section 5.1 (Experimental setup)**. Here, they list several datasets along with their characteristics.

The datasets mentioned are:

1. **CORA**: A citation network dataset containing 2,708 machine learning papers, with 5,429 edges and 7 classes.
2. **PUBMED**: Another citation network dataset with 19,717 publications in medicine, having 88,651 edges and 3 classes.
3. **HUMAN PPI**: A dataset of human protein-protein interactions with 17,598 nodes and 54,429 edges.
4. **AIRPORT**: A dataset representing airports and airline routes, consisting of 3,188 nodes and 18,631 edges.
5. **DISEASE**: A dataset simulating disease propagation with 1,044 nodes and 1,433 edges.
6. **DISEASE-M**: A variant of the DISEASE dataset with 43,193 nodes and 43,102 edges.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The paper cites the following sources for the datasets:

- For **CORA**, the citation is:
  > Prithviraj Sen, Galileo Namata, Mustafa Bilgic, Lise Getoor, Brian Galligher, and Tina Eliassi-Rad. *Collective classification in network data*. AI magazine, 2008.

- For **PUBMED**, the citation is:
  > Galileo Namata, Ben London, Lise Getoor, Bert Huang, and UMD EDU. *Query-driven active surveying for collective classification*. 2012.

- For **HUMAN PPI**, the citation is:
  > Damian Szklarczyk, John H Morris, Helen Cook, et al. *The string database in 2017: quality-controlled proteinâ€“protein association networks, made broadly accessible*. Nucleic acids research, 2016.

- For **AIRPORT**, the citation is:
  > OpenFlights.org. *OpenFlights Airport Database*. [Online]. Available: http://openflights.org/data.html.

- For **DISEASE** and **DISEASE-M**, the citation is:
  > Roy M Anderson and Robert M May. *Infectious diseases of humans: dynamics and control*. Oxford university press, 1992.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations to ensure clarity and completeness in the documentation process. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.
