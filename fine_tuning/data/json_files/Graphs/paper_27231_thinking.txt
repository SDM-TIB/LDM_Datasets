To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A*HAR: A New Benchmark Towards Semi-Supervised Learning for Class Imbalanced Human Activity Recognition" by Govind Narasimman et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract introduces the A*HAR benchmark, which is a clear indication that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any relevant subsections. In this paper, the dataset is discussed in **section 3 (The A*HAR Dataset)**. Here, the authors describe the A*HAR dataset in detail, including the types of activities it covers, the data collection methods, and the characteristics of the dataset, such as class imbalance.

The A*HAR dataset is explicitly mentioned as containing 24 activities, which include both high-intensity and low-intensity exercises, as well as daily activities. The authors also provide statistics about the dataset, such as the number of activities and the class imbalance ratio.

I will also check the **experiments section** to confirm that the A*HAR dataset was used in the experiments, which it is, as the authors evaluate their semi-supervised learning methods on this dataset.

Finally, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citation for the A*HAR dataset. Since the dataset is newly introduced in this paper, the citation will be the paper itself.

The full citation for the A*HAR dataset is:
> Govind Narasimman, Kangkang Lu, Arun Raja, Chuan Sheng Foo, Mohamed Sabry Aly, Jie Lin, and Vijay Chandrasekhar. *A*HAR: A New Benchmark Towards Semi-Supervised Learning for Class Imbalanced Human Activity Recognition*. In Proceedings of the [Conference Name], [Year].

Now, I will compile the information about the A*HAR dataset, including its description and citation, into the required format for further processing.
