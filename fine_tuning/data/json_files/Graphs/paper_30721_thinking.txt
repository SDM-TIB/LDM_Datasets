To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Traceable and Authenticable Image Tagging for Fake News Detection" by Ruohan Meng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments on diverse datasets, which indicates that there are specific datasets used in their research. I will look for any dataset names or references in these sections.

Next, I will review the **experimental results** section, specifically **section 4.1 (Experimental Setups)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for training and evaluation. Here, they mention the following datasets:

1. **DIV2K Dataset**: This dataset is used for training the proposed approach and consists of 800 high-resolution images. The authors also mention that they use the DIV2K test dataset, which includes 100 high-resolution images.

2. **COCO 2017 Dataset**: This dataset is used for evaluating the generalization of the proposed approach. It is a well-known dataset in the computer vision community.

3. **Weibo Dataset**: The authors selected 1,000 images from this dataset for testing their method.

4. **NewsStories Dataset**: Similar to the Weibo dataset, 1,000 images were selected from this dataset for evaluation.

5. **Flickr8k Dataset**: This dataset is also used, with 1,000 images selected for testing.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for each of these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The citations I will look for are:

- For **DIV2K Dataset**:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, facilitating further exploration and validation of the findings presented by the authors.
