To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Graph Contrastive Learning with Implicit Augmentations" by Huidong Liang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions "experimental results on both graph-level and node-level tasks," which suggests that datasets are involved, but I need to find specific names.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they provide a table (Table 1) summarizing the dataset statistics and hyper-parameter settings for graph-level tasks. The datasets listed include:

1. **MUTAG**: A dataset of molecular graphs used for classification tasks.
2. **NCI1**: Another molecular dataset used for binary classification.
3. **PROTEINS**: A dataset of protein structures for binary classification.
4. **COLLAB**: A social network dataset used for multi-class classification.
5. **IMDB-B**: A dataset of movie networks for binary classification.
6. **IMDB-M**: A dataset of movie networks for multi-class classification.

I will also check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. The authors typically cite the original sources of the datasets they used. 

For example, the citations for the datasets might look like this:

- **MUTAG**:

- **IMDB-B**:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
