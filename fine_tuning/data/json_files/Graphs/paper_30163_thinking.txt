To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ARMA Cell: A Modular and Effective Approach for Neural Autoregressive Modeling" by Philipp Schiele et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for validation or testing. In the introduction, the authors often discuss the context of their work, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Numerical experiments)**, as this section typically contains detailed information about the datasets used in the experiments. Here, the authors mention several datasets, including:

1. **M4 Dataset**: This dataset is described as containing 414 time series of hourly data, used in the Makridakis Competitions. The authors note that they take a subset of ten time series for their experiments.

2. **Traffic Dataset**: This dataset consists of car lane occupancy rates from freeways in the San Francisco Bay Area, with a total of 963 time series. The authors specify that they use the first ten time series for their analysis.

3. **Electricity Dataset**: This dataset includes electricity consumption time series from 370 customers, aggregated to hourly consumption for the experiments.

4. **Exchange Dataset**: The authors mention that this dataset contains exchange rates from eight countries, which they use to calculate returns for stationary time series.

5. **Moving MNIST Dataset**: This dataset consists of 10,000 video sequences of moving digits, which the authors use for next-frame prediction tasks.

6. **Taxi NYC and Bike NYC Datasets**: These datasets consist of trip records from New York City, used for crowd flow prediction.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

Now that I have gathered the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
