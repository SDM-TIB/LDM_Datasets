To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Self-Contrastive Weakly Supervised Learning Framework for Prognostic Prediction Using Whole Slide Images" by Saul Fuster et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study involves a novel framework for prognostic prediction using whole slide images (WSI), which suggests that datasets related to WSI are likely included.

Next, I will focus on the **dataset section** of the paper, which is crucial for identifying specific datasets used in the study. In this section, the authors describe two distinct cohorts from which they gathered data for their analysis:

1. **SEMC Dataset**: This dataset consists of whole slide images (WSI) from patients with high-risk non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (HR-NMIBC) and is used for predicting BCG treatment response. The dataset includes 453 patients and 503 WSIs, with annotations for tissue types and clinical variables.

2. **SSUH Dataset**: This dataset includes WSI from 300 different NMIBC patients and is used for recurrence prediction. It contains weak labels regarding recurrence outcomes but no specific region of interest (ROI) annotations.

I will also check the **results and discussion sections** to confirm that these datasets were indeed utilized for the experiments and to gather any additional context or details about their use.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **references section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The citations are essential for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For the **SEMC Dataset**, the citation is:
> Fuster S, Eftestøl T, Engan K. *Nested multiple instance learning with attention mechanisms*. In: 2022 21st IEEE International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications (ICMLA). IEEE; 2022. p. 220–225.

For the **SSUH Dataset**, the citation is:
> Fuster S, Khoraminia F, Eftestøl T, Zuiverloon T, Engan K. *Active Learning Based Domain Adaptation for Tissue Segmentation of Histopathological Images*. In: 2023 31st European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO). IEEE; 2023. p. 1045–1049.

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, I will compile this into a structured format that highlights each dataset's name, description, and citation, ensuring that I adhere to the required format for clarity and completeness.
