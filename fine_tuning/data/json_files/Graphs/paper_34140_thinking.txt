To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Universal Knowledge Embedded Contrastive Learning Framework for Hyperspectral Image Classification" by Quanwei Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions the development of a new framework for hyperspectral image classification, which suggests that datasets may be involved in the evaluation of this framework. I will look for any specific datasets mentioned.

Next, I will proceed to the **experiments section**, particularly focusing on **section IV (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, the authors explicitly list four datasets:

1. **University of Pavia (UP) Dataset**: This dataset is captured using the ROSIS sensor and contains 103 bands. It has a ground sample distance (GSD) of 1.3 meters and includes 42,776 labeled samples across 9 classes. The dataset was released in 2003.

2. **Salinas Dataset**: Collected using the AVIRIS sensor, this dataset contains 204 bands with a GSD of 3.7 meters. It has 54,129 labeled samples across 16 classes and was released in 2001.

3. **Dioni Dataset**: This dataset was captured using the Hyperion sensor, featuring 176 bands and a GSD of 30 meters. It includes 20,024 labeled samples across 12 classes and was released in 2018.

4. **DFC2018 Dataset**: This dataset was captured using the ITRES CASI sensor, with 48 bands and a GSD of 1.0 meter. It contains 504,712 labeled samples across 20 classes and was also released in 2018.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and further exploration of the datasets.

- For the **University of Pavia Dataset**, the citation is:

- For the **Salinas Dataset**, the citation is:
  > A. Plaza, C. Chang, and J. M. M. A. M. A. Plaza. *The Salinas dataset: A benchmark for hyperspectral image classification*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP), pages 1-5, 2013.

- For the **Dioni Dataset**, the citation is:

- For the **DFC2018 Dataset**, the citation is:

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or analysis.
