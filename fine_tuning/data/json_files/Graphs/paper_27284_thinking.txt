To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Graph Neural Networks to Predict Customer Satisfaction Following Interactions with a Corporate Call Center" by Teja Kanchinadam et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on predicting customer satisfaction, which suggests that datasets related to customer interactions may be involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, specifically **subsection 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention two datasets:

1. **Call Transcripts**: This dataset consists of 31,000 calls, with 20% used for validation and around 8,000 for testing. The authors emphasize the importance of an on-date split for the testing set to ensure the model generalizes well to evolving language use.

2. **Amazon Product Reviews**: This dataset is based on a publicly available collection of reviews from the Electronics category on Amazon, comprising approximately 150,000 reviews. Each review is rated on a scale from 1 to 5, indicating customer satisfaction.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For the **Call Transcripts dataset**, since it is a proprietary dataset curated by the authors, there may not be a formal citation. However, I can note that it is based on internal company data.

For the **Amazon Product Reviews dataset**, I will look for the relevant references in the paper. The authors cite two papers related to the dataset:

- For the Amazon Product Reviews dataset, the citation is:
  > Ruining He and Julian McAuley. *Ups and downs: Modeling the visual evolution of fashion trends with one-class collaborative filtering*. In Proceedings of the 25th international conference on world wide web, pages 507â€“517, 2016.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will summarize the findings:

1. **Call Transcripts**: A proprietary dataset of 31,000 calls, with validation and testing splits.
2. **Amazon Product Reviews**: A dataset of approximately 150,000 reviews with ratings from 1 to 5.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
