To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Uncertainty-Matching Graph Neural Networks to Defend Against Poisoning Attacks" by Uday Shankar Shanthamallu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, but I need to look for specific dataset names and details in the main body of the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Empirical Evaluation)**, where the authors discuss the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention three benchmark citation networks: **Cora**, **Citeseer**, and **Pubmed**. I will extract the relevant details about each dataset, including the number of nodes, edges, features, and classes, as summarized in **Table 1**.

The details for each dataset are as follows:

1. **Cora**: 
   - Number of Nodes: 2708
   - Number of Edges: 5278
   - Number of Features: 1433
   - Number of Classes: 7

2. **Citeseer**: 
   - Number of Nodes: 3327
   - Number of Edges: 4614
   - Number of Features: 3703
   - Number of Classes: 6

3. **Pubmed**: 
   - Number of Nodes: 19717
   - Number of Edges: 44325
   - Number of Features: 500
   - Number of Classes: 3

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The authors reference the datasets as follows:

- For **Cora**, the citation is:
  > Sen, P., Namata, G., Bilgic, M., Getoor, L., Galligher, B., & Eliassi-Rad, T. (2008). Collective classification in network data. *AI Magazine*, 29(3), 93-93.

- For **Citeseer**, the citation is the same as for Cora, as they are both benchmark datasets used in similar studies.

- For **Pubmed**, the citation is also the same as for Cora and Citeseer.

Since the datasets are commonly referenced in the literature, I will use the citation for Cora as the authoritative reference for all three datasets.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective details and citations into a structured format for further processing or review.
