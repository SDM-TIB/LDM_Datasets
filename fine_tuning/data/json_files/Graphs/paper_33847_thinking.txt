To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Minimize Control Inputs for Strong Structural Controllability Using Reinforcement Learning with Directed Graph Neural Network" by Mengbang Zou et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or data sources used for validation.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors may discuss the context of their research and any datasets they reference. If they mention specific datasets or studies that utilize datasets, I will note those down.

In the **methods section**, I will look for any detailed descriptions of the datasets used in their experiments. This section often contains information about the data collection process, the characteristics of the datasets, and how they were utilized in the experiments. 

The **results section** may also provide insights into the datasets, especially if the authors discuss the performance of their methods on specific datasets. I will pay attention to any figures or tables that might summarize the datasets or their properties.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, if the authors mention using a dataset from a previous study, I will locate that study in the references and extract the full citation. 

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for easy review or further processing, ensuring that all citations are complete and correctly formatted.
