To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Model-enhanced Contrastive Reinforcement Learning for Sequential Recommendation" by Chengpeng Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the experiments were conducted on "two real-world datasets," which indicates that datasets are indeed present. I will look for specific names or descriptions of these datasets.

Next, I will navigate to **section 4.1 (Dataset Description)**, where the authors provide detailed statistics about the datasets used in their experiments. Here, I will find the following datasets:

1. **RetailRocket Dataset**: This dataset is collected from a real-world e-commerce website, containing user behavior data such as clicks and purchases. The authors mention that there are 1,176,680 clicks and 57,269 purchases across 70,852 items.

2. **Yoochoose Dataset**: This dataset is sourced from the RecSys Challenge 2015, consisting of user-item interaction sessions. The authors state that it includes 1,110,965 clicks and 43,946 purchases across 26,702 items.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For the **RetailRocket Dataset**, the citation is:
> RetailRocket. *E-commerce Dataset*. Available at: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/retailrocket/ecommerce-dataset.

For the **Yoochoose Dataset**, the citation is:
> Yoochoose. *RecSys Challenge 2015 Dataset*. Available at: https://recsys.acm.org/recsys15/challenge/.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that highlights each dataset's name, description, and citation. This will ensure that the datasets are clearly documented and easily accessible for future reference or analysis.
