To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Road Extraction from Overhead Images with Graph Neural Networks" by Gaetan Bahl et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the datasets referenced. In the abstract, the authors mention evaluating their method on the **RoadTracer dataset**, which indicates that this dataset is significant for their research.

Next, I will look for specific sections that discuss datasets in detail. The **experiments section** is likely to provide more information about the datasets used for evaluation. In this case, the authors explicitly mention the **RoadTracer dataset** as the primary dataset for their experiments.

I will also check the **related works** and **method** sections to see if any other datasets are referenced or if there are any comparisons made with other datasets. The authors mention other datasets like **SpaceNet3** and **Massachusetts roads** in the context of their experiments, indicating that these datasets are also relevant to their work.

Now, I will compile the details of each dataset mentioned in the paper:

1. **RoadTracer Dataset**: This dataset is used for evaluating the proposed method. It consists of 35 training cities and 15 test cities, with high-resolution images and dense annotations.

2. **SpaceNet3 Dataset**: This dataset is referenced in the context of evaluating the method's performance. It is known for its use in road extraction tasks.

3. **Massachusetts Roads Dataset**: This dataset is also mentioned as part of the evaluation process, indicating its relevance in the context of road extraction.

Next, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

- For the **RoadTracer dataset**, the citation is:
  > Favyen Bastani, Songtao He, Sofiane Abbar, Mohammad Alizadeh, Hari Balakrishnan, Sanjay Chawla, Sam Madden, and David DeWitt. *Roadtracer: Automatic extraction of road networks from aerial images*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2018.

- For the **SpaceNet3 dataset**, the citation is:
  > Adam Van Etten, Dave Lindenbaum, and Todd M Bacastow. *Spacenet: A remote sensing dataset and challenge series*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1807.01232, 2018.

- For the **Massachusetts Roads dataset**, the citation is:
  > Volodymyr Mnih. *Machine learning for aerial image labeling*. University of Toronto (Canada), 2013.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will summarize the datasets and their citations clearly to ensure that they are well-documented and ready for inclusion in any structured output or further analysis.
