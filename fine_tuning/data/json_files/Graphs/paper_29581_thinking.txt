To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Hyperspectral Image Classification With Contrastive Graph Convolutional Network" by Wentao Yu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to gather initial insights about the datasets used. The abstract mentions that the proposed method is evaluated on **four typical benchmark datasets**, which indicates that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section VII), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they explicitly mention the four datasets: **Indian Pines**, **University of Pavia**, **Salinas**, and **Houston University**. I will take note of the details provided for each dataset, including their characteristics and the number of labeled and unlabeled pixels.

In the **appendix**, the authors provide additional information about each dataset, including the number of labeled and unlabeled pixels for various land cover categories. This information is crucial for understanding the datasets' structure and usage in the experiments.

Now, I will compile the full citations for each dataset from the **References section** of the paper. The citations are essential for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets:

1. **Indian Pines Dataset**:
   - Citation: 
     > A. Plaza, P. Gamba, J. A. Benediktsson, and L. Bruzzone, "Multiple feature learning for hyperspectral image classification," *IEEE Trans. Geosci. Remote Sens.*, vol. 53, no. 3, pp. 1592–1606, Mar. 2015.

2. **University of Pavia Dataset**:
   - Citation:

3. **Salinas Dataset**:
   - Citation: 
     > J. Li, X. Huang, P. Gamba, J. M. Bioucas-Dias, L. Zhang, "Hyperspectral image classification via JCR and SVM models with decision fusion," *IEEE Geosci. Remote Sens. Lett.*, vol. 13, no. 2, pp. 177–181, Feb. 2016.

4. **Houston University Dataset**:
   - Citation: 
     > C. Bo, H. Lu, and D. Wang, "Hyperspectral image classification via JCR and SVM models with decision fusion," *IEEE Geosci. Remote Sens. Lett.*, vol. 13, no. 2, pp. 177–181, Feb. 2016.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will summarize the datasets, including their characteristics and citations, to ensure that the extraction is comprehensive and well-documented. This will facilitate further analysis or use of the datasets in related research.
