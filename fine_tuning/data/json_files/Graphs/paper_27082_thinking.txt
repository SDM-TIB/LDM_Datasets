To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Hyperspectral Super-Resolution via Interpretable Block-Term Tensor Modeling" by Meng Ding et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for experiments or validation.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, which typically contains detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the study. In this paper, the authors mention that they tested their algorithms on **four different semi-real datasets** derived from the Salinas, Pavia University, Indian Pines, and Jasper Ridge datasets. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for the experiments.

I will then look for specific details about each dataset in the **experiments section**. The paper states that:

1. **Salinas Dataset**: This dataset is a subscene collected by the AVIRIS sensor over Salinas Valley, consisting of 80 × 84 × 204 pixels after removing certain bands.

2. **Pavia University Dataset**: Captured by the ROSIS sensor, this dataset has a size of 256 × 256 × 103 for the SRI and 256 × 256 × 4 for the MSI.

3. **Indian Pines Dataset**: This dataset is a subscene acquired by the AVIRIS sensor, consisting of 144 × 144 × 200 pixels.

4. **Jasper Ridge Dataset**: This dataset has a size of 100 × 100 × 198 after removing bands affected by atmospheric effects.

Next, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are essential for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. 

For the datasets mentioned, I will compile the following citations:

- **Salinas Dataset**:
  > Gualtieri, J. A., Chettri, S. R., Cromp, R. F., & Johnson, L. F. (2015). *220 band AVIRIS hyperspectral image data set: June 12, 1992 Indian Pine test site 3*. Purdue University Research Repository.

- **Pavia University Dataset**:
  > Kunkel, B., Blechinger, F., Lutz, R., Doerffer, R., van der Piepen, H., & Schroder, M. (1988). *ROSIS (reflective optics system imaging spectrometer) - A candidate instrument for polar platform missions*. In Proceedings of SPIE, vol. 868, pp. 134–142.

- **Indian Pines Dataset**:
  > Baumgardner, M. F., Biehl, L. L., & Landgrebe, D. A. (2015). *220 band AVIRIS hyperspectral image data set: June 12, 1992 Indian Pine test site 3*. Purdue University Research Repository.

- **Jasper Ridge Dataset**:

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets and their citations in a structured format for easy reference. This systematic approach ensures that I capture all relevant datasets and provide proper citations for each.
