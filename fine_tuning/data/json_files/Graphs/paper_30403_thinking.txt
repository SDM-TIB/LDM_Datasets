To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On skip connections and normalisation layers in deep optimisation" by Lachlan E. MacDonald et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for validation. In this case, the authors refer to experiments conducted on **MNIST, CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and ImageNet**, which indicates that these datasets are relevant to the study.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors describe their empirical analysis and state that they verified their predictions on the aforementioned datasets. This confirms that these datasets are indeed utilized in their experiments.

Now, I will gather detailed information about each dataset, including its characteristics and the context in which it was used. The datasets mentioned are:

1. **MNIST**: A well-known dataset of handwritten digits, commonly used for training various image processing systems.
2. **CIFAR10**: A dataset containing 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class.
3. **CIFAR100**: Similar to CIFAR10 but with 100 classes containing 600 images each.
4. **ImageNet**: A large visual database designed for use in visual object recognition software research.

Next, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **MNIST**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998.

- For **CIFAR10** and **CIFAR100**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009.

- For **ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Olga Russakovsky, Jia Deng, Hao Sheng, et al. *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 115(3):211-252, 2015.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, which can be useful for further studies or applications in the field.
