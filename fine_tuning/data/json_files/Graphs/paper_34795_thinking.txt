To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Mindâ€™s Eye: Image Recognition by EEG via Multimodal Similarity-Keeping Contrastive Learning" by Chi-Sheng Chen and Chun-Shu Wei, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the use of an extensive visual EEG dataset, which indicates that there is at least one dataset involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets and Preprocessing)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they specifically mention the **ThingsEEG dataset**, which is described as comprising extensive EEG recordings gathered through a rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) paradigm. The dataset includes responses from 10 individuals to 16,740 natural images from the THINGS database, with specific details about the training and test classes.

I will note the key details about the **ThingsEEG dataset**:
- It consists of EEG recordings from 10 individuals.
- It features 16,740 natural images from the THINGS database.
- There are 1654 training classes (each with 10 images) and 200 test classes (each with 1 image).
- EEG recordings were conducted using 64-channel EASYCAP equipment.

Now, I will look for the full citation of the **ThingsEEG dataset** in the **References section**. The relevant citation is:
> Alessandro T Gifford, Kshitij Dwivedi, Gemma Roig, and Radoslaw M Cichy. *A large and rich EEG dataset for modeling human visual object recognition*. NeuroImage, 264:119754, 2022.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets explicitly, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format.

In summary, I will create an entry for the **ThingsEEG dataset** with its details and citation, ensuring that I include the full citation as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the dataset used in the research.
