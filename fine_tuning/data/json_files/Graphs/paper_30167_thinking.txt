To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Models and Benchmarks for Representation Learning of Partially Observed Subgraphs" by Dongkwan Kim et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on three real-world datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they explicitly mention three datasets:

1. **FNTN (Fake News in Twitter Network)**: This dataset is used for the task of detecting fake news based on news propagation trees in a Twitter network. The authors provide a brief description of its structure and purpose.

2. **EM-User (Users in EndoMondo)**: This dataset is a fitness network where users are represented as subgraphs, and the task is to profile users' gender based on workout logs.

3. **HPO-Metab (Metabolic disease in Human Phenotype Ontology)**: This dataset consists of symptoms associated with metabolic diseases, where the task is to classify the disease type based on observed symptoms.

After identifying the datasets, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The citations I will extract are:

- For **FNTN**, the citation is:
  > Jooyeon Kim, Dongkwan Kim, and Alice Oh. *Homogeneity-based transmissive process to model true and false news in social networks*. In WSDM, 2019.

- For **EM-User**, the citation is:
  > Emily Alsentzer, Samuel G Finlayson, Michelle M Li, and Marinka Zitnik. *Subgraph Neural Networks*. NeurIPS, 2020.

- For **HPO-Metab**, the citation is:
  > Sebastian KÃ¶hler, Leigh Carmody, Nicole Vasilevsky, Julius O B Jacobsen, Daniel Danis, Jean-Philippe Gourdine, Michael Gargano, Nomi L Harris, Nicolas Matentzoglu, Julie A McMurry, et al. *Expansion of the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) knowledge base and resources*. Nucleic acids research, 2019.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their proper citations.
