To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Real-Time Hybrid Mapping of Populated Indoor Scenes using a Low-Cost Monocular UAV" by Stuart Golodetz et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors validate their system using the **ScanNet** and **GTA-IM** datasets, which suggests that these are important datasets for their research.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments** section. In the introduction, the authors mention that they validate their design choices through experiments on **ScanNet** and **GTA-IM**, confirming their significance. 

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide details about the datasets used:
1. **ScanNet**: Described as a large-scale 3D reconstruction dataset consisting of 1513 RGB-D sequences of unpopulated scenes. This dataset is used to compare different depth estimators and to demonstrate the effectiveness of their post-processing methods.
2. **GTA-IM**: This dataset is characterized as a large-scale indoor motion and human-scene interaction dataset, consisting of 64 synthetic RGB-D sequences with ground-truth camera poses and instance masks, as well as 3D skeleton data for the primary character in each sequence. It is used to evaluate skeleton detection and people masking approaches.

Additionally, the authors mention that they constructed a new dataset called the **Oxford Hybrid Mapping dataset**, which consists of 6 populated scenes captured using a DJI Tello drone and a Vicon Vantage system. This dataset is used to evaluate the overall performance of their hybrid mapping system.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

- For **ScanNet**, the citation is:
  > A. Dai, A. X. Chang, M. Savva, M. Halber, T. Funkhouser, and M. NieÃŸner. *ScanNet: Richly-annotated 3D Reconstructions of Indoor Scenes*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2017.

- For **GTA-IM**, the citation is:
  > Z. Cao, H. Gao, K. Mangalam, Q.-Z. Cai, M. Vo, and J. Malik. *Long-term Human Motion Prediction with Scene Context*. In Proceedings of the European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), 2020.

- For the **Oxford Hybrid Mapping dataset**, since it is a new dataset created by the authors, I will use the citation for the paper itself:
  > Stuart Golodetz, Madhu Vankadari, Andrew Markham, Aluna Everitt, Niki Trigoni, and Sangyun Shin. *Real-Time Hybrid Mapping of Populated Indoor Scenes using a Low-Cost Monocular UAV*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA), 2022.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
