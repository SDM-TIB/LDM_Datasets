To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Graph Message Passing with Cross-Location Attentions for Long-Term ILI Prediction" by Songgaojun Deng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract highlights the use of real-world epidemic-related datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention three datasets:

1. **Japan-Prefectures**: This dataset contains weekly influenza-like illness statistics from 47 prefectures in Japan, covering the period from August 2012 to March 2019.

2. **US-States**: This dataset includes influenza disease data from the CDC, detailing patient visit counts for ILI for each week and each state in the United States from 2010 to 2017, with 49 states included after removing those with missing data.

3. **US-Regions**: This dataset is derived from the ILINet portion of the US-HHS, consisting of weekly influenza activity levels for 10 HHS regions of the U.S. mainland from 2002 to 2017.

I will then verify the details of each dataset, including their sizes and the time periods they cover, as provided in the paper.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. 

For the datasets mentioned, the citations are as follows:

- **Japan-Prefectures**: The dataset is sourced from the Infectious Diseases Weekly Report (IDWR) in Japan. The citation for this dataset is not explicitly provided in the paper, so I will note that it is from the IDWR.

- **US-States**: The dataset is collected from the Center for Disease Control (CDC). The citation for this dataset is also not explicitly provided, but I will note that it is from the CDC.

- **US-Regions**: This dataset is part of the ILINet portion of the US-HHS. Similar to the others, the citation is not explicitly provided, but I will note that it is from the US-HHS.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations and any relevant details in a structured format for easy reference.

In summary, I will extract the datasets by:
1. Reading the relevant sections of the paper to identify datasets.
2. Listing the datasets along with their descriptions.
3. Finding and noting the citations for each dataset, even if they are not explicitly provided in the paper.
4. Compiling this information for clarity and future reference.
