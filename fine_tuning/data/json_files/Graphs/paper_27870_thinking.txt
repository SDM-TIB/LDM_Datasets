To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Solving Graph-based Public Good Games with Tree Search and Imitation Learning" by Victor-Alexandru Darvariu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or data collection methods.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors often discuss the context of their research and may mention datasets used for training or evaluation. I will take note of any specific datasets mentioned.

In the **methodology section**, particularly in the subsection titled "Collection of Demonstrations by Monte Carlo Tree Search," the authors describe how they collect data for their experiments. They mention a dataset of demonstrations collected during the training phase, which is crucial for understanding the data used in their experiments.

I will also examine the **experiments section** to see if the authors provide details about the datasets used for evaluation. This section often contains information about the size, characteristics, and sources of the datasets.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. This is essential for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. I will look for any papers or resources cited that describe the datasets in detail.

Based on the information gathered, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset. For example, if the authors mention a dataset called "Gtrain" used for training, I will document its characteristics and provide the citation from the references.

Finally, I will ensure that each dataset entry is clearly articulated, including its purpose, size, and any relevant details that would help others understand its significance in the context of the research.

By following these steps, I will be able to extract and document the datasets used in the paper effectively, ensuring that all necessary citations are included for future reference.
