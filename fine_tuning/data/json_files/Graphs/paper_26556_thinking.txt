To extract datasets from the research paper titled "TAGNN: Target Attentive Graph Neural Networks for Session-based Recommendation" by Feng Yu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that comprehensive experiments were conducted on real-world datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed used in the study.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for evaluation. They state that they evaluated their method using two widely-used real-world datasets: **Yoochoose** and **Diginetica**. This is a clear indication that these datasets are central to their experiments.

In this section, the authors provide additional context about the datasets, including their origins and preprocessing steps. They mention that the **Yoochoose** dataset was obtained from the RecSys 2015 contest and the **Diginetica** dataset was obtained from the CIKM 2016 contest. This information is crucial for understanding the datasets' backgrounds.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are typically formatted according to the conference or journal's guidelines, and I will ensure to capture them accurately.

For the **Yoochoose dataset**, the citation is:
> RecSys Challenge 2015. *Yoochoose Dataset*. Available at: http://2015.recsyschallenge.com/challenge.html.

For the **Diginetica dataset**, the citation is:
> CIKM Cup 2016. *Diginetica Dataset*. Available at: http://cikm2016.cs.iupui.edu/cikm-cup.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **Yoochoose**: A dataset from the RecSys 2015 challenge, used for session-based recommendation tasks.
2. **Diginetica**: A dataset from the CIKM 2016 challenge, also used for session-based recommendation tasks.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation, ready for structured output or further processing.
