To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Message Passing Perspective on Learning Dynamics of Contrastive Learning" by Yifei Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the work, which may include mentions of datasets used for experiments.

Next, I will pay close attention to the **experiments section** of the paper, as this is where authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. I will look for any specific names of datasets, descriptions of their contents, and any relevant details such as the number of samples, types of data, and the context in which they were used.

If the paper includes a **datasets section**, I will review it thoroughly, as it will likely contain detailed descriptions of each dataset. I will note down the names of the datasets, their characteristics, and any relevant statistics provided by the authors.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily. I will ensure that I capture the authors, title, publication venue, and year for each dataset.

For example, if the paper mentions the **CIFAR-10 dataset**, I would look for its citation, which typically includes:
> Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical Report, 2009.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details and that the information is presented clearly and accurately.
