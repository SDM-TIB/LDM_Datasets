To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Simple and Yet Fairly Effective Defense for Graph Neural Networks" by Sofiane Ennadir et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted empirical evaluations on various benchmark datasets, which indicates that datasets are likely discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In the provided text, the authors mention using citation networks such as **Cora**, **CiteSeer**, **PubMed**, and **PolBlogs** for their experiments. This is a clear indication that these datasets are relevant to their research.

I will then gather specific details about each dataset, including the number of features, nodes, edges, and classes, as outlined in the **datasets and implementation details** section. The paper provides a table summarizing the characteristics of the datasets used:

1. **Cora**: 
   - Features: 1433
   - Nodes: 2708
   - Edges: 5208
   - Classes: 7

2. **CiteSeer**: 
   - Features: 3703
   - Nodes: 3327
   - Edges: 4552
   - Classes: 6

3. **PubMed**: 
   - Features: 500
   - Nodes: 19717
   - Edges: 44338
   - Classes: 3

4. **PolBlogs**: 
   - Features: N/A
   - Nodes: 1222
   - Edges: 16717
   - Classes: 2

5. **OGBN-Arxiv**: 
   - Features: 128
   - Nodes: 31971
   - Edges: 71669
   - Classes: 40

Next, I will locate the full citations for these datasets in the **References section** of the paper. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- **Cora**:

Finally, I will compile the dataset information along with their citations into a structured format for further processing or review.
