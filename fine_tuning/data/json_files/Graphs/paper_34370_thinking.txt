To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Subgraph2vec: A random walk-based algorithm for embedding knowledge graphs" by Elika Bozorgi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often highlights the datasets used for evaluation. In this case, the authors mention using two datasets for their experiments: **YAGO39K** and **NELL**.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (Section V) where the authors describe the datasets in detail. Here, they provide specific information about each dataset:

1. **YAGO39K**: The authors describe it as a dataset that includes data from Wikipedia, WordNet, and GeoNames, containing 123,182 unique entities and 1,084,040 unique edges with 37 different relation types.

2. **NELL**: This dataset is built from the web via an intelligent agent and contains 49,869 unique nodes, 296,013 edges, and 827 relation types.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For **YAGO39K**, the citation is:
> Suchanek, F. M., Kasneci, G., & Weikum, G. (2007). *YAGO: A large ontology from Wikipedia and WordNet*. In Proceedings of the 16th International Conference on World Wide Web (WWW), 2007, pp. 697-706.

For **NELL**, the citation is:
> Mitchell, T. M., & others. (2015). *Never-Ending Learning*. In Proceedings of the 29th AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI), 2015, pp. 230-237.

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This structured approach will help in accurately documenting the datasets used in the research.
