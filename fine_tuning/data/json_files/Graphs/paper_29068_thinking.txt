To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Mutually Reinforced Framework for Pretrained Sentence Embeddings" by Junhan Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that extensive experiments were performed based on **three benchmark datasets**, which indicates that datasets are indeed involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors discuss the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, they explicitly list the datasets:

1. **News Dataset**: This dataset consists of Microsoft News articles released by MIND, with a total of 1,500,000 documents and an average document length of 19.51 sentences. The dataset is used for training and evaluation, with specific numbers of labeled instances provided.

2. **Web Document Dataset**: This dataset contains web documents released by the MS MARCO corpus, totaling 3,213,835 documents with an average length of 28.90 sentences. Similar to the News dataset, it includes labeled instances for training and evaluation.

3. **Web Browsing Dataset**: This dataset is collected from a commercial search platform, containing 3,000,000 documents with an average length of 43.28 sentences. It also has labeled instances for training and evaluation.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets that are referenced in the paper. However, in this case, the datasets are proprietary or specific to the authors' work and may not have external citations.

Now, I will compile the information about each dataset, ensuring to include the full citation for the paper itself, as it is essential for proper attribution.

The full citation for the paper is:
> Junhan Yang, Zheng Liu, Shitao Xiao, Jianxun Lian, Lijun Wu, Defu Lian, Guangzhong Sun, Xing Xie. *A Mutually Reinforced Framework for Pretrained Sentence Embeddings*. In Proceedings of the 2022 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), pages 1-12, 2022.

With this information, I will prepare to create structured entries for each dataset, ensuring that the citations are included as required.
