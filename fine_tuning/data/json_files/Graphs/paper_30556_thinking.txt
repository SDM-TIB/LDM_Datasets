To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Graph Fuzzy System: Concepts, Models and Algorithms" by Fuping Hu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by scanning the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. In the abstract, the authors mention that they conducted experiments on various benchmark graph classification datasets. This indicates that there are datasets to be identified.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors provide a detailed description of the datasets used in their experiments in **Section IV (Experimental Studies)**. Here, they list eight graph classification datasets along with some statistics about each dataset.

The datasets mentioned are:

1. **ENZYMES**: This dataset consists of 600 graphs, with an average of 32.63 nodes and 62.14 edges per graph, and it has 6 categories.
   - Citation: K. M. Borgwardt et al., "Protein function prediction via graph kernels," *Bioinformatics*, vol. 21, no. suppl_1, pp. i47-i56, 2005.

2. **PROTEINS**: This dataset contains 1,113 graphs, with an average of 39.06 nodes and 72.82 edges per graph, and it has 2 categories.
   - Citation: P. D. Dobson and A. J. Doig, "Distinguishing enzyme structures from non-enzymes without alignments," *Journal of Molecular Biology*, vol. 330, no. 4, pp. 771-783, 2003.

3. **PROTEINS_full**: Similar to the PROTEINS dataset, it also has 1,113 graphs, with an average of 39.06 nodes and 72.82 edges, and it has 2 categories.
   - Citation: Same as PROTEINS.

4. **BZR**: This dataset consists of 405 graphs, with an average of 35.75 nodes and 38.36 edges, and it has 2 categories.
   - Citation: J. J. Sutherland et al., "Spline-fitting with a genetic algorithm: A method for developing classification structureâ€“activity relationships," *Journal of Chemical Information and Computer Sciences*, vol. 43, no. 6, pp. 1906-1915, 2003.

5. **DHFR**: This dataset contains 467 graphs, with an average of 42.43 nodes and 44.54 edges, and it has 2 categories.
   - Citation: Same as BZR.

6. **COX2**: This dataset also has 467 graphs, with an average of 41.22 nodes and 43.45 edges, and it has 2 categories.
   - Citation: Same as BZR.

7. **Cuneiform**: This dataset consists of 267 graphs, with an average of 21.27 nodes and 44.80 edges, and it has 30 categories.
   - Citation: N. M. Kriege et al., "Recognizing cuneiform signs using graph-based methods," in *Proceedings of Machine Learning Research*, 2018, pp. 31-44.

8. **AIDS**: This dataset contains 2,000 graphs, with an average of 15.69 nodes and 16.20 edges, and it has 2 categories.
   - Citation: K. Riesen and H. Bunke, "IAM graph database repository for graph-based pattern recognition and machine learning," in *Joint IAPR International Workshops on Statistical Techniques in Pattern Recognition (SPR) and Structural and Syntactic Pattern Recognition (SSPR)*, 2008, pp. 287-297.

After identifying these datasets, I will ensure to compile the full citations accurately as they are crucial for referencing.

Finally, I will summarize the extracted datasets and their citations in a structured format for easy reference and further processing.
