To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Spatio-Temporal Pyramid Graph Convolutions for Human Action Recognition and Postural Assessment" by Behnoosh Parsa et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors tested their method on two public benchmark datasets for postural assessment, specifically mentioning **TUM** and **UW-IOM** datasets. This is a strong indication that these datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any relevant sections that discuss the datasets in detail. In the **experiments section**, the authors provide descriptions of the datasets used:

1. **UW-IOM Dataset**: This dataset is introduced in a previous work by the authors and is designed to capture activities common in warehouses. It consists of videos recorded using a Kinect sensor, with a hierarchical labeling system that includes object types, human motions, manipulation types, and surface heights.

2. **TUM Kitchen Dataset**: The TUM Kitchen dataset consists of videos of kitchen activities recorded by multiple cameras. The authors use a two-tier labeling system for activities, which includes motion verbs and object manipulation modes.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **UW-IOM Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Parsa, B., Samani, E. U., Hendrix, R., Devine, C., Singh, S. M., Devasia, S., & Banerjee, A. G. (2019). Toward ergonomic risk prediction via segmentation of indoor object manipulation actions using spatiotemporal convolutional networks. *IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters*, 4(4), 3153-3160.

- For the **TUM Kitchen Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Tenorth, M., Bandouch, J., & Beetz, M. (2009). The TUM kitchen data set of everyday manipulation activities for motion tracking and action recognition. In *IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision Workshops* (pp. 1089-1096).

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and includes its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, ready for further processing or review.
