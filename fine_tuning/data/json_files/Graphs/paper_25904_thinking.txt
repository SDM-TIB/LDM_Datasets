To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Large-scale Information Network Embedding" by Jian Tang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted empirical experiments on various real-world information networks, which suggests that datasets are involved. The introduction elaborates on the types of networks analyzed, indicating that specific datasets will likely be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **experiments**. In this paper, the relevant information is found in **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their evaluations. Here, they mention several datasets, including:

1. **Language Network**: A word co-occurrence network constructed from English Wikipedia pages, filtering out words with a frequency smaller than 5.
2. **Social Networks**: Two networks, **Flickr** and **Youtube**, are used, with specific characteristics provided for each.
3. **Citation Networks**: Two types of citation networks are mentioned, derived from the **DBLP dataset**, which includes author and paper citation networks.

In section 5.1, the authors provide detailed statistics for these networks, which will be crucial for my dataset extraction.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This involves checking the **References section** for any relevant citations or looking up the datasets online if they are not explicitly cited in the paper. 

The citations I need to compile are:

- For the **DBLP dataset**, the citation is:
  > Tang, J., Zhang, J., Yao, L., Li, J., Zhang, L., & Su, Z. (2008). Arnetminer: extraction and mining of academic social networks. In Proceedings of the 14th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining (pp. 990â€“998). ACM.

- For the **Flickr and Youtube networks**, while specific citations may not be provided in the paper, I can reference the original datasets as follows:
  > Flickr dataset: Available at [Flickr API](https://www.flickr.com/services/api/).
  > Youtube dataset: Available at [Youtube API](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3).

- For the **Wikipedia dataset**, I can cite it as:
  > Wikipedia: Available at [Wikipedia Dumps](https://dumps.wikimedia.org/).

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets in a structured manner, ensuring that each dataset entry includes its name, description, and full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
