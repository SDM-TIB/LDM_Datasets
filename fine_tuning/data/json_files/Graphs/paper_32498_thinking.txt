To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Robust Fraud Detection via Supervised Contrastive Learning" by Vinay M.S., Shuhan Yuan, and Xintao Wu, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their framework on benchmark datasets, which indicates that datasets are likely discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention three benchmark fraud detection datasets:

1. **CERT Dataset**: This dataset is described as a comprehensive dataset for insider threat detection, containing 48 malicious and 1,581,358 normal sessions. The authors provide details about the types of malicious sessions and the sampling strategy used for training and testing.

2. **UMD-Wikipedia Dataset**: This dataset consists of activity sessions from users who edited the Wikipedia website, with 5486 normal and 4627 malicious sessions. The authors explain how they constructed the training and test sets, including the sampling method based on malicious session clusters.

3. **OpenStack Dataset**: This dataset records user activity sessions on OpenStack cloud services, containing 244,908 normal and 18,434 malicious sessions. The authors detail their sampling strategy for both training and test sets.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:

- For the **CERT Dataset**:
  > Glasser, J., & Lindauer, B. (2013). Bridging the gap: A pragmatic approach to generating insider threat data. In IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy Workshops.

- For the **UMD-Wikipedia Dataset**:

  > Du, M., Li, F., Zheng, G., & Srikumar, V. (2017). Deeplog: Anomaly detection and diagnosis from system logs through deep learning. In Proceedings of the ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or analysis.
