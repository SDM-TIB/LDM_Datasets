To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Contrastive Multiview Network Embedding" by Mengqi Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments on three real-world datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically **section 3 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. They mention three datasets: **ACM**, **IMDB**, and **DBLP**. I will take note of the details provided about each dataset, including the types of relations, number of nodes, edges, attributes, and classes.

In **Table 1**, the authors provide a summary of the datasets, which includes:
- **ACM**: Contains item nodes with two types of relations: Paper–Author–Paper (P–A–P) and Paper–Subject–Paper (P–S–P). It has 3,025 nodes, 2,210,761 edges, 1,830 classes.
- **IMDB**: Contains movie nodes with Movie–Actor–Movie (M–A–M) and Movie–Director-Movie (M–D–M) relations. It has 3,550 nodes, 29,281 edges, and 1,007 classes.
- **DBLP**: Contains paper nodes with multiple relations: Paper–Paper–Paper (P–P–P), Paper–Author–Paper (P–A–P), and Paper–Author–Term–Author–Paper (P–A–T–A–P). It has 7,907 nodes, 66,428 edges, and 2,000 classes.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The authors do not provide specific citations for the datasets themselves, but I can infer that they are commonly used datasets in the field of network embedding and can be cited as follows:

- For **ACM** dataset, the citation is:
  > ACM. *ACM Digital Library*. Available at: https://www.acm.org/

- For **IMDB** dataset, the citation is:
  > IMDB. *Internet Movie Database*. Available at: https://www.imdb.com/

- For **DBLP** dataset, the citation is:
  > DBLP. *DBLP Computer Science Bibliography*. Available at: https://dblp.org/

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and full citation for each dataset. This will ensure that I have accurately captured all relevant details for downstream processing or review.
