To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Molecular Generative Graph Neural Networks for Drug Discovery" by Pietro Bongini et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. In the abstract, the authors mention that their model was evaluated on the **QM9** and **Zinc** datasets. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for understanding the experiments conducted in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In the **experiments section (Section 4)**, the authors provide a detailed description of both datasets:

1. **QM9 Dataset**: The paper describes QM9 as a subset of GDB-17, consisting of 133,885 compounds made up of up to 9 heavy atoms (C, O, N, F) and a maximum size of 29 atoms. Each molecule is represented as an undirected graph, with vertices corresponding to atoms and edges corresponding to chemical bonds.

2. **Zinc Dataset**: The Zinc dataset is described as containing 249,455 organic molecules with up to 38 heavy atoms (C, O, N, F, P, S, Cl, I, Br). The dataset includes explicit labeling of ring bonds as aromatic when part of an aromatic ring.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **QM9 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Ramakrishnan, R., Dral, P. O., Rupp, M., & von Lilienfeld, O. A. (2014). Quantum chemistry structures and properties of 134 kilo molecules. *Scientific Data*, 1, 140022.

- For the **Zinc Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Irwin, J. J., & Shoichet, B. K. (2005). Zinc- a free database of commercially available compounds for virtual screening. *Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling*, 45(1), 177-182.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or processing.
