To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Robust Face Anti-Spoofing with Dual Probabilistic Modeling" by Yuanhan Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple standard FAS benchmarks, which suggests that specific datasets are used for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used. In this section, they explicitly list the datasets employed in their experiments. I will look for any mentions of dataset names, descriptions, and the context in which they were used.

Upon reviewing the **experiments section**, I find that the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **Oulu-NPU**: This dataset is described as a mobile face presentation attack database with real-world variations. It is used to evaluate the proposed method's performance under various conditions.

2. **SiW**: The authors refer to this dataset as another standard benchmark for face anti-spoofing, which is used to assess the effectiveness of their approach.

3. **CASIA-MFSD**: This dataset is noted for containing diverse attacks and is utilized for cross-testing the proposed method.

4. **Replay-Attack**: This dataset is mentioned as part of the evaluation process, providing additional context for the robustness of the proposed method.

5. **CelebA-Spoof**: The authors highlight this large-scale dataset with rich annotations, which is particularly relevant due to its diversity and the challenges it presents in terms of noisy data.

Next, I will check the **References section** to gather full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access these datasets.

The full citations I find are:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that all relevant details are captured and properly attributed.
