To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Decentralized Market Mechanism for Energy Communities under Operating Envelopes" by Ahmed S. Alahmed et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to find any references to datasets. The abstract typically provides a concise overview, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or data sources.

Next, I will examine the **methodology section** in detail, as this is where the authors are likely to describe the datasets used for their analysis or experiments. I will look for specific names of datasets, their characteristics, and any relevant details such as the number of samples, types of data, and how they were collected or generated.

If the paper includes a **results or discussion section**, I will check for any additional context about the datasets, including how they were used in the analysis and any comparisons made with other datasets.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, if the authors mention using a dataset like the "PecanStreet dataset" for their analysis, I will look for the original source or publication that describes this dataset and note its citation.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the details into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described, including its name, purpose, and full citation.

Finally, I will ensure that the extracted information is accurate and complete, ready for any further processing or review.
