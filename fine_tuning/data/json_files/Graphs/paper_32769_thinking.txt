To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Exploring Self-Supervised Contrastive Learning of Spatial Sound Event Representation" by Xilin Jiang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions a framework for contrastive learning of spatial audios, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. However, the introduction discusses the challenges of audio pre-training models and hints at the use of datasets for sound event localization and detection.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments** section, particularly in **section 4 (Experiments)**. Here, the authors describe their data simulation process and mention the **FSDnoisy18k dataset**. This dataset is crucial as it is used to simulate 4-channel recordings for their experiments.

In **section 4.1 (Data Simulation)**, the authors provide details about the FSDnoisy18k dataset, stating that it comprises single-channel audio sources belonging to 20 different classes, with a larger noisy training set and a smaller clean training set. This section confirms that the FSDnoisy18k dataset is indeed used in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the FSDnoisy18k dataset. The citation provided in the references is:

> Eduardo Fonseca, Manoj Plakal, Daniel P. W. Ellis, Frederic Font, Xavier Favory, and Xavier Serra. *FSD50K: An open dataset of human-labeled sound events*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP), 2022, pp. 21â€“25.

Since the authors refer to the FSDnoisy18k dataset in the context of their experiments, I will ensure to include this citation in my dataset extraction.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including the name, description, and citation, into a structured format for further processing.

In summary, the key steps I followed are:
1. Read the abstract and introduction for initial context.
2. Identify the relevant section (Experiments) for dataset mentions.
3. Extract the dataset name and details from the experiments section.
4. Retrieve the full citation from the references section.
5. Prepare the dataset information for structured output.
