To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On the Limit of Explaining Black-box Temporal Graph Neural Networks" by Minh N. Vu and My T. Thai, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the research, which may include mentions of datasets used.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this paper, the authors mention using synthetic datasets and real-world datasets for their evaluations. I will look for specific names and details of these datasets.

In the **experiments section**, the authors describe several synthetic datasets, including "Agg 1," "Agg 2," "Prop 1," and "Prop 2." They also mention using real-world datasets such as **Cora**, **Citeseer**, and **Pubmed**. I will take note of these names and any relevant details provided about the datasets, such as their characteristics or the tasks they are used for.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. This is crucial for proper attribution. The authors may cite the original sources of the datasets, which I will need to include in my documentation.

For the synthetic datasets, the paper does not provide full citations since they are constructed for the study, but I will document their descriptions as provided in the paper. For the real-world datasets, I will look for their original sources in the references.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citations for the real-world datasets and detailed descriptions for the synthetic datasets.

1. **Synthetic Datasets**:
   - **Agg 1**: A dataset constructed for aggregation tasks with specific features and roles.
   - **Agg 2**: Similar to Agg 1 but with different configurations.
   - **Prop 1**: A dataset designed for propagation tasks.
   - **Prop 2**: Another dataset for propagation tasks with different characteristics.

2. **Real-World Datasets**:
   - **Cora**:

   - **Citeseer**: 
     > Sen, P., Namata, G., Bilgic, M., Getoor, L., Galligher, B., & Eliassi-Rad, T. (2008). Collective Classification in Network Data. AI Magazine, 29(3), 93.
   - **Pubmed**: 
     > Sen, P., Namata, G., Bilgic, M., Getoor, L., Galligher, B., & Eliassi-Rad, T. (2008). Collective Classification in Network Data. AI Magazine, 29(3), 93.

Finally, I will ensure that all the extracted information is clearly documented and ready for further processing or review.
