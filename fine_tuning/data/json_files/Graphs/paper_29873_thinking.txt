To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Open-Vocabulary 3D Detection via Image-level Class and Debiased Cross-modal Contrastive Learning" by Yuheng Lu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. In the abstract, the authors mention that their method achieves improvements on the **SUN-RGBD dataset** and **ScanNet dataset**. This indicates that these datasets are likely used in their experiments.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (specifically section 4.1) where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they mention:

1. **SUN RGB-D Dataset**: This dataset is widely used for 3D scene understanding and contains RGB-D images along with annotations for various objects.
2. **ScanNet Dataset**: Another popular dataset for 3D reconstruction and object detection, which includes richly annotated indoor scenes.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to guide readers to the original sources.

The full citations I will extract are:

- For **SUN RGB-D Dataset**:
  > Shuran Song, Samuel P Lichtenberg, and Jianxiong Xiao. *SUN RGB-D: A RGB-D Scene Understanding Benchmark Suite*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 567–576, 2015.

- For **ScanNet Dataset**:
  > Angela Dai, Angel X. Chang, Manolis Savva, Maciej Halber, Thomas Funkhouser, and Matthias Nießner. *ScanNet: Richly-annotated 3D Reconstructions of Indoor Scenes*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 5748–5758, 2017.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets, including their names, descriptions, and citations, ensuring that I maintain clarity and accuracy in the representation of each dataset's significance in the research.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that is ready for review or further processing.
