To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On the Bottleneck of Graph Neural Networks and Its Practical Implications" by Uri Alon and Eran Yahav, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and evaluation sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges faced by Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and mention that they will demonstrate their findings using various datasets. This indicates that datasets will be discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **evaluation section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this paper, I will look for sections labeled with headings like "Datasets" or "Experiments" to find specific mentions of datasets.

Upon reviewing the paper, I identify the following datasets:

1. **QM9 Dataset**: This dataset is described as containing approximately 130,000 graphs, where each graph represents a molecule with nodes as atoms and edges as bonds. The goal is to predict 13 quantum chemical properties. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Ramakrishnan, R., O'Dral, P. O., Rupp, M., & von Lilienfeld, O. A. (2014). Quantum chemistry structures and properties of 134 kilo molecules. *Scientific Data*, 1, 140022.

2. **NCI1 Dataset**: This dataset consists of 4,110 graphs, each representing a biochemical compound, and the task is to predict whether it has anti-lung-cancer activity. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Wale, N., Watson, I. A., & Karypis, G. (2008). Comparison of descriptor spaces for chemical compound retrieval and classification. *Knowledge and Information Systems*, 14(3), 347-375.

3. **ENZYMES Dataset**: This dataset contains 600 graphs, each representing an enzyme, and the task is to classify it into one of six classes. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Borgwardt, K. M., Ong, C. S., SchÃ¶nauer, K., Vishwanathan, S. V. N., Smola, A. J., & Kriegel, H. P. (2005). Protein function prediction via graph kernels. *Bioinformatics*, 21(suppl_1), i47-i56.

4. **VARMISUSE Dataset**: This dataset is used for a node-prediction problem in computer programs, requiring long-range information. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Allamanis, M., Brockschmidt, M., & Khademi, M. (2018). Learning to represent programs with graphs. In *International Conference on Learning Representations*.

After identifying these datasets, I will ensure to document their full citations accurately, as they are crucial for proper referencing in any subsequent analysis or application of the research findings.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for easy reference and further processing.
