To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Detecting Anomalous Cryptocurrency Transactions: an AML/CFT Application of Machine Learning-based Forensics" by Nadia Pocher et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the paper analyzes a real-world dataset of Bitcoin transactions, which suggests that a dataset is indeed present.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, specifically looking for any explicit mentions of datasets. In this section, the authors state that they used the **Elliptic transactions dataset** for their experiments. This dataset is described as containing real Bitcoin transactions represented as a directed graph network, which is crucial for understanding the context of their analysis.

I will also check the **experiments section** to confirm the details about the dataset. The authors provide specific information about the dataset, including the number of transaction nodes and edges, as well as the features available for each transaction. This detailed description will help in accurately documenting the dataset.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The authors reference the dataset as being publicly available on Kaggle, specifically from the work of Weber et al. (2019). Therefore, I will need to cite this original source.

The full citation for the dataset is:
> Weber, M., Domeniconi, G., Chen, J., Weidele, D.K.I., Bellei, C., Robinson, T., & Leiserson, C.E. (2019). *Anti-Money Laundering in Bitcoin: Experimenting with Graph Convolutional Networks for Financial Forensics*. Retrieved from http://arxiv.org/abs/1908.02591

After gathering all this information, I will summarize the dataset as follows:

1. **Elliptic Transactions Dataset**: This dataset contains 203,769 transaction nodes connected by 234,355 edges, with each transaction labeled as illicit, licit, or unknown. It includes 167 features per transaction, which are crucial for the analysis of money laundering activities.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that the full citation for the dataset is included for proper attribution.
