To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Dynamic Neural Control Flow Execution: An Agent-Based Deep Equilibrium Approach for Binary Vulnerability Detection" by Litao Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that experiments were conducted on **two semi-synthetic and two real-world datasets**, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experiment)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention:

1. **NDSS18 Dataset**: This dataset is derived from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and is used for vulnerability detection tasks. It includes a total of 32,281 binary functions compiled from source code.

2. **Juliet Test Suite**: This dataset consists of 81,000 test cases in C/C++ and Java, containing various vulnerabilities. It is also sourced from NIST.

3. **FFmpeg Dataset**: This dataset is compiled from the FFmpeg open-source project, which includes 16,494 binary functions, with 7,257 being vulnerable.

4. **Esh Dataset**: This dataset contains CVE cases collected by David et al. (2016), with a total of 3,379 cases, of which only 60 are vulnerable.

I will then verify the details of these datasets in the **Appendix A.2 (Datasets and Setup)** section, which provides additional context and confirms the datasets mentioned in the experiments section.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset from the references section or the text itself:

- For the **NDSS18 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Li, Z., et al. (2018). *VulDeePecker: A deep learning-based system for vulnerability detection*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1801.01681.

- For the **Juliet Test Suite**, the citation is:
  > National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). *Juliet Test Suite*. Available at: https://samate.nist.gov/SARD/test-suites.

- For the **FFmpeg Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Zhou, Y., et al. (2019). *Devign: Effective vulnerability identification by learning comprehensive program semantics via graph neural networks*. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems.

- For the **Esh Dataset**, the citation is:
  > David, Y., Partush, N., & Yahav, E. (2016). *Statistical similarity of binaries*. ACM Sigplan Notices, 51(6), 266-280.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This structured approach will help in accurately extracting and documenting the datasets used in the research paper.
