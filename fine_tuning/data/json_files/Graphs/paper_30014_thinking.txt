To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Contrastive UCB: Provably Efficient Contrastive Self-Supervised Learning in Online Reinforcement Learning" by Shuang Qiu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for evaluation. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets, while the methodology and experiments sections typically detail the datasets used in the experiments.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the integration of contrastive self-supervised learning into reinforcement learning, which may hint at the datasets used for empirical validation. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or benchmarks.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**. This section usually contains detailed information about the datasets used, including their names, sizes, and characteristics. I will look for any subsections specifically dedicated to datasets or experimental setups.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find the following datasets mentioned:

1. **Atari 100K**: This dataset is used for evaluating the proposed methods in various Atari games. It consists of 26 games and is designed to test the sample efficiency of reinforcement learning algorithms.

2. **OpenAI Gym**: The authors mention using environments from OpenAI Gym for additional experiments, which is a standard benchmark for reinforcement learning.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the references section of the paper:

- For **Atari 100K**, the citation is:
  > Kaiser, Ł., Babaeizadeh, M., Miłos, P., Osiński, B., Campbell, R. H., Czechowski, K., Erhan, D., Finn, C., Kozakowski, P., Levine, S., et al. *Model based reinforcement learning for atari*. In International Conference on Learning Representations, 2020.

- For **OpenAI Gym**, the citation is:
  > Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L. H., Schneider, J., Shinn, J., et al. *OpenAI Gym*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01540, 2016.

After identifying the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information in a structured format for easy reference.

In summary, I will document the datasets as follows:

1. **Dataset Name**: Atari 100K
   - **Description**: A benchmark consisting of 26 Atari games used to evaluate reinforcement learning algorithms.
   - **Citation**: Kaiser, Ł., et al. *Model based reinforcement learning for atari*. In International Conference on Learning Representations, 2020.

2. **Dataset Name**: OpenAI Gym
   - **Description**: A toolkit for developing and comparing reinforcement learning algorithms.
   - **Citation**: Brockman, G., et al. *OpenAI Gym*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01540, 2016.

This structured approach ensures that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.
