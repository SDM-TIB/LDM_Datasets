To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Predicting Multidimensional Data via Tensor Learning" by Giuseppe Brandi and T. Di Matteo, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and empirical application sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors perform an empirical analysis using a spatio-temporal dataset and a macroeconomic panel dataset, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **empirical application section (Section 5)**, where the authors provide details about the datasets used. Here, they mention two datasets:

1. **Foursquare Dataset**: This dataset consists of users' check-in records in the Pittsburgh area between February 24, 2012, and May 24, 2012. It is described as a 3rd order tensor of dimension 121 × 15 × 1198, representing the number of check-ins by 121 users across 15 different types of venues over 1198 time periods.

2. **Macroeconomic Panel Dataset**: This dataset is a subsample of data on Global VAR, containing quarterly data from 1979Q2 to 2016Q4 for various economic indicators across 19 countries. The authors note that this dataset results in a tensor of dimension 150 × 6 × 19, with a co-efficient tensor of dimension 6 × 19 × 6 × 19.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. However, the datasets themselves do not appear to have specific citations provided in the references, as they are likely derived from publicly available data sources or previous studies. Therefore, I will note that the Foursquare dataset is commonly used in research contexts and can be referenced as follows:

- For the **Foursquare Dataset**, I will cite:
  > Yu, R., Cheng, D., & Liu, Y. (2015). Accelerated online low rank tensor learning for multivariate spatiotemporal streams. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML).

- For the **Macroeconomic Panel Dataset**, I will cite:
  > Mohaddes, K., & Raissi, M. (2018). Compilation, revision and updating of the global VAR (GVAR) database, 1979Q2-2016Q4. Apollo - University of Cambridge Repository.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its citation for future reference.
