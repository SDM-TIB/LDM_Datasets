To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Information Theory-Guided Heuristic Progressive Multi-View Coding" by Jiangmeng Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** of the paper. The abstract typically provides a concise overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the work, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will specifically look for sections that mention datasets, such as **"Experiments"** or **"Datasets"**. In this paper, I will pay close attention to any tables or figures that might summarize the datasets used in the experiments.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention using several benchmark datasets for their experiments. I will note down the names of these datasets and any relevant details provided, such as the number of samples, types of data, and specific characteristics that are highlighted.

For instance, the paper mentions using the following datasets:

1. **Tiny ImageNet**: A dataset containing 200 classes with 500 training images per class, used for image classification tasks.
2. **CIFAR-10**: A well-known dataset consisting of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, commonly used for training machine learning models.
3. **CIFAR-100**: Similar to CIFAR-10 but with 100 classes, each containing 600 images.
4. **STL-10**: A dataset designed for unsupervised feature learning, containing 10 classes with 5,000 labeled images and 100,000 unlabeled images.

Next, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for these datasets. It is crucial to provide accurate citations to ensure proper attribution and allow others to access the datasets easily.

The full citations for the datasets mentioned are as follows:

- **Tiny ImageNet**:

- **CIFAR-10**:

- **STL-10**: 
  > Coates, A., Ng, A. Y., & Lee, H. (2011). *An analysis of single-layer networks in unsupervised feature learning*. In Proceedings of the Fourteenth International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics (AISTATS).

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described clearly and that the citations are formatted correctly for inclusion in any subsequent documentation or analysis.
