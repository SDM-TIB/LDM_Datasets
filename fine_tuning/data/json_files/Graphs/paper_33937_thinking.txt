To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Understanding and Mitigating Human-Labelling Errors in Supervised Contrastive Learning" by Zijun Long et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the impact of human-labelling errors on supervised contrastive learning, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 6 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention evaluating their method on several benchmarks, specifically:

1. **CIFAR-10**: A well-known dataset for image classification containing 60,000 images across 10 classes.
2. **CIFAR-100**: Similar to CIFAR-10 but with 100 classes, containing 60,000 images.
3. **ImageNet-1K**: A large-scale dataset with over a million images across 1,000 classes, widely used in image classification tasks.

In this section, the authors provide performance metrics for their proposed method on these datasets, confirming their use in the experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009.

- For **CIFAR-100**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009.

- For **ImageNet-1K**, the citation is:
  > Olga Russakovsky, Jia Deng, Hao Sheng, et al. *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 115(3):211-252, 2015.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
