To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Bundle Recommendation with Graph Convolutional Networks" by Jianxin Chang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that empirical results are demonstrated on **two real-world datasets**, which indicates that datasets are present.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Experimental Settings)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for evaluation. They describe two datasets:

1. **Netease**: This dataset is sourced from the largest music platform in China and allows users to bundle songs based on specific themes or add bundles to their favorites.

2. **Youshu**: This dataset is constructed from Youshu, a Chinese book review site, where each bundle represents a list of books that users desire.

In this section, the authors provide statistics about these datasets, including the number of users, items, bundles, and interactions, which further confirms their relevance.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **Netease**, the citation is:
  > Da Cao, Liqiang Nie, Xiangnan He, Xiaochi Wei, Shunzhi Zhu, and Tat-Seng Chua. *Embedding factorization models for jointly recommending items and user generated lists*. In Proceedings of the 40th International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval (SIGIR), pages 585–594, 2017.

- For **Youshu**, the citation is:
  > Liang Chen, Yang Liu, Xiangnan He, Lianli Gao, and Zibin Zheng. *Matching user with item set: collaborative bundle recommendation with deep attention network*. In Proceedings of the 28th International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI), pages 2095–2101, 2019.

With this information, I will summarize the datasets and their citations clearly, ensuring that I have captured all necessary details for future reference or processing.
