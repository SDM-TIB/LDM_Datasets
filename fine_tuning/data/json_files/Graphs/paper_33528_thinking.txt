To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Relaxed Contrastive Learning for Federated Learning" by Seonguk Seo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses a novel contrastive learning framework but does not specify datasets. However, the introduction mentions challenges in federated learning, which may lead to the use of specific datasets for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experiment)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. They mention three standard benchmarks: **CIFAR-10**, **CIFAR-100**, and **Tiny-ImageNet**. Each of these datasets is crucial for understanding the performance of their proposed method.

In the **experimental setup**, the authors detail how they generate i.i.d. and non-i.i.d. data splits from these datasets, indicating their importance in the experiments. They also specify that they use the complete test sets for evaluation, which further confirms the datasets' relevance.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

1. **CIFAR-10**: The citation is:
   > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton, et al. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. 2009.

2. **CIFAR-100**: The citation is:
   > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton, et al. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. 2009.

3. **Tiny-ImageNet**: The citation is:
   > Ya Le and Xuan Yang. *Tiny ImageNet Visual Recognition Challenge*. CS 231N, 7(7):3, 2015.

Although CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 share the same citation, it is important to note that they are distinct datasets.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes its full citation. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
