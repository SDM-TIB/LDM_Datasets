To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Versatile Multi-Modal Pre-Training for Human-Centric Perception" by Fangzhou Hong et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to gather initial insights about the datasets used. The abstract mentions the contribution of a new RGB-D human parsing dataset called **NTURGBD-Parsing-4K**, which is a strong indicator that this dataset is significant for the research.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for training and evaluation. In this section, they explicitly mention the **NTU RGB+D dataset** and the **MPII dataset** as part of their pre-training process. The NTU RGB+D dataset is noted for providing paired RGB and depth data, which is crucial for their multi-modal approach.

I will also check the **results section** to confirm the datasets used in various experiments. The authors discuss their performance on tasks involving **DensePose estimation** and **human parsing**, which further validates the use of the NTU RGB+D dataset and the newly introduced NTURGBD-Parsing-4K dataset.

Now, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

1. **NTURGBD Dataset**:
   > Jun Liu, Amir Shahroudy, Mauricio Perez, Gang Wang, Ling-Yu Duan, and Alex C. Kot. *NTU RGB+D: A Large Scale Benchmark for 3D Human Activity Understanding*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 1010â€“1019, 2016.

2. **MPII Dataset**:
   > Mykhaylo Andriluka, Leonid Pishchulin, Peter Gehler, and Bernt Schiele. *2D Human Pose Estimation: New Benchmark and State of the Art Analysis*. In IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), June 2014.

3. **NTURGBD-Parsing-4K Dataset**:
   > Fangzhou Hong, Liang Pan, Zhongang Cai, and Ziwei Liu. *NTURGBD-Parsing-4K: A New RGB-D Human Parsing Dataset*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2023.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

- **NTURGBD Dataset**: A large-scale dataset providing RGB and depth data for 3D human activity understanding.
- **MPII Dataset**: A benchmark dataset for 2D human pose estimation.
- **NTURGBD-Parsing-4K Dataset**: A newly introduced dataset specifically for RGB-D human parsing tasks.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
