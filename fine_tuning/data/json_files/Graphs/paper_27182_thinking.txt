To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ANL: Anti-Noise Learning for Cross-Domain Person Re-Identification" by Hongliang Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the experiments are conducted on "three large-scale Re-ID benchmarks," which indicates that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they mention:

1. **Market-1501**: This dataset is described as being collected with 6 different cameras, containing 751 identities and 12,936 images in the training set, with a test set of 750 identities, 3,368 images in the query set, and 19,732 images in the gallery set.

2. **DukeMTMC-ReID**: This dataset is a sub-dataset of DukeMTMC, collected from 8 different cameras. It includes 702 identities and 16,522 images in the training set, with a test set of 702 identities, 2,228 images in the query set, and 17,611 images in the gallery set.

3. **CUHK03**: This dataset was captured by 2 cameras and constructed using both manual labeling and DPM. The training set includes 767 identities and 7,365 images, while the test set includes 700 identities, with 1,400 images in the query set and 5,332 images in the gallery set.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **Market-1501**, the citation is:
  > Zheng, L., Shen, L., Tian, L., Wang, S., Wang, J., & Tian, Q. (2015). *Scalable Person Re-identification: A Benchmark*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pp. 1116-1124.

- For **DukeMTMC-ReID**, the citation is:
  > Ristani, E., Solera, F., Zou, R. S., Cucchiara, R., & Tomasi, C. (2016). *Performance Measures and a Data Set for Multi-Target, Multi-Camera Tracking*. In Proceedings of the European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), pp. 17-35.

- For **CUHK03**, the citation is:
  > Wu, Y., Zhang, L., & Wang, Y. (2017). *Deep Re-ID: Deep Filter Pairing Neural Network for Person Re-identification*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pp. 152-159.

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this into a structured format for further processing or review.
