To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ICE: Inter-instance Contrastive Encoding for Unsupervised Person Re-identification" by Hao Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that experiments were conducted on several large-scale person ReID datasets, which indicates that specific datasets will be discussed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets and Evaluation Protocols)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for evaluation. Here, I will look for detailed descriptions of each dataset, including the number of images, identities, and any specific characteristics that are relevant to their use in the experiments.

In this section, the authors mention three datasets:

1. **Market-1501**: This dataset is described as containing 12,936 images of 751 identities for training and 19,732 images of 750 identities for testing, collected from 6 cameras.

2. **DukeMTMC-reID**: This dataset is a subset of the DukeMTMC dataset, containing 16,522 images of 702 persons for training, along with 2,228 query images and 17,661 gallery images for testing, collected from 8 cameras.

3. **MSMT17**: This dataset is noted for being large-scale, containing 32,621 training images of 1,041 identities and 93,820 testing images of 3,060 identities collected from 15 cameras.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **Market-1501**, the citation is:
  > Liang Zheng, Liyue Shen, Lu Tian, Shengjin Wang, Jingdong Wang, and Qi Tian. *Scalable person re-identification: A benchmark*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 2151â€“2158, 2015.

- For **DukeMTMC-reID**, the citation is:
  > Ergys Ristani, Francesco Solera, Roger Zou, Rita Cucchiara, and Carlo Tomasi. *Performance measures and a data set for multi-target, multi-camera tracking*. In Proceedings of the European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV) Workshops, 2016.

- For **MSMT17**, the citation is:
  > Zhun Zhong, Liang Zheng, Guoliang Kang, Shaozi Li, and Yi Yang. *Random erasing data augmentation*. In Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, 2020.

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and full citation for each dataset. This will ensure that the information is clear and accessible for future reference or processing.
