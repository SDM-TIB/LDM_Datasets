To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Clustering Aware Classification for Risk Prediction & Subtyping in Clinical Data" by Shivin Srivastava et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the research context and any datasets that may be referenced. The abstract mentions experiments on "synthetic and real benchmark datasets," which indicates that there are datasets used in the study.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments** section. In this paper, there is a **Table 1** that summarizes the datasets used, which includes:

1. **Sepsis Dataset**: This dataset is derived from the 2019 Physionet challenge for sepsis onset prediction, containing time-series records of approximately 40,000 patients.
2. **WID Mortality Dataset**: This dataset is from the Women In Data Science challenge, aimed at predicting patient mortality.
3. **Diabetes Dataset**: Sourced from the UCI Repository, this dataset is used for predicting patient readmission.
4. **Respiratory Dataset**: This dataset was extracted for the task of predicting Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS).
5. **CIC Dataset**: This dataset is from the 2012 Physionet challenge, used to predict in-hospital mortality of ICU patients.
6. **CIC-LOS Dataset**: A derived multiclass dataset from the CIC dataset, predicting Length of Stay (LOS) in the ICU.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. 

The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- **Sepsis Dataset**: 
  > Reyna, M. A., et al. "Early prediction of sepsis from clinical data: the PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology Challenge." In Computing in Cardiology, 2019.

- **WID Mortality Dataset**: 
  > Lee, M., et al. "WiDS (Women in Data Science) Datathon 2020: ICU Mortality Prediction." 2020.

- **Diabetes Dataset**: 
  > Lichman, M. "UCI Repository of Machine Learning Datasets." 2013.

- **Respiratory Dataset**: 
  > (This dataset does not have a specific citation in the text, but it is mentioned as extracted for ARDS prediction.)

- **CIC Dataset**: 
  > Silva, I., et al. "Predicting in-hospital mortality of ICU patients: The PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology Challenge 2012." In Computing in Cardiology, 2012.

- **CIC-LOS Dataset**: 
  > (This dataset is derived from the CIC dataset and does not have a separate citation.)

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, facilitating further exploration or replication of the study.
