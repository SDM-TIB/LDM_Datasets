To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CeFi vs. DeFi â€” Comparing Centralized to Decentralized Finance" by Kaihua Qin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a high-level overview of the paper's focus on comparing CeFi and DeFi, but it may not specify datasets directly.

Next, I will examine the **background and case study sections** for any references to datasets. In particular, I will look for any tables, figures, or specific mentions of data sources that the authors used to support their analysis. 

In the **case studies and analysis sections**, the authors discuss various financial instruments and market behaviors in both CeFi and DeFi. I will pay close attention to any empirical data or datasets referenced, especially in the context of market manipulation, transaction costs, and financial performance.

If the paper includes a **results or discussion section**, I will check for any datasets that were analyzed or compared. This may include quantitative data on transaction volumes, market prices, or user behavior in both CeFi and DeFi environments.

After identifying potential datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the original data sources.

For example, if the paper references a dataset related to transaction volumes in DeFi, I will look for the original source of that data, such as a specific blockchain analytics report or a financial database.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the datasets into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation.

Finally, I will review the extracted information to ensure accuracy and completeness before finalizing the dataset documentation.
