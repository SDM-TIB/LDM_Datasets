To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Adaptive Hypergraph Convolutional Network for No-Reference 360-degree Image Quality Assessment" by Jun Fu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on **two public 360IQA databases**, indicating that datasets are present.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors describe their methodology and the datasets used. In this section, they specifically mention the two datasets:

1. **OIQA Database**: This dataset contains 320 distorted 360-degree images obtained by applying four distortion types with five levels to 16 raw 360-degree images. The mean opinion score (MOS) values for the distorted images range from 1 to 10.

2. **CVIQD Database**: This dataset consists of 528 compressed 360-degree images generated from 16 lossless source images. It includes three compression distortion types: JPEG, H.264/AVC, and H.265/HEVC, with MOS values normalized and rescaled to the range [0, 100].

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **OIQA Database**, the citation is:
  > W. Sun, K. Gu, S. Ma, W. Zhu, N. Liu, and G. Zhai. "A large-scale compressed 360-degree spherical image database: From subjective quality evaluation to objective model comparison." In 2018 IEEE 20th International Workshop on Multimedia Signal Processing (MMSP), pp. 1–6, 2018.

- For the **CVIQD Database**, the citation is:
  > H. Duan, G. Zhai, X. Min, Y. Zhu, Y. Fang, and X. Yang. "Perceptual quality assessment of omnidirectional images." In 2018 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS), pp. 1–5, 2018.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
