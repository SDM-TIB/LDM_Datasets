To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Supervised Contrastive Learning with Tree-Structured Parzen Estimator Bayesian Optimization for Imbalanced Tabular Data" by Shuting Tao et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that experiments were conducted on **binary and multi-class imbalanced tabular datasets**, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Experimental Design)**, where the authors mention that the proposed method was evaluated on **eight binary and seven multi-class imbalanced datasets** collected from the KEEL and UCI repositories. This section is likely to provide the names and details of the datasets used.

In **Table 1**, the authors list the datasets along with their characteristics, including size, number of features, class distribution, and the data repository they were sourced from. The datasets mentioned include:

1. **Glass0**: Size 214, 8 features, class distribution 144/70, sourced from KEEL.
2. **Ecoli2**: Size 336, 7 features, class distribution 284/52, sourced from KEEL.
3. **Yeast3**: Size 1484, 8 features, class distribution 1321/163, sourced from KEEL.
4. **Yeast6**: Size 1484, 8 features, class distribution 1449/35, sourced from KEEL.
5. **Vowel0**: Size 988, 13 features, class distribution 90/898, sourced from KEEL.
6. **Haberman**: Size 306, 3 features, class distribution 225/81, sourced from KEEL.
7. **Yeast24**: Size 514, 8 features, class distribution 463/51, sourced from KEEL.
8. **Pageblock0**: Size 5472, 10 features, class distribution 4913/559, sourced from KEEL.
9. **Scale Balance**: Size 625, 4 features, class distribution 49/288/288, sourced from KEEL.
10. **Wine**: Size 178, 13 features, class distribution 59/71/48, sourced from UCI.
11. **Lymphography**: Size 148, 18 features, class distribution 70/76/17/13/9/29, sourced from KEEL.
12. **Glass**: Size 214, 9 features, class distribution 70/76/17/13/9/29, sourced from KEEL.
13. **Pageblocks**: Size 548, 10 features, class distribution 492/33/3/8/12, sourced from KEEL.
14. **Dermatology**: Size 358, 34 features, class distribution 115/114/114/106/114/106/105/115/105/106, sourced from KEEL.
15. **Penbased**: Size 1100, 16 features, class distribution 1/1/1/1/1/1/1/1/1/1, sourced from KEEL.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. However, since the datasets are sourced from repositories (KEEL and UCI), I will note that the datasets themselves may not have individual citations but are part of the respective repositories.

For the KEEL repository, the citation is:
> J. Alcalá-Fdez, A. Fernández, J. Luengo, J. Derrac, S. García, L. Sánchez, F. Herrera. *KEEL data-mining software tool: data set repository, integration of algorithms and experimental analysis framework*. Journal of Multiple-Valued Logic & Soft Computing, 17 (2011).

For the UCI repository, the citation is:
> A. Asuncion, D. Newman. *UCI machine learning repository*. 2007.

With this information, I can now compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for the repositories where the datasets are sourced from.
