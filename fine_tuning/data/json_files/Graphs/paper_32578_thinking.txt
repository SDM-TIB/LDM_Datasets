To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Machine Vision Method for Correction of Eccentric Error: Based on Adaptive Enhancement Algorithm" by Fanyi Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, but I need to look for specific mentions of datasets in the main body of the paper.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the need for precise detection of surface defects in large-aperture aspherical optical elements, but they do not mention any datasets directly. I will continue to the methodology and experiments sections for more details.

Next, I will check the **experiments section** where the authors describe their experimental setup and results. Here, they mention using a specific dataset for their experiments, particularly in the context of testing their proposed method. I will look for any tables or figures that might summarize the datasets used.

Upon reviewing the experiments, I find that the authors refer to a dataset of **420 crosshair images** collected during their experiments. However, they do not provide a formal name for this dataset or a citation. I will note this dataset and its context, but I will also need to check the **references section** to see if any prior works are cited that may have used similar datasets or provided foundational data.

In the **references section**, I will look for any papers that might have introduced or used datasets relevant to the experiments conducted in this paper. If any of these references describe datasets, I will extract their full citations.

After gathering all relevant information, I will compile the datasets identified, ensuring to include the full citations for any datasets mentioned in the references. If the authors did not provide a formal citation for the dataset they used, I will note that as well.

Finally, I will summarize the findings in a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its citation, if available. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
