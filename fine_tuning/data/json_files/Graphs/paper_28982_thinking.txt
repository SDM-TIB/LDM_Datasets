To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Enhancing ASR for Stuttered Speech with Limited Data Using Detect and Pass" by Olabanji Shonibare et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and datasets section** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the challenges faced by People Who Stutter (PWS) and hints at the use of a limited dataset for training a classifier. This suggests that there may be specific datasets referenced later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Datasets)**, as this section is likely to provide detailed information about the datasets used in the experiments. Here, the authors mention that they collected speech samples from people who self-identified as PWS, totaling **21 hours of data from 94 unique speakers**, comprising **17,000 utterances**. This indicates that the authors created their own dataset for the study.

I will also look for any references to existing datasets that may have been used or compared in the study. In the **related work section**, the authors mention the **UCLASS dataset**, which is relevant to stuttering detection. This dataset is crucial for understanding the context of their work and may be used for comparison.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to gather full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. For the **UCLASS dataset**, the citation is:
   > Peter Howell, Stephen Davis, and Jon Bartrip. *The University College London Archive of Stuttered Speech (UCLASS)*, 2009.

2. For the dataset created by the authors, since it is not a publicly available dataset, I will note it as:
   > Olabanji Shonibare, Xiaosu Tong, and Venkatesh Ravichandran. *Dataset of stuttered speech samples collected from 94 unique speakers*, 2022. (This citation is a placeholder since the dataset is not formally published.)

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations. This will ensure that all relevant datasets are documented accurately for future reference or analysis.
