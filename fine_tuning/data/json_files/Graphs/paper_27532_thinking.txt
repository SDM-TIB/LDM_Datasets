To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Scene Graph Embeddings Using Relative Similarity Supervision" by Paridhi Maheshwari et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of scene graphs and embeddings for image retrieval, which suggests that datasets related to images and scene graphs may be involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this paper, the authors specifically mention working with the **Visual Genome dataset**. They provide details about the dataset, including the number of images, the types of annotations, and the filtering criteria applied.

In the **dataset description**, the authors state that they use a subset of **51,498 images** from the Visual Genome dataset, which have user-provided textual captions from MS-COCO. They also mention filtering object and relationship types that occur at least 25 times, resulting in 2416 object and 478 relationship categories. This detailed description confirms the dataset's relevance to their work.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citation for the Visual Genome dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:

> Krishna, R.; Zhu, Y.; Groth, O.; Johnson, J.; Hata, K.; Kravitz, J.; Chen, S.; Kalantidis, Y.; Li, L.-J.; Shamma, D. A.; et al. *Visual genome: Connecting language and vision using crowdsourced dense image annotations*. International journal of computer vision 123(1): 32â€“73, 2017.

With this information, I can now summarize the dataset extraction process:

1. Identify the relevant sections of the paper (abstract, introduction, experiments).
2. Locate the specific dataset mentioned (Visual Genome).
3. Gather details about the dataset (number of images, filtering criteria).
4. Retrieve the full citation from the references.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format for further use.
