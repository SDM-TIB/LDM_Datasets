To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Residual Network based Aggregation Model for Skin Lesion Classification" by Yongsheng Pan and Yong Xia, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors applied their algorithm on the **International Skin Imaging Collaboration 2018 (ISIC2018)** challenge, which suggests that this dataset is relevant.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors provide more details about the dataset. In **section 3.1 (Materials)**, they mention that their data was extracted from the ISIC 2018 dataset, which consists of **11,720 images** across seven skin lesion categories. They also provide information about the distribution of the dataset, indicating that it is imbalanced and primarily consists of melanoma samples, with specific splits for training, validation, and testing.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the ISIC 2018 dataset. The relevant citation is:

- For the **ISIC 2018 dataset**, the citation is:
  > Noel C. F. Codella, David Gutman, M.E.C.B.H.M.A.M.S.W.D.A.K.K.L.N.M.H.K.A.H.: Skin lesion analysis toward melanoma detection: A challenge at the 2017 international symposium on biomedical imaging (ISBI), hosted by the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC). arXiv preprint arXiv:1710.05006 (2017).

Since the authors do not mention any other datasets in the paper, I will conclude that the ISIC 2018 dataset is the only dataset used for their experiments.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry for the ISIC 2018 dataset, ensuring to include the full citation as required. This will be ready for downstream processing or review.
