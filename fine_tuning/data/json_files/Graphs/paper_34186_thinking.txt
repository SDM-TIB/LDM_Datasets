To extract datasets from the research paper titled "scCDCG: Efficient Deep Structural Clustering for single-cell RNA-seq via Deep Cut-informed Graph Embedding" by Ping Xu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted extensive experiments on **6 datasets**, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **results section**, particularly **section 4.1 (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors summarize the datasets used for their experiments. They mention that they assessed the performance of their model using six scRNA-seq datasets, and they provide a table (Table 1) that lists these datasets along with their characteristics.

The datasets mentioned in the paper are:

1. **Human Pancreas cells 2**: Sample size of 1724, with 20125 genes and 14 groups.
2. **Meuro Human Pancreas cells**: Sample size of 2122, with 19046 genes and 9 groups.
3. **Mouse Bladder cells**: Sample size of 2746, with 20670 genes and 16 groups.
4. **Worm Neuron cells**: Sample size of 4186, with 13488 genes and 10 groups.
5. **CITE-CMBC**: Sample size of 8617, with 2000 genes and 15 groups.
6. **Human Liver cells**: Sample size of 8444, with 4999 genes and 11 groups.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The paper does not provide specific citations for each dataset directly, but I can infer that the datasets are likely derived from previous studies or publicly available datasets. 

For example, the **Human Pancreas cells 2** dataset is referenced in the paper by Maayan Baron et al. (2016), and the **Mouse Bladder cells** dataset is referenced by Xiaoping Han et al. (2018). I will compile the citations for each dataset based on the references provided in the paper.

The full citations for the datasets are:

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations for further processing.
