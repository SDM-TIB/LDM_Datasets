To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Modeling Polypharmacy Side Effects with Graph Convolutional Networks" by Marinka Zitnik et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** to get an overview of the study's focus and any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors present Decagon, an approach for modeling polypharmacy side effects, which suggests that datasets related to drug interactions and side effects are likely involved.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for any specific mentions of datasets. The introduction discusses the challenges of polypharmacy and the need for data-driven approaches, but I will look for explicit names of datasets.

I will then focus on **section 2 (Datasets)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used in their study. This section is crucial as it outlines the specific datasets and their characteristics:

1. **Human Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) Network**: Compiled by Menche et al. (2015) and Chatr-Aryamontri et al. (2015), this dataset contains 19,085 proteins and 719,402 physical interactions. The citation is:
   > Menche, J., et al. (2015). Uncovering disease-disease relationships through the incomplete interactome. *Science*, 347(6224), 1257601.

2. **STITCH Database**: This dataset includes over 8,083,600 interactions between 8,934 proteins and 519,022 chemicals. The citation is:
   > Szklarczyk, D., et al. (2015). STITCH 5: augmenting protein–chemical interaction networks with tissue and affinity data. *Nucleic Acids Research*, 44(D1), D380–D384.

3. **SIDER Database**: Contains 286,399 drug-side effect associations over 1,556 drugs and 5,868 side effects. The citation is:
   > Kuhn, M., et al. (2015). The SIDER database of drugs and side effects. *Nucleic Acids Research*, 44(D1), D1075–D1079.

4. **OFFSIDES Database**: Details off-label associations between 1,332 drugs and 10,097 side effects, with a citation:
   > Tatonetti, N. P., et al. (2012). Data-driven prediction of drug effects and interactions. *Science Translational Medicine*, 4(125), 12531.

5. **TWOSIDES Database**: Contains 1,318 side effect types across 63,473 drug combinations. The citation is:
   > Tatonetti, N. P., et al. (2012). Data-driven prediction of drug effects and interactions. *Science Translational Medicine*, 4(125), 12531.

After identifying these datasets, I will ensure to note any additional details provided in the paper, such as the number of interactions or specific characteristics that may be relevant for understanding the datasets' context.

Finally, I will compile the full citations for each dataset, ensuring they are formatted correctly and ready for inclusion in any further analysis or documentation.

With this structured approach, I will ensure that I accurately extract and cite all relevant datasets from the paper.
