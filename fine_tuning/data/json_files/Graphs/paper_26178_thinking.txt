To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Graph Neural Networks for Small Graph and Giant Network Representation Learning: An Overview" by Jiawei Zhang, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections that discuss specific models and experiments**. The abstract provides a general overview, but I will focus on sections that explicitly mention datasets.

In the **introduction**, the author discusses various graph neural network models but does not specify datasets. I will continue to the sections that detail the models and their applications.

Next, I will examine **sections 2 and 3**, which describe the models for small graphs and giant networks, respectively. Here, I will look for any references to datasets used for training or evaluation.

In **section 2.3 (LF&ER: Deep Autoencoder based Latent Feature Extraction)**, the author mentions using community real-estate POI graphs for latent feature extraction. This indicates a dataset related to Points of Interest (POIs) in real estate.

In **section 3.1 (GCN: Graph Convolutional Network)**, the author references the use of the Cora dataset, which is a well-known citation network dataset used for node classification tasks.

In **section 3.2 (GAT: Graph Attention Network)**, while discussing the model, the author does not specify a dataset but mentions that GAT can be applied to various datasets, including citation networks.

In **section 3.3 (DifNN: Deep Diffusive Neural Network)**, the author discusses a heterogeneous social network example but does not provide a specific dataset name.

In **section 3.4 (GNL: Graph Neural Lasso)**, the author mentions using historical time-series data from dynamic networks but does not specify a dataset.

In **section 3.5 (GraphSage)**, the author discusses sampling strategies but does not mention specific datasets.

In **section 3.6 (seGEN)**, the author describes the sampling of sub-graphs but does not provide specific dataset names.

After reviewing the relevant sections, I will compile the datasets identified:

1. **Community Real-Estate POI Graphs**: This dataset is used in the LF&ER model for latent feature extraction.
   - Citation: Wang, P., Zhang, J., Liu, G., Fu, Y., & Aggarwal, C. (2018). Ensemble-Spotting: Ranking Urban Vibrancy via POI Embedding with Multi-view Spatial Graphs. In Proceedings of the 2018 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM), pages 351â€“359.

2. **Cora Dataset**: A citation network dataset used for node classification tasks in the GCN model.
   - Citation: Kipf, T. N., & Welling, M. (2016). Semi-supervised classification with graph convolutional networks. CoRR, abs/1609.02907.

Now, I will ensure that I have accurately captured the details of each dataset and their respective citations. This will allow me to present a clear and comprehensive summary of the datasets referenced in the paper.
