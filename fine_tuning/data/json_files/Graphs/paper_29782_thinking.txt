To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks for Software Effort Estimation" by Hung Phan and Ali Jannesari, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions a tool called HeteroSP for estimating story points from software issues, which suggests that there may be datasets related to software issues.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors discuss the importance of story point estimation in Agile software development. They reference prior works and datasets, specifically mentioning the **Deep-SE dataset** proposed by Choetkiertikul et al. [8]. This indicates that the Deep-SE dataset is relevant to their research.

In the **analysis section**, the authors provide details about the Deep-SE dataset, stating that it consists of 23,313 issues collected from 16 software projects available in the Jira system. This section includes a table summarizing the dataset, which confirms its significance in their study.

I will also check the **results and discussion sections** to see if any additional datasets are mentioned or if there are any comparisons made with other datasets. However, the primary focus remains on the Deep-SE dataset.

Finally, I will look at the **references section** to find the full citation for the Deep-SE dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:
> Morakot Choetkiertikul, Hoa Khanh Dam, Truyen Tran, Trang Pham, Aditya Ghose, and Tim Menzies. *A deep learning model for estimating story points*. CoRR abs/1609.00489 (2016). arXiv:1609.00489.

Now, I will compile the information about the dataset into a structured format, ensuring to include the full citation as it is crucial for proper attribution.
