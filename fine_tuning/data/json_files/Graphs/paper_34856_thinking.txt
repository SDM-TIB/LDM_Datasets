To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Spectral Brain Graph Neural Network for Prediction of Anxiety in Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder" by Peiyu Duan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study involves predicting the MASC-2 score using fMRI data from children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). This suggests that there may be a dataset related to fMRI scans and associated clinical measures.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (specifically section 3) where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention that they conducted experiments on **70 ASD children** and **26 unaffected controls**, which indicates that there is a dataset that includes fMRI scans and clinical evaluations for these subjects.

In section 3.1, the authors provide more details about the dataset, including the age range of the participants (8 to 15 years old) and the measures used (MASC-2 scores). They also mention that the imaging was performed using a Siemens MAGNETOM Tim Trio 3 Tesla scanner, which provides context about the data collection process.

Now, I will look for the **full citations** of the datasets mentioned in the **References section**. The paper specifically references the MASC-2 score, which is a standardized tool for measuring anxiety in children. The citation for the MASC-2 is:

- **MASC-2**: 
  > John S. March et al., “The multidimensional anxiety scale for children (masc): Factor structure, reliability, and validity,” Journal of the American Academy of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry, vol. 36, no. 4, 1997.

Additionally, the authors mention that the fMRI data was parcellated using the **Shen-268 atlas**, which is a widely used dataset in neuroimaging studies. The citation for the Shen-268 atlas is:

- **Shen-268 Atlas**: 
  > Xilin Shen et al., “Groupwise whole-brain parcellation from resting-state fmri data for network node identification,” NeuroImage, vol. 82, pp. 403–415, 2013.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the study, along with their authoritative references.
