To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Self-supervised Video Representation Learning by Pace Prediction" by Jiangliu Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction typically outlines the context and significance of the work, which may include references to datasets.

In the **experiments section**, specifically **section 4.1 (Datasets and Implementation Details)**, the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention three datasets:

1. **UCF101**: This dataset is described as consisting of 13,320 video samples across 101 action classes. The authors specify that they use training split 1 for pre-training and evaluation.

2. **Kinetics-400 (K-400)**: This is a large dataset with around 306,000 videos across 400 human action classes. The authors indicate that they use the training split for pre-training.

3. **HMDB51**: This dataset contains approximately 7,000 videos across 51 action classes, and the authors mention using training/testing split 1 for evaluation.

Next, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and further exploration of the datasets.

- For **UCF101**, the citation is:
  > Soomro, K., Zamir, A.R., & Shah, M. (2012). *UCF101: A dataset of 101 human actions classes from videos in the wild*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1212.0402.

- For **Kinetics-400**, the citation is:
  > Kay, W., Carreira, J., Simonyan, K., et al. (2017). *The kinetics human action video dataset*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1705.06950.

- For **HMDB51**, the citation is:
  > Kuehne, H., Jhuang, H., Garrote, E., Poggio, T., & Serre, T. (2011). *HMDB: A large video database for human motion recognition*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV).

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations for future use or analysis.
