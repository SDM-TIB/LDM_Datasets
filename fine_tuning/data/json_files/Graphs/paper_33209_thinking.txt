To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MultiCBR: Multi-view Contrastive Learning for Bundle Recommendation" by Yunshan Ma et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on three public datasets: **Youshu**, **NetEase**, and **iFashion**. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for the research and should be documented.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In the introduction, the authors state that they conducted extensive experiments on three public benchmark datasets, which confirms the importance of these datasets in their research.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide a brief overview of the datasets used. They mention that the datasets correspond to different scenarios: Youshu for book lists, NetEase for music lists, and iFashion for fashion outfits. This contextual information is valuable for understanding the application of each dataset.

Now, I will check the **dataset statistics** provided in Table 1 of the paper. This table includes the number of users, items, bundles, and interactions for each dataset, which is essential for a comprehensive understanding of the datasets' characteristics.

Next, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The authors reference the datasets as follows:

- **Youshu Dataset**: The citation is:
  > Youshu Dataset. (2022). *Personalized Bundle List Recommendation*. In WWW. ACM, 60–71.

- **NetEase Dataset**: The citation is:
  > NetEase Dataset. (2021). *Bundle Recommendation and Generation with Graph Neural Networks*. IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering.

- **iFashion Dataset**: The citation is:
  > iFashion Dataset. (2019). *POG: Personalized Outfit Generation for Fashion Recommendation at Alibaba iFashion*. In KDD. ACM, 2662–2670.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations as required.

Finally, I will prepare the structured output for each dataset, ensuring that all relevant details are included for future reference or analysis.
