To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Impact-Oriented Contextual Scholar Profiling using Self-Citation Graphs" by Yuankai Luo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions the development of a framework called GeneticFlow (GF) and indicates that evaluations were conducted on real-world academic data sources. This suggests that there are datasets involved, but I need to look for specific names and details.

Next, I will look into the **related work** and **contextual scholar profiling** sections, as these often provide insights into the datasets used for experiments. In section 4.1, the authors mention using "big scholar data from MAG" and "ARC" for their profiling method. This is a clear indication that these are the datasets utilized in their research.

In section 4.1, the authors provide specific details about the datasets:
1. **Microsoft Academic Graph (MAG)**: This dataset covers 237 million papers, 240 million authors, and 1.6 billion citations. It is described as the largest open academic data source.
2. **ACL Anthology Reference Corpus (ARC)**: This dataset is mentioned as a smaller but detailed source that includes metadata and full-text downloads of NLP papers, which is used to augment citation context.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **Microsoft Academic Graph (MAG)**, the citation is:
  > Microsoft Academic Graph. 2020. *Microsoft Academic Graph*. https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/microsoft-academic-graph/.

- For **ACL Anthology Reference Corpus (ARC)**, the citation is:
  > The ACL Anthology Reference Corpus. 2021. *The ACL Anthology Reference Corpus*. https://aclanthology.org/.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets in a structured manner, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured output that is ready for review or further processing, ensuring that all necessary details are included for each dataset mentioned in the paper.
