To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SkipGNN: Predicting Molecular Interactions with Skip-Graph Networks" by Kexin Huang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to locate any references to datasets. In the abstract, the authors mention evaluating their method on four interaction networks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 3.1.1 (Molecular interaction networks)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. They mention four datasets:

1. **BIOSNAP-DTI**: This dataset contains 15,139 drug-target interactions involving 5,018 drugs and 2,325 proteins.

2. **BIOSNAP-DDI**: This dataset consists of 48,514 drug-drug interactions among 1,514 drugs.

3. **HuRI-PPI**: This is the human reference protein-protein interaction network with 5,604 proteins and 23,322 interactions.

4. **DisGeNET-GDI**: This dataset includes 81,746 gene-disease interactions involving 9,413 genes and 10,370 diseases.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **BIOSNAP-DTI**:
  > Zitnik, M., Sosić, R., Maheshwari, S., & Leskovec, J. (2018). BioSNAP Datasets: Stanford biomedical network dataset collection.

- For **BIOSNAP-DDI**:
  > Zitnik, M., Sosić, R., Maheshwari, S., & Leskovec, J. (2018). BioSNAP Datasets: Stanford biomedical network dataset collection.

- For **HuRI-PPI**:
  > Luck, K. et al. (2020). A reference map of the human binary protein interactome. Nature.

- For **DisGeNET-GDI**:
  > Piñero, J. et al. (2019). The DisGeNET knowledge platform for disease genomics: 2019 update. Nucleic Acids Research.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use.

In summary, the datasets extracted from the paper are:
1. BIOSNAP-DTI
2. BIOSNAP-DDI
3. HuRI-PPI
4. DisGeNET-GDI

Each dataset has been documented with its respective citation, ensuring that all necessary information is captured for future reference.
