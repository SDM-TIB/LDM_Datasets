To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning to Anticipate Egocentric Actions by Imagination" by Yu Wu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on two large-scale egocentric action datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this case, they mention two datasets: **EPIC-Kitchens** and **EGTEA Gaze+**. I will look for detailed descriptions of these datasets, including their characteristics, sizes, and any relevant annotations.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide a description of the **EPIC-Kitchens dataset**, stating that it consists of 55 hours of recordings capturing daily activities in kitchens, with 39,596 action annotations. They also mention the **EGTEA Gaze+ dataset**, which contains 19 verbs, 51 nouns, and 106 unique actions. This information is crucial for understanding the datasets' scope and application.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **EPIC-Kitchens**, the citation is:
  > Damen, D., Doughty, H., Farinella, G. M., Fidler, S., Furnari, A., Kazakos, E., Moltisanti, D., Munro, J., Perrett, T., Price, W., & Wray, M. (2018). *Scaling egocentric vision: The EPIC-Kitchens dataset*. In Proceedings of the European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV).

- For **EGTEA Gaze+**, the citation is:
  > Furnari, A., Battiato, S., & Farinella, G. M. (2018). *Leveraging uncertainty to rethink loss functions and evaluation measures for egocentric action anticipation*. In Proceedings of the European Conference on Computer Vision Workshops (ECCV-W).

With this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described accurately and includes the full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details and that the citations are correctly formatted for future reference.
