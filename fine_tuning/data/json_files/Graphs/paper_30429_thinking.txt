To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Topics in Deep Learning and Optimization Algorithms for IoT Applications in Smart Transportation" by Hongde Wu, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the text, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction typically outlines the context and objectives, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will focus on **section 3.4 (Experimental Datasets)**, where the author lists specific datasets used in the experiments. Here, I will find the following datasets:

1. **Dublinbike Dataset**: This dataset is described as a bike-sharing scheme in Dublin City, Ireland, with real-time data accessible via an API. The dataset includes historical data recorded every five minutes, which contains timestamps, station states, number of available bikes, and station locations. The specific time frame used for the study is from 01/07/2020 to 01/10/2020.

2. **NYC-Bikes Dataset**: This dataset includes daily bike orders from the NYC Citi bike-sharing scheme, covering the period from April 1st, 2016 to June 30th, 2016. It contains information such as bike pickup and drop-off stations, pickup and drop-off times, and trip durations.

3. **Visualcrossing Weather Data**: This dataset provides weather conditions at various locations over different historical time points, including temperature, humidity, and wind speed. It is integrated with the Dublinbike dataset for the experiments.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to retrieve the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For the **Dublinbike Dataset**, the citation is:
> DublinBikes. *DublinBikes Dataset*. Available at: https://data.smartdublin.ie/dataset/analyze/33ec9fe2-4957-4e9a-ab55-c5e917c7a9ab.

For the **NYC-Bikes Dataset**, the citation is:
> NYC Citi Bike. *NYC Citi Bike Dataset*. Available at: https://www.citibikenyc.com/data.

For the **Visualcrossing Weather Data**, the citation is:
> Visual Crossing. *Visualcrossing Weather Data*. Available at: https://www.visualcrossing.com/weather-data.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant datasets from the paper.
