To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Uniform Clusters on Hypersphere for Deep Graph-Level Clustering" by Mengling Hu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the empirical study is conducted on "eight well-known datasets," which indicates that datasets are indeed present in the paper. I will look for specific names or descriptions of these datasets.

Next, I will examine the **methodology** section, particularly the **experiments** subsection, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this case, the authors mention conducting experiments on five kinds of datasets from TUDatasets, specifically listing:

1. **MUTAG**: A dataset for small molecules.
2. **DD**: A bioinformatics dataset.
3. **COIL-DEL**: A dataset from computer vision.
4. **IMDB-BINARY**: A social networks dataset.
5. **REDDIT-BINARY**: Another social networks dataset.
6. **REDDIT-MULTI-12K**: A larger social networks dataset.
7. **COLORS-3**: A synthetic dataset.
8. **Synthie**: Another synthetic dataset.

I will ensure to note the context in which these datasets are mentioned, particularly focusing on their relevance to the experiments conducted.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The paper mentions that the datasets are sourced from TUDatasets, so I will look for the citation related to TUDatasets, which is likely to provide the necessary details for each dataset.

The citation for TUDatasets is:
> Christopher Morris, Nils M Kriege, Franka Bause, Kristian Kersting, Petra Mutzel, and Marion Neumann. *TUDataset: A collection of benchmark datasets for learning with graphs*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2007.08663, 2020.

Now, I will compile the dataset information along with their citations into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described with its corresponding citation.

In summary, I will extract the datasets by:
1. Reading the abstract and introduction for initial mentions.
2. Reviewing the methodology section for detailed descriptions of the datasets.
3. Consulting the references for full citations, particularly focusing on TUDatasets for the datasets listed.
4. Compiling the information into a structured format for clarity and completeness.
