To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fake News Detection on Social Media using Geometric Deep Learning" by Federico Monti et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and dataset sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the model was trained and tested on news stories verified by professional fact-checking organizations, which suggests that there is a dataset involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Dataset)**, where the authors describe their data collection process. They mention that they collected a dataset consisting of **1,084 labeled claims** spread on Twitter, covering **158,951 cascades** from May 2013 to January 2018. This section provides a clear overview of the dataset's size and the time frame it covers.

The authors also detail their data collection protocol, which involved using news verified by fact-checking organizations such as **Snopes**, **PolitiFact**, and **Buzzfeed**. This indicates that the dataset is based on claims that have been individually verified, which adds credibility to the dataset.

In terms of statistics, the paper states that the dataset includes **1,129 URLs** and mentions the average number of tweets and users involved in the cascades. This information is crucial for understanding the dataset's structure and scope.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find full citations for the fact-checking organizations mentioned. The citations for these organizations are as follows:

- **Snopes**: 
  > Snopes. *Fact-Checking Website*. Available at: https://www.snopes.com/

- **PolitiFact**: 
  > PolitiFact. *Fact-Checking Website*. Available at: https://www.politifact.com/

- **Buzzfeed**: 
  > Buzzfeed. *Fact-Checking Website*. Available at: https://www.buzzfeed.com/

These references provide the necessary citations for the sources of the dataset.

Finally, I will compile the extracted information into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and full citations for each dataset. This will ensure that all relevant details are captured and properly attributed.
