To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Enhancing Relational Rules for Knowledge Graph Link Prediction" by Shuhan Wu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. In the abstract, the authors mention that their experimental results are based on "multiple datasets," which indicates that there are specific datasets used for their experiments. I will look for any specific names or descriptions of these datasets.

Next, I will proceed to the **experiments section** (section 4), where the authors typically provide detailed information about the datasets used. In this section, they explicitly mention four datasets: **WN18RR**, **FB15k-237**, **NELL-995**, and **YAGO3-10**. I will take note of the context in which these datasets are used, including any relevant statistics or characteristics that may be important for understanding their application in the research.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

1. **WN18RR**: 
   > Dettmers, T., Minervini, P., Stenetorp, P., & Riedel, S. (2018). Convolutional 2D knowledge graph embeddings. In Proceedings of the Thirty-Second AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Thirtieth Innovative Applications of Artificial Intelligence Conference and Eighth AAAI Symposium on Educational Advances in Artificial Intelligence, AAAI’18/IAAI’18/EAAI’18. AAAI Press.

2. **FB15k-237**: 
   > Toutanova, K., & Chen, D. (2015). Observed versus latent features for knowledge base and text inference. In Proceedings of the 3rd Workshop on Continuous Vector Space Models and their Compositionality, pages 57–66, Beijing, China. Association for Computational Linguistics.

3. **NELL-995**: 
   > Xiong, W., Hoang, T., & Wang, W. (2017). DeepPath: A reinforcement learning method for knowledge graph reasoning. In Proceedings of the 2017 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 564–573, Copenhagen, Denmark. Association for Computational Linguistics.

4. **YAGO3-10**: 
   > Chami, I., Wolf, A., Juan, D.-C., Sala, F., Ravi, S., & Ré, C. (2020). Low-dimensional hyperbolic knowledge graph embeddings. In Proceedings of the 58th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, pages 6901–6914.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset, its description, and its citation. This will ensure that the datasets are properly documented and can be referenced in future work.
