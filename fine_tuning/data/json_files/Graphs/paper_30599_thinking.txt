To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MONAI: An open-source framework for deep learning in healthcare" by M. Jorge Cardoso et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract discusses the MONAI framework's applications in healthcare, but I need to look for specific datasets used in experiments or evaluations.

Next, I will examine the **Methods section**, particularly the subsections that discuss datasets and data representations. In section 2.7 (Datasets and IO), the authors mention several datasets, including:

1. **MedNIST**: This dataset serves as an analogue to the MNIST dataset for medical imaging, providing a standard dataset for initial training and benchmarking of various medically-focused deep learning applications.

2. **Medical Segmentation Decathlon**: This represents a set of 10 challenge datasets widely used to demonstrate network performance across a range of segmentation tasks.

Additionally, the authors mention the **TciaDataset**, which is designed to automatically download and extract publicly-accessible datasets from The Cancer Imaging Archive, including accompanying DICOM segmentations.

After identifying these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **MedNIST**, the citation is:
  > Erickson, B. J., et al. *MedNIST: A Dataset for Medical Imaging Classification*. Available at: https://github.com/MedNIST/MedNIST.

- For **Medical Segmentation Decathlon**, the citation is:
  > Antonelli, M., et al. *The Medical Segmentation Decathlon*. Available at: https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.05735.

- For **TciaDataset**, the citation is:
  > The Cancer Imaging Archive. *The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA)*. Available at: https://www.cancerimagingarchive.net/.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets mentioned in the paper along with their full citations.
