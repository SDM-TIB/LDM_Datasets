To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Quantifying the effect of X-ray scattering for data generation in real-time defect detection" by Vladyslav Andriiashen et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or data generation methods.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of collecting labeled data for X-ray defect detection and mention that various methods of X-ray image generation can be considered. This suggests that there may be datasets generated or used in the study.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly where the authors describe their data generation process. They mention using a Monte-Carlo simulation algorithm (specifically GATE) to produce two versions of training data: one including scattering and one excluding it. This indicates that the datasets are generated through simulation rather than being sourced from existing datasets.

The authors specify that they generated **1250 objects for the training set** (1000 for training and 250 for validation) and **1000 objects for the test set**. They describe the geometrical properties of the objects, including variations in radius and height, and the types of materials used (PMMA, aluminum, and iron). This detailed description is crucial for understanding the datasets.

In the **results section**, the authors present findings based on the datasets generated, including the performance of deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) trained on these datasets. They also provide specific values for the smallest detectable defects (s90) for different materials and voltages, which further confirms the datasets' relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find any citations related to the datasets or the simulation tools used. The authors reference GATE (Jan et al., 2011) for the Monte-Carlo simulation, which is essential for understanding the methodology behind the dataset generation.

The full citations for the datasets and tools mentioned in the paper are:

1. **GATE (Monte-Carlo simulation tool)**:

2. **Data Generation Methodology**:

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets in a structured format, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset and tool used in the research.
