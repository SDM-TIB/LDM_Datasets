To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Label-GCN: An Effective Method for Adding Label Propagation to Graph Convolutional Networks" by Claudio Bellei et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, but the details about datasets are likely to be found in the experiments section.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, specifically **subsection 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention four datasets: **Cora**, **CiteSeer**, **PubMed**, and **Elliptic**. I will take note of the details provided for each dataset, including their characteristics such as the number of nodes, edges, classes, features, and the training/validation/test splits.

For each dataset, I will summarize the key information:

1. **Cora**: A citation network with 2,708 nodes, 5,429 edges, 7 classes, and 1,433 features. The dataset is split into training, validation, and test sets with specific counts.

2. **CiteSeer**: Another citation network with 3,312 nodes, 4,715 edges, 6 classes, and 3,703 features, also with defined splits.

3. **PubMed**: A citation network with 19,717 nodes, 44,338 edges, 3 classes, and 500 features, along with its splits.

4. **Elliptic**: A Bitcoin transaction graph with 203,769 nodes, 234,355 edges, 2 classes, and 166 features, with its own splits.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The citations I will extract are:

- For **Cora**: 
  > Sen, P., Namata, G., Bilgic, M., Getoor, L., Gallagher, B., & Eliassi-Rad, T. (2008). Collective classification in network data. *AI magazine*, 29(3), 93-93.

- For **CiteSeer**: 
  > L. Getoor and B. Taskar. (2007). Introduction to Statistical Relational Learning. *MIT Press*.

- For **PubMed**: 
  > Namata, G., London, B., Getoor, L., Huang, B., & Edu, U. (2012). Query-driven active surveying for collective classification. In *10th International Workshop on Mining and Learning with Graphs*.

- For **Elliptic**: 
  > Elliptic. (2019). Elliptic Data Set. Retrieved from https://www.kaggle.com/ellipticco/elliptic-data-set.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
