To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning visual explanations for DCNN-based image classifiers using an attention mechanism" by Ioanna Gkartzonika et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experimental evaluations on **ImageNet**, which suggests that this dataset is crucial to their work.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Dataset)**, where the authors explicitly mention the dataset used for their experiments. They state that they used **ImageNet**, which is a well-known dataset in the field of visual XAI. The authors describe it as containing **1.3 million images for training and 50,000 images for testing**, with **1,000 classes**.

To ensure I have the correct citation for the dataset, I will check the **References section** of the paper. The citation for the ImageNet dataset is:

- **ImageNet**: 
  > Deng, J., Dong, W., Socher, R., Li, L.J., Li, K., Fei-Fei, L. *ImageNet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In Proceedings of the IEEE CVPR, pages 248â€“255, Miami, FL, USA, June 2009.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the findings:

1. **ImageNet**: A large-scale dataset used for training and testing, containing 1.3 million images for training and 50,000 images for testing, with 1,000 classes.

Finally, I will prepare to compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
