To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Anti-Compression Contrastive Facial Forgery Detection" by Jiajun Huang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the development of a forgery detection model and hints at the use of various datasets, which suggests that I should look for specific dataset names.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention three datasets:

1. **FF++ Dataset**: This dataset consists of 1,000 YouTube videos containing human talking scenes, which were manipulated using a deepfake algorithm to create 1,000 facial forgery videos. 

2. **Celeb-DF Dataset**: This dataset includes 590 YouTube videos that cover various age and gender groups, resulting in 5,639 face-swapping videos.

3. **DeepfakeMnist+ Dataset**: This dataset is a large-scale facial animation video dataset that contains 10,000 real videos collected from VoxCeleb, which were used to generate 10,000 animation videos depicting ten specific actions.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **FF++ Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Andreas Rössler, Davide Cozzolino, Luisa Verdoliva, Christian Riess, Justus Thies, and Matthias Nießner. *FaceForensics++: Learning to detect manipulated facial images*. In International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2019.

- For the **Celeb-DF Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yuezun Li, Pu Sun, Honggang Qi, and Siwei Lyu. *Celeb-DF: A Large-scale Challenging Dataset for DeepFake Forensics*. In IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), Seattle, WA, United States, 2020.

- For the **DeepfakeMnist+ Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Jiajun Huang, Xueyu Wang, Bo Du, Pei Du, and Chang Xu. *Deepfake mnist+: A deepfake facial animation dataset*. 2021.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or processing.
