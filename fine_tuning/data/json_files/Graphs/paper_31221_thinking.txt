To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Data-Efficient Contrastive Self-supervised Learning: Most Beneficial Examples for Supervised Learning Contribute the Least" by Siddharth Joshi and Baharan Mirzasoleiman, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on several datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors mention using **CIFAR10, CIFAR100, STL10, and TinyImageNet** for their experiments. I will note these datasets as they are crucial for understanding the context of the research.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide details about how they applied their method (SAS) to these datasets. They mention that they can safely exclude a certain percentage of examples from each dataset without harming performance, which reinforces the importance of these datasets in their study.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

1. **CIFAR100**:
   > Krizhevsky, A., & Hinton, G. (2009). *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. Technical Report 0, University of Toronto.

2. **STL10**:
   > Coates, A., Ng, A. Y., & Lee, H. (2011). *An analysis of single-layer networks in unsupervised feature learning*. In Proceedings of the Fourteenth International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics (pp. 215-223). JMLR Workshop and Conference Proceedings.

3. **TinyImageNet**:
   > Le, Y., & Yang, X. S. (2015). *Tiny ImageNet Visual Recognition Challenge*. 

4. **CIFAR10**:
   > Krizhevsky, A., & Hinton, G. (2009). *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. Technical Report 0, University of Toronto.

With these citations in hand, I will compile the dataset information, ensuring that I include the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations as required.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for further processing or review.
