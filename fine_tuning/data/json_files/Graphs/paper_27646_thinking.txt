To extract datasets from the research paper titled "WGCN: Graph Convolutional Networks with Weighted Structural Features" by Yunxiang Zhao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluated their method on five benchmark datasets, which indicates that datasets are present.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention:

1. **Cora-ML Dataset**: A directed citation graph with 2,995 nodes, 4,320 edges, and 7 classes. It includes bag-of-words feature vectors for each article.
2. **CiteSeer Dataset**: Another directed citation graph with 3,327 nodes, 4,732 edges, and 6 classes, also featuring bag-of-words content.
3. **Chameleon Dataset**: A directed Wikipedia page link graph with 2,277 nodes and 36,101 edges, containing 5 classes but no bag-of-words features.
4. **Squirrel Dataset**: A directed Wikipedia page link graph with 5,201 nodes and 217,073 edges, also with 5 classes and no bag-of-words features.
5. **Crocodile Dataset**: Another directed Wikipedia page link graph with 11,631 nodes and 180,021 edges, featuring 5 classes and no bag-of-words features.

In the **experiments section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for transductive node classification tasks, which further validates their relevance.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **Cora-ML Dataset**:
  > Bojchevski, A., & Günnemann, S. (2018). Deep Gaussian Embedding of Graphs: Unsupervised Inductive Learning via Ranking. In ICLR.

- For **CiteSeer Dataset**:
  > Bojchevski, A., & Günnemann, S. (2018). Deep Gaussian Embedding of Graphs: Unsupervised Inductive Learning via Ranking. In ICLR.

- For **Chameleon Dataset**:
  > Karypis, G., & Han, E. (2000). A Fast and High Quality Multilevel Scheme for Partitioning Irregular Graphs. In SIAM Journal on Scientific Computing, 24(1), 219-235.

- For **Squirrel Dataset**:
  > Karypis, G., & Han, E. (2000). A Fast and High Quality Multilevel Scheme for Partitioning Irregular Graphs. In SIAM Journal on Scientific Computing, 24(1), 219-235.

- For **Crocodile Dataset**:
  > Karypis, G., & Han, E. (2000). A Fast and High Quality Multilevel Scheme for Partitioning Irregular Graphs. In SIAM Journal on Scientific Computing, 24(1), 219-235.

With this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes its full citation. This structured approach will help in organizing the datasets for further analysis or processing.
