To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Computed Tomography Vertebral Segmentation Dataset with Anatomical Variations and Multi-Vendor Scanner Data" by Hans Liebl et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the paper discusses the "VerSe 2020 dataset," which is a strong indication that this dataset is central to the research.

Next, I will look for specific sections that detail the datasets used. In this case, the **Methods** section provides a comprehensive overview of the dataset's composition, including the number of subjects, the types of anatomical variations included, and the imaging techniques used. I will pay close attention to any specific mentions of the dataset's name, its characteristics, and how it was constructed.

In the **Data Records** section, the authors describe the **VerSe 2020 dataset** in detail, noting that it comprises 319 CT image series from 300 subjects, with a total of 4142 annotated vertebrae. This section also highlights the inclusion of anatomical variants and the dataset's availability under a Creative Commons license.

I will also check the **References** section to find the full citation for the **VerSe 2020 dataset**. The authors reference the dataset's previous iteration, **VerSe 2019**, and provide a link to the dataset's repository. 

The full citation for the **VerSe 2020 dataset** is:
> Sekuboyina, A., Kukačka, J., Kirschke, J. S., Menze, B. H., & Valentinitsch, A. (2020). Verse: a vertebrae labelling and segmentation benchmark. arXiv preprint arXiv:2001.09193.

Additionally, the authors mention the **VerSe 2019 dataset**, which is also relevant:
> Sekuboyina, A., Valentinitsch, A., Kirschke, J., & Menze, B. (2019). A Localisation-Segmentation Approach for Multi-label Annotation of Lumbar Vertebrae using Deep Nets. ArXiv abs/1703.04347.

Now, I will compile the extracted information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and that the full citations are included. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets referenced in the paper, ready for further processing or review.
