To extract datasets from the research paper titled "GANExplainer: GAN-based Graph Neural Networks Explainer" by Yiqiao Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the empirical results on synthetic datasets, which suggests that datasets are indeed involved.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section. Here, the authors discuss the importance of explainability in graph neural networks (GNNs) and mention various explainers, but I need to look for specific datasets used in their experiments.

I will then focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used in their experiments. They mention two synthetic datasets and two real-world datasets:

1. **BA-Shapes**: This dataset is based on a Barabasi-Albert graph with 300 nodes and includes 80 "house"-structured network motifs. The nodes are categorized into four classes based on their structural roles.

2. **Tree-Cycles**: This dataset starts with a balanced binary tree and attaches cycle motifs. Nodes are divided into two classes based on their structural roles.

3. **Mutagenicity**: This dataset consists of 4,337 molecule graphs, where nodes represent atoms and edges represent chemical bonds. The classes indicate whether the molecules are mutagenic or non-mutagenic.

4. **NCI1**: This dataset contains over 4,000 chemical compounds represented as undirected graphs, with class labels indicating activity against non-small cell lung cancer.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:

- For **BA-Shapes** and **Tree-Cycles**, the authors reference:

- For **Mutagenicity**, the citation is:

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes its full citation. This will prepare the information for structured output or further processing.
