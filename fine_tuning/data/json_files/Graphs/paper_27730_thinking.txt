To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Contrastive Model Inversion for Data-Free Knowledge Distillation" by Gongfan Fang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that experiments were conducted on **CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet**, which suggests these are the datasets used.

Next, I will look into **section 4.1 (Settings)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they confirm that they utilized:

1. **CIFAR-10**: A dataset containing 50,000 training samples and 10,000 test samples, with images of size 32x32 pixels.
2. **CIFAR-100**: Similar to CIFAR-10 but with 100 classes, also containing 50,000 training samples and 10,000 test samples.
3. **Tiny-ImageNet**: A more challenging dataset with 100,000 training images and 10,000 test images, with images of size 64x64 pixels.

To ensure I have the correct citations, I will check the **References section** of the paper for the full citations of these datasets:

- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton, et al. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. Technical Report, 2009.

- For **CIFAR-100**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Ilya Sutskever, and Geoffrey Hinton. *Imagenet classification with deep convolutional neural networks*. NeurIPS, 2012.

- For **Tiny-ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Ya Le and Xuan Yang. *Tiny imagenet visual recognition challenge*. Technical Report, 2015.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
