To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Application of artificial intelligence techniques for automated detection of myocardial infarction: A review" by Javad Hassannataj Joloudari et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract highlights the use of artificial intelligence for diagnosing myocardial infarction (MI) using ECG signals, which suggests that datasets related to ECG might be present.

Next, I will focus on the **section discussing public ECG datasets for MI**. This section explicitly mentions two significant datasets:

1. **PTB Diagnostic ECG Dataset**: This dataset has been publicly available for over 20 years and is frequently used in MI research. It contains annotated ECG signals for various cardiological conditions, including myocardial infarction.

2. **PTB-XL Dataset**: Released in 2020, this is one of the largest ECG datasets, comprising 21,837 10-second 12-lead ECG records from 18,885 patients. It includes data from 148 MI patients and 52 healthy subjects, making it suitable for training MI diagnosis models.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **PTB Diagnostic ECG Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Goldberger, A. L., Amaral, L. A., Glass, L., Hausdorff, J. M., Ivanov, P. C., Mark, R. G., Mietus, J. E., Moody, G. B., Peng, C.-K., & Stanley, H. E. (2000). PhysioBank, PhysioToolkit, and PhysioNet: components of a new research resource for complex physiologic signals. *Circulation*, 101(23), e215-e220.

- For the **PTB-XL Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Wagner, P., Strodthoff, N., Bousseljot, R.-D., Kreiseler, D., Lunze, F. I., Samek, W., & Schaeffter, T. (2020). PTB-XL, a large publicly available electrocardiography dataset. *Scientific Data*, 7, 1-15.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the context of myocardial infarction diagnosis.
