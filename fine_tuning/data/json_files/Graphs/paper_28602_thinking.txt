To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Contrast-reconstruction Representation Learning for Self-supervised Skeleton-based Action Recognition" by Peng Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on several benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors describe their methodology and results. In this section, they mention using five benchmark datasets for their experiments: **NTU RGB+D 60, NTU RGB+D 120, PKU-MMD, CMU, and NW-UCLA**. I will take note of these datasets and look for specific details about each one.

For each dataset, I will extract the following information:
1. **Dataset Name**: The name of the dataset as mentioned in the paper.
2. **Description**: A brief description of the dataset, including the number of samples, types of actions, and any relevant characteristics.
3. **Full Citation**: The complete citation for each dataset, which is crucial for proper attribution.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset from the **References section** of the paper. Here are the citations I will look for:

1. **NTU RGB+D 60 Dataset**: The citation is:
   > A. Shahroudy, J. Liu, T.-T. Ng, and G. Wang. "NTU RGB+D: A large scale dataset for 3D human activity analysis." In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2016, pp. 1010–1019.

2. **NTU RGB+D 120 Dataset**: The citation is:
   > J. Liu, A. Shahroudy, M. Perez, G. Wang, L.-Y. Duan, and A. C. Kot. "NTU RGB+D 120: A large-scale benchmark for 3D human activity understanding." IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, vol. 42, no. 10, pp. 2684–2701, 2019.

3. **PKU Multi-Modality Dataset (PKU-MMD)**: The citation is:
   > J. Liu, S. Song, C. Liu, Y. Li, and Y. Hu. "A benchmark dataset and comparison study for multi-modal human action analytics." ACM Transactions on Multimedia Computing, Communications, and Applications, vol. 16, pp. 1–24, 2020.

4. **CMU Dataset**: The citation is:
   > CMU. "CMU Graphics Lab Motion Capture Database." http://mocap.cs.cmu.edu, 2003.

5. **NW-UCLA Dataset**: The citation is:
   > J. Wang, X. Nie, Y. Xia, Y. Wu, and S.-C. Zhu. "Cross-view action modeling, learning and recognition." In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2014, pp. 2649–2656.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, which is essential for reproducibility and further research.
