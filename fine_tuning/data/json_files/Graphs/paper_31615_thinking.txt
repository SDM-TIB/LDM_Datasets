To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Triple Sequence Learning for Cross-domain Recommendation" by Haokai Ma et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for experiments. The introduction often elaborates on the problem being addressed and may reference datasets that are critical to the study.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **experiments** within the paper. This section typically contains detailed descriptions of the datasets used, including their characteristics, sizes, and any preprocessing steps taken. In this paper, I will specifically look for mentions of datasets in the **experiments section** where the authors discuss their methodology and results.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention using datasets from **Amazon** and **Douban** for their experiments. They provide statistics for these datasets, which include user counts, item counts, and records, indicating the datasets' relevance and scale.

Now, I will extract the specific datasets mentioned:

1. **Amazon Toy & Game Dataset**: This dataset includes user interactions related to toys and games, with specific statistics provided in the paper.
2. **Amazon Book & Movie Dataset**: This dataset contains user interactions for books and movies, also detailed in the paper.
3. **Douban Book & Music Dataset**: This dataset includes user interactions for books and music, with statistics provided.

Next, I will consult the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations typically include the authors, title, publication venue, and year, which are essential for proper attribution.

For the datasets mentioned, I will compile the following citations:

- For the **Amazon datasets**, I will reference the original source of the dataset, which is often a publicly available dataset or a specific research paper that introduced it.
- For the **Douban dataset**, I will similarly find the original source or publication that describes the dataset.

After gathering all necessary information, I will ensure that I have the full citations formatted correctly for each dataset. This will include the authors, title, publication details, and any relevant URLs if the datasets are available online.

Finally, I will summarize the extracted datasets and their citations in a clear format, ensuring that all information is accurate and complete for future reference or use in related research.
