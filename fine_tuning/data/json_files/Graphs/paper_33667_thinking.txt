To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Enhancing Adversarial Contrastive Learning via Adversarial Invariant Regularization" by Xilie Xu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for evaluation. In the introduction, the authors often discuss the context of their work, which may include references to specific datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments in detail. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics. The authors mention conducting experiments on various datasets, including **CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, STL-10, CIFAR-10-C, and CIFAR-100-C**. 

I will then check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. For example, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 are well-known datasets, and their citations are typically included in the references. I will ensure to note down the complete citation details for each dataset mentioned in the paper.

The citations I will look for include:

- **CIFAR-10**: 
  > Alex Krizhevsky. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical report, 2009.

- **CIFAR-100**: 
  > Alex Krizhevsky. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical report, 2009.

- **STL-10**: 
  > Adam Coates, Andrew Ng, and Honglak Lee. *An Analysis of Single-Layer Networks in Unsupervised Feature Learning*. In Proceedings of the Fourteenth International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics, pages 215â€“223, 2011.

- **CIFAR-10-C** and **CIFAR-100-C**: 
  > Dan Hendrycks and Thomas Dietterich. *Benchmarking Neural Network Robustness to Common Corruptions and Perturbations*. Proceedings of the International Conference on Learning Representations, 2019.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described with its name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details and that the citations are accurate and complete.
