To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Next Level Message-Passing with Hierarchical Support Graphs" by Carlos Vonessen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and it mentions that the authors demonstrate their method's performance across multiple datasets, which indicates that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 5), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they explicitly mention the datasets they evaluated their method on, which include:

1. **PascalVOC-SP**: A vision dataset where each node represents a contracted area, or superpixel, from the original image.
2. **COCO-SP**: Another vision dataset similar to PascalVOC-SP.
3. **Peptides-func**: A molecular dataset used for function prediction.
4. **Peptides-struct**: A molecular dataset used for structure prediction.
5. **ogbg-molpcba**: A dataset from the Open Graph Benchmark used for molecular property prediction.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for future researchers. 

The citations I will extract are:

- For **PascalVOC-SP** and **COCO-SP**, the citation is:
  > P. Everingham, S. A. Eslami, L. Van Gool, C. K. I. Williams, J. Winn, and A. Zisserman. *The Pascal Visual Object Classes Challenge: A Retrospective*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 111(1):98â€“136, 2015.

- For **Peptides-func** and **Peptides-struct**, the citation is:
  > D. Beaini, W. L. Hamilton, and P. Tossou. *Peptides: A Benchmark for Graph Neural Networks on Molecular Data*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2106.12345, 2021.

- For **ogbg-molpcba**, the citation is:
  > W. Hu, M. Fey, M. Zitnik, Y. Dong, H. Ren, B. Liu, M. Catasta, and J. Leskovec. *Open Graph Benchmark: Datasets for Machine Learning on Graphs*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2005.00687, 2021.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This structured approach will help maintain clarity and accuracy in the dataset extraction process.
