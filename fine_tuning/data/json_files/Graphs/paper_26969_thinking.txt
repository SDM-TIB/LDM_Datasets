To extract datasets from the research paper titled "When Contrastive Learning Meets Active Learning: A Novel Graph Active Learning Paradigm with Self-Supervision" by Yanqiao Zhu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors conducted experiments on **five public datasets**, which indicates that there are datasets to extract.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **Datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **Experiments section**. In this paper, the authors provide a table (Table 1) that summarizes the statistics of the datasets used in their experiments. This table includes the following datasets:

1. **Cora**: A citation network dataset with 5,429 nodes, 2,708 edges, 7 classes, and 1,433 features.
2. **Citeseer**: Another citation network dataset with 4,732 nodes, 3,327 edges, 6 classes, and 3,703 features.
3. **Pubmed**: A dataset with 19,717 nodes, 44,338 edges, 3 classes, and 500 features.
4. **Computer**: A larger dataset with 13,752 nodes, 245,861 edges, 10 classes, and 767 features.
5. **Photo**: Another larger dataset with 7,650 nodes, 119,081 edges, 8 classes, and 745 features.

I will also check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. However, since these datasets are commonly used in the field, they may not have specific citations provided in the paper. Instead, I will note that they are publicly available datasets commonly referenced in the literature.

Now, I will compile the information about each dataset, including their names, statistics, and any relevant citations if available. 

Finally, I will ensure that I format the dataset entries clearly, emphasizing the importance of full citations for each dataset, even if they are not explicitly provided in the paper. 

After gathering all the necessary information, I will prepare the dataset entries for further processing or review.
