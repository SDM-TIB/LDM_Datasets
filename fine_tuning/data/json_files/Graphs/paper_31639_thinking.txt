To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CiPR: An Efficient Framework with Cross-instance Positive Relations for Generalized Category Discovery" by Shaozhe Hao et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for evaluation. 

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of generalized category discovery (GCD) and may reference datasets that are commonly used in this field. I will look for specific names of datasets or references to well-known datasets.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. This section often includes details about the datasets, such as the number of classes, the number of images, and any specific splits used for training and testing.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors evaluate their framework on several datasets:

1. **CIFAR-10**: A well-known dataset consisting of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class.
2. **CIFAR-100**: Similar to CIFAR-10 but with 100 classes, each containing 600 images.
3. **ImageNet-100**: A subset of the larger ImageNet dataset, consisting of 100 classes randomly sampled from the full dataset.
4. **CUB-200**: The Caltech-UCSD Birds-200-2011 dataset, which contains 11,788 images of birds across 200 categories.
5. **Stanford Cars**: A dataset containing 16,185 images of 196 classes of cars.
6. **Herbarium19**: A dataset for fine-grained classification of plant species, containing 6,000 images across 196 classes.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for the datasets used in the research.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation for proper documentation and future reference.
