To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-Resolution Graph Neural Network for Large-Scale Pointcloud Segmentation" by Liuyue Xie et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the framework has been validated on benchmark datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be discussed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Results)**, where the authors evaluate their framework. Here, they mention two datasets explicitly:

1. **Stanford Large-Scale 3D Indoor Spaces Dataset (S3DIS)**: This dataset is described as providing a comprehensive collection of indoor pointcloud scans, with over 695 million points across 270 rooms. The authors mention that they used a standard 6-fold cross-validation approach for their experiments.

2. **Virtual KITTI Dataset (vKITTI)**: This dataset contains simulated LiDAR data generated from monocular videos, with 50 annotated videos producing dense pointclouds. The authors note that the dataset includes 13 semantic classes and is separated into 6 non-overlapping sets for testing and training.

To confirm the details and obtain full citations, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper:

- For the **Stanford Large-Scale 3D Indoor Spaces Dataset**, the citation is:
  > I. Armeni, A. Sax, A. R. Zamir, and S. Savarese. *Joint 2D-3D-Semantic Data for Indoor Scene Understanding*. ArXiv e-prints, Feb. 2017.

- For the **Virtual KITTI Dataset**, the citation is:
  > A. Gaidon, Q. Wang, Y. Cabon, and E. Vig. *Virtual worlds as proxy for multi-object tracking analysis*. CoRR, abs/1605.06457, 2016.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will summarize the information for each dataset, ensuring that I include the full citation as required.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
