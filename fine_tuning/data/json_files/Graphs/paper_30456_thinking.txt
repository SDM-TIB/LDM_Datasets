To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Watch the Neighbors: A Unified K-Nearest Neighbor Contrastive Learning Framework for OOD Intent Discovery" by Yutao Mou et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention three datasets:

1. **Banking Dataset**: This dataset contains 13,083 customer service queries with 77 intents in the banking domain. The authors provide specific statistics about the training, validation, and test splits.

2. **HWU64 Dataset**: This dataset includes 25,716 utterances with 64 intents across 21 domains. Similar to the Banking dataset, the authors provide details about the splits.

3. **CLINC Dataset**: This dataset consists of 22,500 queries covering 150 intents across 10 domains. The authors also provide statistics regarding the splits for this dataset.

After identifying the datasets, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

- For the **Banking Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Iñigo Casanueva, Tadas Temčinas, Daniela Gerz, Matthew Henderson, and Ivan Vulić. *Efficient intent detection with dual sentence encoders*. In Proceedings of the 2nd Workshop on Natural Language Processing for Conversational AI, pages 38–45, Online. Association for Computational Linguistics, 2020.

- For the **HWU64 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Xingkun Liu, Arash Eshghi, Pawel Swietojanski, and Verena Rieser. *Benchmarking natural language understanding services for building conversational agents*. In Increasing Naturalness and Flexibility in Spoken Dialogue Interaction, pages 165–183. Springer, 2021.

- For the **CLINC Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Stefan Larson, Anish Mahendran, Joseph J. Peper, Christopher Clarke, Andrew Lee, Parker Hill, Jonathan K. Kummerfeld, Kevin Leach, Michael A. Laurenzano, Lingjia Tang, and Jason Mars. *An evaluation dataset for intent classification and out-of-scope prediction*. In Proceedings of the 2019 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing and the 9th International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing (EMNLP-IJCNLP), pages 1–10, 2019.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
