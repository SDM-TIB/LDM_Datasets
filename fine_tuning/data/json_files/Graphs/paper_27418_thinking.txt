To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Gaussian Scale Mixture Prior for Spectral Compressive Imaging" by Tao Huang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted extensive experiments on both synthetic and real datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments** section. In the provided text, I find that the authors mention two public HSI datasets: **CAVE** and **KAIST**. 

1. **CAVE Dataset**: The authors describe it as consisting of 32 hyperspectral images of spatial size 512 × 512 with 31 spectral bands. This dataset is used for network training.

2. **KAIST Dataset**: This dataset contains 30 hyperspectral images of spatial size 2704 × 3376, also with 31 spectral bands. It is used for testing, specifically with 10 scenes extracted for evaluation.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

- For the **CAVE dataset**, the citation is:
  > Fumihito Yasuma, Tomoo Mitsunaga, Daisuke Iso, and Shree K. Nayar. *Generalized assorted pixel camera: post-capture control of resolution, dynamic range, and spectrum*. IEEE Transactions on Image Processing, 19(9):2241–2253, 2010.

- For the **KAIST dataset**, the citation is:
  > Inchang Choi, Daniel S. Jeon, Giljoo Nam, Diego Gutierrez, and Min H. Kim. *High-quality hyperspectral reconstruction using a spectral prior*. ACM Transactions on Graphics (TOG), 36(6):1–13, 2017.

Having gathered the necessary information about the datasets, I will now summarize the findings:

1. **CAVE Dataset**: 32 hyperspectral images, 512 × 512, 31 spectral bands.
   - Citation: Yasuma, F., Mitsunaga, T., Iso, D., & Nayar, S. K. (2010). Generalized assorted pixel camera: post-capture control of resolution, dynamic range, and spectrum. IEEE Transactions on Image Processing, 19(9), 2241–2253.

2. **KAIST Dataset**: 30 hyperspectral images, 2704 × 3376, 31 spectral bands.
   - Citation: Choi, I., Jeon, D. S., Nam, G., Gutierrez, D., & Kim, M. H. (2017). High-quality hyperspectral reconstruction using a spectral prior. ACM Transactions on Graphics (TOG), 36(6), 1–13.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
