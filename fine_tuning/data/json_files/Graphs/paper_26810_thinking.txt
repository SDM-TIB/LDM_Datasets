To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Semantics-preserving Reinforcement Learning Attack Against Graph Neural Networks for Malware Detection" by Lan Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract indicates that the authors trained GNNs with three types of Windows malware samples and various benign Windows programs, suggesting that there are specific datasets involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly where the authors discuss the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they mention using malware collected from the **VXHeavens Dataset** and the **VirusShare website**. This is a clear indication that these are the datasets utilized in their experiments.

I will also check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. The authors may not provide formal citations for the datasets themselves, but I can look for any relevant papers or sources that describe these datasets.

1. **VXHeavens Dataset**: This dataset is referenced in the paper, and while it may not have a formal citation in the text, it is known in the community. I will note that it is a collection of malware samples.

2. **VirusShare Dataset**: Similar to the VXHeavens Dataset, this is another well-known repository of malware samples. I will also note that it is widely used in malware detection research.

Since these datasets are commonly referenced in the field, I will provide a general description of them rather than formal citations, as they may not have specific papers associated with them.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the names and descriptions of the datasets used in the research. This will provide a clear overview of the datasets referenced in the paper, which is crucial for understanding the context of the experiments conducted by the authors.
