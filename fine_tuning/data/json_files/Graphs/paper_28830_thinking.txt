To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Differentiable and Scalable Generative Adversarial Models for Data Imputation" by Yangyang Wu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on several real-life large-scale datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors describe their experiments using six public real-world incomplete COVID-19 datasets. I will note the names of these datasets and their characteristics.

The datasets mentioned in the paper are:

1. **COVID-19 Trials Tracker Dataset**: Contains 6,433 trials with 9 features and a missing rate of approximately 9.63%.
2. **Emergency Declarations Dataset**: Contains 8,364 samples with 22 features and a missing rate of about 62.69%.
3. **Government Response Dataset**: Contains 200,737 samples with 19 dimensions and a missing rate of 5.66%.
4. **Symptom Search Trends Dataset**: Contains 948,762 samples with 424 symptoms and a missing rate of 81.35%.
5. **Daily Weather Dataset**: Contains 4,911,011 samples from 19,284 regions with a missing rate of 21.56%.
6. **COVID-19 Case Surveillance Public Use Dataset**: Contains 22,507,139 cases with 7 clinical and symptom features and a missing rate of 47.62%.

Next, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

- **COVID-19 Trials Tracker Dataset**:
  > COVID-19 Trials Tracker. *Kaggle*. Available: https://www.kaggle.com/frtgnn/covid19-trials-tracker?select=Covid-19+Trials+Tracker.csv

  > COVID-19 Case Surveillance Public Use Dataset. *Centers for Disease Control and Prevention*. Available: https://data.cdc.gov/Case-Surveillance/COVID-19-Case-Surveillance-Public-Use-Data/vbim-akqf

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or processing.
