To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Improving Question Answering over Knowledge Graphs Using Graph Summarization" by Sirui Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments using four benchmark datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly discuss the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention four datasets:

1. **WikiMovies**: This dataset consists of 96,000 questions related to movies, with a knowledge graph containing 43,000 entities, nine predicates, and 135,000 triples.

2. **WebQuestionsSP**: This dataset has a smaller number of questions but a larger knowledge graph based on Freebase, containing thousands of natural language questions. The authors specify that they used single-relation questions from this dataset.

3. **WC2014**: This dataset is focused on the football domain and is based on a knowledge graph about football players participating in the FIFA World Cup 2014, containing 6,000 triples and 1,000 entities.

4. **Two-Entity WikiMovies**: This dataset was created from the original WikiMovies dataset and contains 14,000 questions, using the same knowledge graph as WikiMovies.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **WikiMovies**, the citation is:
  > Facebook Research. *WikiMovies Dataset*. Available at: https://research.fb.com/downloads/babi/

- For **WebQuestionsSP**, the citation is:
  > Microsoft. *WebQuestionsSP Dataset*. Available at: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=52763

- For **WC2014**, the citation is:
  > ZMTK. *WC2014 Dataset*. Available at: https://github.com/zmtkeke/IRN

- For **Two-Entity WikiMovies**, since it is a newly created dataset based on WikiMovies, I will cite it as:
  > Li, S., Wong, K.W., Fung, C.C., and Zhu, D. *Two-Entity WikiMovies Dataset*. Created from the original WikiMovies dataset.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all necessary information for each dataset mentioned in the paper.
