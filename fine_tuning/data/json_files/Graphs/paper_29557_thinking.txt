To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Label-Invariant Augmentation for Semi-Supervised Graph Classification" by Han Yue et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on "eight benchmark graph-structured data," which indicates that multiple datasets are involved. I will look for specific names of these datasets.

Next, I will navigate to **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors provide details about the datasets used. In this section, they list the datasets along with their characteristics. I will carefully note down the names of the datasets, their categories, and any relevant statistics provided.

The paper lists the following datasets:

1. **MUTAG**: A dataset of biochemical molecules with 188 graphs, 2 classes, an average of 17.93 nodes, and 19.79 edges.
2. **PROTEINS**: Another biochemical dataset with 1113 graphs, 2 classes, an average of 39.06 nodes, and 72.82 edges.
3. **DD**: A biochemical dataset containing 1178 graphs, 2 classes, with an average of 284.32 nodes and 715.66 edges.
4. **NCI1**: This dataset includes 4110 graphs, 2 classes, with an average of 29.87 nodes and 32.30 edges.
5. **COLLAB**: A social network dataset with 5000 graphs, 3 classes, an average of 74.49 nodes, and 2457.78 edges.
6. **RDT-B**: A social network dataset containing 2000 graphs, 2 classes, with an average of 429.63 nodes and 497.75 edges.
7. **RDT-M5K**: Another social network dataset with 4999 graphs, 5 classes, an average of 508.52 nodes, and 594.87 edges.
8. **GITHUB**: A social network dataset with 12725 graphs, 2 classes, an average of 113.79 nodes and 234.64 edges.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and will be included in the dataset descriptions.

The citations for the datasets are as follows:

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, category, statistics, and the full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all necessary information for each dataset mentioned in the paper.
