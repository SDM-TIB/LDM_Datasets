To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Semantic Relationships Guided Representation Learning for Facial Action Unit Recognition" by Guanbin Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted extensive experiments on two public benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental results section**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for evaluation. They state that they evaluated their model on two spontaneous datasets: **BP4D** and **DISFA**. This is a clear indication that these are the datasets I need to extract.

I will then look for detailed descriptions of these datasets within the paper. The authors provide the following information:

1. **BP4D Dataset**: This dataset contains 2D and 3D facial expression data from 41 young adult subjects, including 18 males and 23 females. It consists of 146,847 face images with labeled action units (AUs). The authors mention that they split the dataset into three folds for training and testing.

2. **DISFA Dataset**: This dataset includes stereo videos of 27 subjects from different ethnic backgrounds, totaling 130,815 frame images. Each frame is labeled with intensities from 0-5 for the AUs. The authors also describe their method for selecting positive samples based on AU intensity.

Now, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **BP4D Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Zhang, X., Yin, L., Cohn, J. F., Canavan, S., Reale, M., Horowitz, A., & Liu, P. (2013). A high-resolution spontaneous 3D dynamic facial expression database. In *IEEE International Conference and Workshops on Automatic Face and Gesture Recognition* (pp. 1-6).

- For the **DISFA Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Mavadati, S. M., Mahoor, M. H., Bartlett, K., Trinh, P., & Cohn, J. F. (2013). DISFA: A spontaneous facial action intensity database. *IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing*, 4(2), 151-160.

With this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will allow for a clear and structured presentation of the datasets used in the research.
