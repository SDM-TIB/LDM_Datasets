To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning List-wise Representation in Reinforcement Learning for Ads Allocation with Multiple Auxiliary Tasks" by Ze Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments on a real-world dataset provided by the Meituan food delivery platform. This indicates that there is a dataset involved, but I need to find more specific details.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors describe their dataset in **section 5.1.1 (Dataset)**, where they state that they collected a real-world dataset by running a random exploratory policy on the Meituan platform during March 2021. They provide specific statistics about the dataset, including the number of requests, users, ads, and organic items.

The dataset details are as follows:
- **Dataset Name**: Meituan Food Delivery Dataset
- **Description**: The dataset contains 12,729,509 requests, 2,000,420 users, 385,383 ads, and 726,587 organic items. Each request contains several transitions.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. However, since this dataset is collected from the Meituan platform and does not have a separate publication, I will note that the dataset is proprietary and does not have a formal citation like other datasets.

In summary, I will compile the dataset information as follows:
1. **Dataset Name**: Meituan Food Delivery Dataset
   - **Description**: Contains 12,729,509 requests, 2,000,420 users, 385,383 ads, and 726,587 organic items.
   - **Citation**: Not applicable (proprietary dataset from Meituan).

After gathering this information, I will ensure that it is formatted correctly for any required output or documentation. This structured approach will help me accurately extract and present the dataset information from the research paper.
