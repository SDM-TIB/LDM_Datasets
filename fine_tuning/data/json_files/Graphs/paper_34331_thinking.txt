To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Bounding the Expected Robustness of Graph Neural Networks Subject to Node Feature Attacks" by Yassine Abbahaddou et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their method on several real-world datasets, which indicates that datasets are likely discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this paper, the authors mention using the following datasets:

1. **Cora Dataset**: A citation network dataset commonly used for node classification tasks. It consists of 2,708 nodes and 5,208 edges, with 7 classes.

2. **CiteSeer Dataset**: Another citation network dataset used for node classification, containing 3,327 nodes and 4,552 edges, with 6 classes.

3. **PubMed Dataset**: A dataset derived from PubMed articles, used for node classification, consisting of 19,717 nodes and 44,338 edges, with 3 classes.

4. **Co-author Network (CS)**: A dataset representing co-authorship in the Computer Science domain, with 18,333 nodes and 81,894 edges, containing 15 classes.

5. **OGBN-Arxiv Dataset**: A citation network dataset from arXiv papers, containing 31,971 nodes and 71,669 edges, with 40 classes.

In the **implementation details section**, the authors provide additional context about the datasets, including their characteristics and how they were used in the experiments. This information is crucial for understanding the datasets' relevance to the study.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets are typically found in the references, and I will ensure to include them in my extraction.

- For **Cora Dataset**, the citation is:

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This structured approach will help in accurately extracting and documenting the datasets used in the research paper.
