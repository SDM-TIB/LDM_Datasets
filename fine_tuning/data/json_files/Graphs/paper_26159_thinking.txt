To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Prediction of Small Molecule Kinase Inhibitors for Chemotherapy Using Deep Learning" by Niranjan Balachandar et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on predicting inhibition activity for small molecules targeting specific kinases, which suggests that datasets related to these small molecules and their inhibition activities may be present.

Next, I will examine **section 2 (Related Work)**, where the authors reference previous studies and datasets. Here, they mention the **Kaggle Cancer Inhibitors Dataset**, which is crucial for their research. I will look for specific details about this dataset, such as its structure, the number of samples, and the types of data it contains.

In **section 2.1 (Dataset)**, the authors provide a summary of the Kaggle dataset, including the number of labeled inhibitors and non-inhibitors for each of the eight kinases they focus on. This section is essential as it gives a clear breakdown of the dataset's contents, including the total number of samples for each kinase and the distribution of inhibitors and non-inhibitors.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Kaggle dataset. The authors reference it as:
> K. Xiao, “Cancer inhibitors dataset.” https://www.kaggle.com/xiaotawkaggle/inhibitors.

This citation is important for proper attribution and for anyone who wishes to access the dataset.

Now, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the dataset as required. The key dataset extracted from this paper is the Kaggle Cancer Inhibitors Dataset, which contains labeled data for small molecule inhibitors targeting specific kinases.

After completing this process, I will have a clear and concise entry for the dataset that can be used for further analysis or integration into other systems.
