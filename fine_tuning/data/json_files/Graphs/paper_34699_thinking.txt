To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ALPHAGMUT: A Rationale-Guided Alpha Shape Graph Neural Network to Evaluate Mutation Effects" by Boshen Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the introduction of a novel method for evaluating mutation effects, which suggests that datasets may be involved in the evaluation process.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors discuss the importance of identifying pathogenic mutations and the limitations of existing methods. They mention the use of structural information from the Protein Data Bank (PDB), which indicates that datasets related to protein structures may be utilized.

In the **methods section**, particularly in **section 3.4 (Benchmark Dataset)**, the authors describe their curated benchmark dataset. They specify that this dataset includes mutations with strong evidence of pathogenic and neutral effects, sourced from various databases. The details provided include:

1. **UNIFYPDBACCEPTABLE dataset**: This dataset reflects mutation effects in Mendelian disorders and selects high-confidence genes and mutations based on widely-accepted datasets like HUMVAR, HUMDIV, and PREDICTSNP.

2. **CANCER MUTATION CENSUS (CMC)**: This dataset includes mutations from COSMIC that have clinical, in silico, and experimental evidence, focusing on cancer-related mutations.

The authors also mention that their new benchmark dataset contains a total of 5,715 pathogenic mutations and 4,852 neutral mutations among 469 proteins and 537 PDB chains.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned:

- For the **UNIFYPDBACCEPTABLE dataset**, the citation is:
  > Boshen Wang et al. "Structure-based pathogenicity relationship identifier for predicting effects of single missense variants and discovery of higher-order cancer susceptibility clusters of mutations." *Briefings in Bioinformatics*, 2023.

- For the **CANCER MUTATION CENSUS (CMC)**, the citation is:
  > John G Tate et al. "COSMIC: the catalogue of somatic mutations in cancer." *Nucleic Acids Research*, 47.D1 (2019), pp. D941â€“D947.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
