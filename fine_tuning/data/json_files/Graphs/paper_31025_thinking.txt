To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "RCPS: Rectified Contrastive Pseudo Supervision for Semi-Supervised Medical Image Segmentation" by Xiangyu Zhao et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the proposed method has been validated on **two public datasets and an in-house clinical dataset**, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors describe the datasets used for validation. In this section, they mention:

1. **LA Dataset**: This dataset is noted as the benchmark for the 2018 Atrial Segmentation Challenge, consisting of 100 gadolinium-enhanced labeled MR scans with a specific isotropic resolution. The authors provide details about the data split used for training and validation.

2. **Pancreas-CT Dataset**: This dataset is publicly available from the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center and includes 82 3D abdominal contrast-enhanced CT scans. The authors specify the data split and preprocessing steps.

3. **TBI Dataset**: This in-house dataset consists of MRI scans from patients with traumatic brain injuries, with details about the number of labeled and unlabeled scans, as well as the acquisition method.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The citations I will look for are:

- For the **LA Dataset**, I will find the citation related to the 2018 Atrial Segmentation Challenge.
- For the **Pancreas-CT Dataset**, I will refer to the citation provided by the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center.
- For the **TBI Dataset**, since it is an in-house dataset, I will note that it is based on data collected from patients at Huashan Hospital, but I will also check if there is a specific citation or reference to the methodology used.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described accurately and that the full citations are included for each.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring that they are ready for review or further processing.
