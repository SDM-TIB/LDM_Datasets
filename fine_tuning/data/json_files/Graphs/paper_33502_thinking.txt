To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-Stage Contrastive Regression for Action Quality Assessment" by Qi An et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions a "fine-grained AQA dataset," which suggests that a specific dataset is used for evaluation. I will look for any explicit names or descriptions of datasets in these sections.

Next, I will focus on **section 3.1 (Datasets and Metric)**, where the authors typically provide detailed information about the datasets used in their experiments. Here, I find that they refer to the **FineDiving Dataset**, which is described as consisting of 3000 diving clips with corresponding action labels and sub-action labels for each frame. This section confirms that this dataset is central to their work.

To ensure I have the correct citation for the dataset, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. The citation for the FineDiving Dataset is as follows:
> Jinglin Xu, Yongming Rao, Xumin Yu, Guangyi Chen, Jie Zhou, and Jiwen Lu. “Finediving: A fine-grained dataset for procedure-aware action quality assessment,” in Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2022, pp. 2949–2958.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets explicitly, I will conclude that the FineDiving Dataset is the primary dataset used for the experiments in this research.

Now, I will summarize the findings:
1. **FineDiving Dataset**: A fine-grained dataset for action quality assessment, consisting of 3000 diving clips with 52 action categories and sub-action labels for each frame.

Finally, I will prepare to compile this information into a structured format for further processing, ensuring that I have accurately captured the dataset details and their citations.
