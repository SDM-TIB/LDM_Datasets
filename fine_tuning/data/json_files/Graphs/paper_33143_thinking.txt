To extract datasets from the research paper titled "OmniSeg3D: Omniversal 3D Segmentation via Hierarchical Contrastive Learning" by Haiyang Ying et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the need for a general 3D segmentation method and hints at the use of datasets for evaluation. The introduction elaborates on the challenges in 3D segmentation and suggests that datasets are crucial for training and evaluation.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** within the paper. In this case, I find that the authors discuss their dataset in **section 4.1 (Hierarchical 3D Segmentation)**. Here, they specify that they utilize the **Replica dataset**, which is processed by Semantic-NeRF. The authors describe the dataset as comprising 8 realistic indoor scenes, with a total of 281 images annotated for hierarchical semantic segmentation.

To ensure I have the correct citation for the dataset, I will check the **References section** of the paper. The citation for the Replica dataset is as follows:
> Julian Straub, Thomas Whelan, Lingni Ma, Yufan Chen, Erik Wijmans, Simon Green, Jakob J. Engel, Raul Mur-Artal, Carl Ren, Shobhit Verma, Anton Clarkson, Mingfei Yan, Brian Budge, Yajie Yan, Xiaqing Pan, June Yon, Yuyang Zou, Kimberly Leon, Nigel Carter, Jesus Briales, Tyler Gillingham, Elias Mueggler, Luis Pesqueira, Manolis Savva, Dhruv Batra, Hauke M. Strasdat, Renzo De Nardi, Michael Goesele, Steven Lovegrove, and Richard Newcombe. *The Replica dataset: A digital replica of indoor spaces*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1906.05797, 2019.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the key details:

1. **Dataset Name**: Replica dataset
   - **Description**: A dataset comprising 8 realistic indoor scenes with 281 images annotated for hierarchical semantic segmentation.
   - **Citation**: Julian Straub et al. *The Replica dataset: A digital replica of indoor spaces*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1906.05797, 2019.

Since the paper primarily focuses on this dataset for evaluation, I will conclude my extraction process here. I will compile the dataset information into a structured format for further use or analysis.
