To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Pose Refinement Graph Convolutional Network for Skeleton-based Action Recognition" by Shijie Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the proposed method is evaluated on two challenging action recognition datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed present. I will note this down as a starting point.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (Section IV) where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they refer to two datasets: **Kinetics** and **NTU RGB+D**. I will extract the details provided for each dataset, including their characteristics and the context in which they were used.

1. **Kinetics Dataset**: The authors describe Kinetics as containing video clips of 400 action classes retrieved from YouTube. They mention that the dataset includes 240,000 training clips and 20,000 validation clips, with 2D human poses extracted using OpenPose.

2. **NTU RGB+D Dataset**: This dataset is described as containing 56,880 video clips with 60 actions performed by 40 individuals. The authors specify that the 3D human poses are estimated using the Kinect v2 SDK, and they outline two evaluation protocols: Cross-subject and Cross-view.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **Kinetics dataset**, the citation is:
  > Kay, W., Carreira, J., Simonyan, K., Zhang, B., Hillier, C., Vijayanarasimhan, S., Viola, F., Green, T., Back, T., Natsev, P., et al. (2017). *The kinetics human action video dataset*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1705.06950.

- For the **NTU RGB+D dataset**, the citation is:
  > Shahroudy, A., Liu, J., Ng, T.-T., & Wang, G. (2016). *NTU RGB+D: A large scale dataset for 3D human activity analysis*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pp. 1010â€“1019.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that highlights each dataset's name, description, and citation. This will ensure that I have a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for any further processing or review.
