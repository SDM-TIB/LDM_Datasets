To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Visual Semantic Reasoning for Image-Text Matching" by Kunpeng Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. In the abstract, the authors state that their method achieves state-of-the-art results on **MS-COCO** and **Flickr30K** datasets. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for their experiments.

Next, I will check the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors discuss the datasets in detail. In **section 4.1**, they provide specific information about the datasets used:

1. **MS-COCO Dataset**: The authors mention that MS-COCO includes 123,287 images, each annotated with 5 text descriptions. They follow specific splits for training, validation, and testing.

2. **Flickr30K Dataset**: This dataset consists of 31,783 images, each accompanied by 5 human-annotated text descriptions. The authors also mention the standard training, validation, and testing splits used for evaluation.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **MS-COCO Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, Serge Belongie, James Hays, Pietro Perona, Deva Ramanan, Piotr DollÃ¡r, and C Lawrence Zitnick. *Microsoft COCO: Common objects in context*. In Proceedings of the European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), 2014.

- For the **Flickr30K Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Peter Young, Alice Lai, Micah Hodosh, and Julia Hockenmaier. *From image descriptions to visual denotations: New similarity metrics for semantic inference over event descriptions*. Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics (TACL), 2014.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations as required. This structured approach will help ensure that I accurately capture all relevant details about the datasets used in the research.
