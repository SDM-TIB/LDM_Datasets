To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Embedding Vector Differences Can Be Aligned With Uncertain Intensional Logic Differences" by Ben Goertzel et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research context, and while it does not explicitly mention datasets, it refers to "genomic analyses" and "biological ontologies," which may imply the use of specific datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors discuss their work with the OpenCog Atomspace and the Bio-Atomspace. They mention utilizing knowledge from "multiple bio-ontologies" and results from "statistical and machine learning analysis of various genomics datasets from longevity-related studies." This indicates that there are datasets involved, but I need to find specific names.

In the **methodology section**, the authors describe their use of the DeepWalk algorithm to create embeddings from the Atomspace. They mention "paths through the Atomspace knowledge hypergraph" and provide examples of paths, but they do not explicitly name datasets here. However, they refer to "genomics datasets from longevity-related studies," which suggests that there are specific datasets used for analysis.

I will then check the **references section** for any citations that might correspond to datasets. The references include works that may describe the datasets used in their analysis. I will look for any papers that specifically mention datasets related to genomics or biological ontologies.

After reviewing the references, I find the following relevant citations:

1. For the **Bio-Atomspace** and its utilization in genomic studies, the citation is:
   > Goertzel, B., Geisweiller, N., Monroe, E., Duncan, M., Yilma, S., Dastaw, M., Bayetta, M., Belayneh, A., Ikle, M., Yu, G. (2015). Speculative scientific inference via synergetic combination of probabilistic logic and evolutionary pattern recognition. In Proceedings of the 8th International Conference on Artificial General Intelligence - Volume 9205 (pp. 80–89). Springer-Verlag, Berlin, Heidelberg.

2. For the **DeepWalk algorithm**, which is used for generating embeddings, the citation is:
   > Perozzi, B., Al-Rfou, R., Skiena, S. (2014). Deepwalk: Online learning of social representations. In Proceedings of the 20th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (pp. 701–710). Association for Computing Machinery, New York, NY, USA.

While the paper does not provide specific dataset names, it indicates that the authors are working with datasets related to genomics and biological ontologies. Therefore, I will summarize the findings as follows:

1. **Bio-Atomspace**: A knowledge representation framework that incorporates various genomics datasets related to longevity studies.
2. **DeepWalk**: An algorithm used to generate embeddings from the Atomspace, which may involve datasets related to social representations.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as identified in the references.
