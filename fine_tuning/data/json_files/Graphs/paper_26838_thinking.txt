To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Simple and Effective Self-Supervised Contrastive Learning Framework for Aspect Detection" by Tian Shi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on "publicly available benchmark user review datasets," which indicates that datasets are indeed used.

Next, I will focus on the **Experiments section**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets they used. In this section, they mention training and evaluating their methods on **seven datasets**: 

1. **Citysearch restaurant reviews**: This dataset is referenced as being from Ganu, Elhadad, and Marian (2009).
2. **Amazon product reviews**: The authors state that these reviews are obtained from the OPOSUM dataset, which is attributed to Angelidis and Lapata (2018).

The paper further specifies that the Amazon reviews are divided into six subsets across different domains, including Laptop Cases, Bluetooth Headsets, Boots, Keyboards, Televisions, and Vacuums. Each subset has specific aspect labels, which are detailed in the tables.

I will also check the **References section** to gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

- For the **Citysearch dataset**, the citation is:
  > Ganu, G., Elhadad, N., & Marian, A. (2009). Beyond the stars: improving rating predictions using review text content. In Proceedings of the 12th International Workshop on the Web and Databases (WebDB 2009), 1–6. Citeseer.

- For the **OPOSUM dataset**, the citation is:
  > Angelidis, S., & Lapata, M. (2018). Summarizing Opinions: Aspect Extraction Meets Sentiment Prediction and They Are Both Weakly Supervised. In Proceedings of the 2018 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, 3675–3686. ACL.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations as required. 

After completing this process, I will have a structured output ready for review or further processing, ensuring that all datasets are accurately represented with their respective citations.
