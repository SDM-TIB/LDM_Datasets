To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Identity-Aware Semi-Supervised Learning for Comic Character Re-Identification" by GÃ¼rkan Soykan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors created two new datasets specifically for their experiments, which is a strong indication that I should look for detailed descriptions of these datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, where the authors describe the datasets in detail. They mention the following datasets:

1. **Comic Character Instances Dataset**: This dataset contains over a million character instances generated using the DASS Detector framework applied to the COMICS dataset. The authors provide specific details about the dataset's composition, including the number of face and body images.

2. **Comic Sequence Identity Dataset**: This dataset includes annotations of identities within more than 3000 sets of four consecutive comic panels. The authors explain how this dataset was collected and its significance for their research.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For the **Comic Character Instances Dataset**, the citation is:
> Iyyer, M., Manjunatha, V., Guha, A., Vyas, Y., Boyd-Graber, J., au2, H. D. I., & Davis, L. (2017). The Amazing Mysteries of the Gutter: Drawing Inferences Between Panels in Comic Book Narratives. arXiv:1611.05118.

For the **Comic Sequence Identity Dataset**, the citation is:
> Topal, B. B., Yuret, D., & Sezgin, T. M. (2022). Domain-Adaptive Self-Supervised Pre-Training for Face & Body Detection in Drawings. arXiv preprint arXiv:2211.10641.

Now that I have the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that highlights each dataset's name, description, and citation. This will ensure that I have a clear and organized representation of the datasets extracted from the paper.
