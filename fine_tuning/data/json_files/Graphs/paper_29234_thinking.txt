To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Event-Aware Multimodal Mobility Nowcasting" by Zhaonan Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their method on several real-world datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically the part where the authors discuss the datasets used. In this section, they mention that they collected four real-world datasets with different spatio-temporal scales and coverage. They also provide a summary table (Table 1) that outlines the details of each dataset.

The datasets mentioned in the paper are:

1. **JONAS-NYC**: This dataset covers the period from October 24, 2015, to January 31, 2016, with a temporal granularity of 30 minutes. It includes demand and supply data for transport modes such as taxi and share bike, and it captures the impact of the historic blizzard Jonas.

2. **JONAS-DC**: Similar to JONAS-NYC, this dataset spans the same time period but has a temporal granularity of 1 hour. It also includes demand and supply data for transport modes during the blizzard.

3. **COVID-CHI**: This dataset covers the period from July 1, 2019, to December 31, 2020, with a temporal granularity of 2 hours. It includes data on demand and supply for various transport modes during the COVID-19 pandemic.

4. **COVID-US**: This dataset spans from November 14, 2019, to May 31, 2020, with a temporal granularity of 1 hour. It focuses on travel purpose data across the United States during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Now, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The authors reference previous studies that utilized these datasets, which will help in constructing the citations.

- For **JONAS-NYC** and **JONAS-DC**, the citation is:
  > Wang, Z., Jiang, R., Song, X., & Shibasaki, R. (2016). *Forecasting Urban Mobility Patterns during Extreme Weather Events: A Case Study of the Blizzard Jonas*. In Proceedings of the 25th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery & Data Mining.

- For **COVID-CHI**, the citation is:
  > Wang, Z., Jiang, R., Song, X., & Shibasaki, R. (2021). *Forecasting Urban Mobility Patterns during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Case Study of Chicago*. In Proceedings of the 37th IEEE International Conference on Data Engineering (ICDE).

- For **COVID-US**, the citation is:
  > Jiang, R., Wang, Z., Cai, Z., & Shibasaki, R. (2021). *Countrywide Origin-Destination Matrix Prediction and Its Application for COVID-19*. In Joint European Conference on Machine Learning and Knowledge Discovery in Databases.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes its full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I do not miss any important details and that the citations are complete and correctly formatted.
