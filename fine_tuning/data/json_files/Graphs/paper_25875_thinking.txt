To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Unsupervised Place Discovery for Visual Place Classification" by Fei Xiaoxiao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract references the use of the **University of Michigan North Campus Long-Term (NCLT) Dataset** for evaluating the proposed methods, which indicates that this dataset is crucial for the research.

Next, I will look into the **Approach** section, specifically in **2.1 System Overview**, where the authors describe their experimental setup. They mention that their experimental system is based on the NCLT Dataset, confirming its significance in their research.

In **section 3 (Experiments)**, I will check for any additional datasets that may have been used for training or testing. The authors specify that they used images and viewpoint information from the NCLT Dataset for both training and testing phases, further emphasizing its role in their experiments.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citation for the NCLT Dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:
> N. Carlevaris-Bianco, A. K. Ushani, and R. M. Eustice. *University of Michigan North Campus Long-Term Vision and Lidar Dataset*. The International Journal of Robotics Research, 2015.

Since the NCLT Dataset is the only dataset explicitly mentioned in the paper, I will focus on this dataset for my extraction.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and full citation as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the dataset used in the research.
