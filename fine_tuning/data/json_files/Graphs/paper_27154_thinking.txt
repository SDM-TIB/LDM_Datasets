To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Research Reproducibility as a Survival Analysis" by Edward Raff, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on reproducibility in machine learning, but it does not specify any datasets. The introduction discusses previous work by Raff (2019) and mentions that the original data used was made public but with explicit paper titles removed. This indicates that there is a dataset involved, but I need to find more details.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Study Data)**, where the author describes how the dataset was developed. Here, it is stated that the original data used by Raff (2019) was augmented to perform the current study. The section mentions that the dataset includes survival times for 90 out of the 162 papers that were reproduced. This is a crucial piece of information, as it indicates the dataset's purpose and the number of entries.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the original dataset used by Raff (2019). The paper references the following:

- Raff, E. (2019). *A Step Toward Quantifying Independently Reproducible Machine Learning Research*. In NeurIPS. URL: http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.06674.

This citation is essential as it provides the source of the dataset used in the current study.

Now, I will summarize the findings regarding the datasets:

1. **Original Dataset from Raff (2019)**: This dataset includes features and public data related to the reproducibility of 255 papers in machine learning. The dataset has been augmented to include survival times for 90 papers.

2. **Link to Dataset**: The dataset can be found at the following URL: https://github.com/EdwardRaff/Research-Reproducibility-Survival-Analysis.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required.
