To extract datasets from the research paper titled "FastGCN: Fast Learning with Graph Convolutional Networks via Importance Sampling" by Jie Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the paper's focus and any datasets that may be referenced. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on various benchmark tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section 4) in detail, as this is where datasets are typically described. In this section, the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. They mention three datasets:

1. **Cora Dataset**: This dataset is used for classifying research topics and consists of 2,708 nodes, 5,429 edges, and 7 classes. The features are represented by a 1,433-dimensional vector.

2. **Pubmed Dataset**: This dataset is utilized for categorizing academic papers. It contains 19,717 nodes, 44,338 edges, and 3 classes, with features represented by a 500-dimensional vector.

3. **Reddit Dataset**: This dataset is used for predicting community structures in a social network. It has 232,965 nodes, 11,606,919 edges, and 41 classes, with features represented by a 602-dimensional vector.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **Cora Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Andrew Kachites McCallum, Kamal Nigam, Jason Rennie, and Kristie Seymore. *Automating the construction of internet portals with machine learning*. Inf. Retr., 3(2):127–163, July 2000.

- For the **Pubmed Dataset**, the citation is:
  > David K. Duvenaud, Dougal Maclaurin, Jorge Iparraguirre, Rafael Bombarell, Timothy Hirzel, Alan Aspuru-Guzik, and Ryan P. Adams. *Convolutional networks on graphs for learning molecular fingerprints*. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 28, pp. 2224–2232. Curran Associates, Inc., 2015.

- For the **Reddit Dataset**, the citation is:
  > William L. Hamilton, Rex Ying, and Jure Leskovec. *Inductive representation learning on large graphs*. CoRR, abs/1706.02216, 2017.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or analysis.
