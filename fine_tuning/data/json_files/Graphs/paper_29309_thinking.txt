To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Synthetic Graph Generation to Benchmark Graph Learning" by Anton Tsitsulin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the need for more diverse datasets in graph learning benchmarks, which suggests that the authors may reference specific datasets later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **related work** or **evaluation** sections. In this paper, the authors mention existing benchmark datasets like **TUBenchmark** and **Open Graph Benchmark** in the related work section. I will note these down as they are relevant to the context of the research.

In the **case studies** section, the authors describe their synthetic graph generation framework, which is a key contribution of the paper. However, they do not provide specific datasets but rather discuss the generation of synthetic datasets for benchmarking purposes. I will summarize this aspect, noting that the paper introduces a synthetic graph generator rather than relying on existing datasets.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for the mentioned datasets. The citations for **TUBenchmark** and **Open Graph Benchmark** are as follows:

- For **TUBenchmark**, the citation is:
  > Morris, C., Kriege, N. M., Bause, F., Kersting, K., Mutzel, P., & Neumann, M. (2020). Tudataset: A collection of benchmark datasets for learning with graphs. arXiv preprint arXiv:2007.08663.

- For **Open Graph Benchmark**, the citation is:
  > Hu, W., Fey, M., Zitnik, M., Dong, Y., Ren, H., Liu, B., Catasta, M., & Leskovec, J. (2020). Open graph benchmark: Datasets for machine learning on graphs. In NeurIPS.

Now, I will compile the information about the datasets into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets referenced in the paper.
