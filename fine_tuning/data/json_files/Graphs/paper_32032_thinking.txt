To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Instant Representation Learning for Recommendation over Large Dynamic Graphs" by Cheng Wu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on **six real-world datasets**, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section IV (Experiments)**, where the authors typically provide detailed information about the datasets used. In this section, they list the datasets as follows:

1. **UCI Dataset**: This dataset contains message communications between students at the University of California, Irvine, in an online community. It is described as a streaming homogeneous network.

2. **Amazon Dataset**: A static multiplex heterogeneous network that includes product metadata and links between products, specifically from the Electronic category.

3. **Last.fm Dataset**: This dataset includes user listening habits collected from the Last.fm API, representing interactions between users and artists.

4. **MovieLens Dataset**: Contains 5-star ratings and free-text tagging activity from the MovieLens recommendation service.

5. **Taobao Dataset**: Offered by Alibaba, this dataset includes user behaviors collected from Taobao, with various interactions between users and items.

6. **Kuaishou Dataset**: Collected from the Kuaishou online video-watching platform, this dataset includes interactions of users with videos.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:

Now that I have gathered the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
