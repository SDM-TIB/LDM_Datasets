To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Padding Aware Neurons" by Dario Garcia-Gasulla et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a concise overview of the research, and I will look for any mentions of datasets used in the experiments. 

In the **introduction**, I will look for any statements that indicate the datasets used for training or evaluation. If the authors mention specific datasets or benchmarks, I will note them down.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, where the authors typically describe their experimental setup. This section often includes detailed information about the datasets, such as their names, sizes, and characteristics. I will pay close attention to any tables or figures that summarize the datasets used.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **results section** to see if the authors discuss the performance of their methods on these datasets. This can provide additional context about the datasets' relevance to the research.

Finally, I will consult the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. It is crucial to ensure that I have the correct and complete citation for each dataset, as this will be important for proper attribution.

For this paper, I will look for datasets such as:

1. **ILSVRC2012**: This dataset is commonly used in image classification tasks and is likely mentioned in the context of the experiments.
2. **Caltech101**: This dataset may be referenced as it is often used for testing various computer vision models.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details along with their full citations. This will ensure that I have a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, ready for further processing or review.
