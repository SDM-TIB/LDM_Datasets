To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Revisiting Contextual Toxicity Detection in Conversations" by Atijit Anuchitanukul et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on toxicity detection in conversations, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any explicit mentions of datasets. The authors reference previous studies and datasets related to toxicity detection, which indicates that I should look for specific names and details.

In the **methodology section**, the authors describe several datasets used in their experiments. I will focus on the following datasets mentioned:

1. **FBK Dataset**: This dataset is a subset of the dataset for abusive language detection introduced by Founta et al. It was annotated in two phases, first without context and then with context, resulting in a total of 7,863 samples.

2. **Build-It Break-It Fix-It (BBF) Dataset**: This dataset was constructed by crowd-workers who produced adversarial utterances to challenge toxicity classifiers. It contains 25,476 samples.

3. **Bot-Adversarial Dialogue (BAD) Dataset**: This dataset consists of conversations between crowd-workers and dialogue models, with a total of 78,874 samples.

4. **Hateful Qian Reddit (HQR) Dataset**: This dataset was collected from Reddit using a keyword-based strategy, resulting in 21,710 samples.

5. **Gab (HQG) Dataset**: Similar to HQR, this dataset was collected from Gab, also using a keyword-based strategy, with a total of 32,039 samples.

6. **Contextual Abuse Dataset (CAD)**: This dataset was built by sampling posts from Reddit and contains 23,417 samples.

I will then check the **references section** for full citations of these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. 

The citations I will extract are:

- For the **FBK Dataset**:
  > Antigoni-Maria Founta, Constantinos Djouvas, Despoina Chatzakou, Ilias Leontiadis, Jeremy Blackburn, Gianluca Stringhini, Athena Vakali, Michael Sirivianos, and Nicolas Kourtellis. *Large Scale Crowdsourcing and Characterization of Twitter Abusive Behavior*. In ICWSM, 2018.

- For the **BBF Dataset**:
  > Emily Dinan, Samuel Humeau, Bharath Chintagunta, and Jason Weston. *Build it Break it Fix it for Dialogue Safety: Robustness from Adversarial Human Attack*. CoRR abs/1908.06083, 2019.

- For the **BAD Dataset**:

- For the **HQR Dataset**:
  > Jing Qian, Anna Bethke, Yinyin Liu, Elizabeth M. Belding, and William Yang Wang. *A Benchmark Dataset for Learning to Intervene in Online Hate Speech*. CoRR abs/1909.04251, 2019.

- For the **HQG Dataset**:
  > Jing Qian, Anna Bethke, Yinyin Liu, Elizabeth M. Belding, and William Yang Wang. *A Benchmark Dataset for Learning to Intervene in Online Hate Speech*. CoRR abs/1909.04251, 2019.

- For the **CAD Dataset**:
  > Bertie Vidgen, Dong Nguyen, Helen Margetts, Patricia Rossini, and Rebekah Tromble. *Introducing CAD: the Contextual Abuse Dataset*. In Proceedings of the 2021 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, 2021.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This structured approach will help in creating a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
