To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Graph Convolutional Neural Networks for Optimal Power Flow Locational Marginal Price" by Adrian-Petru Surani and Rahul Sahetiya, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the datasets used.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments or results sections**. In this paper, the authors mention using the **IEEE 118-bus standard testing cases** for their numerical analysis. This indicates that there is a specific dataset being utilized for their experiments.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citation for the IEEE 118-bus dataset. The IEEE 118-bus system is a well-known benchmark in power systems research, and its citation is typically found in standard literature.

The citation for the IEEE 118-bus system is:
> "IEEE Power and Energy Society, 'IEEE 118 Bus Test Case,' IEEE, 2015."

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the dataset details. The IEEE 118-bus system is a widely used benchmark for testing algorithms in power system analysis, particularly for optimal power flow problems.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry with the full citation into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that all necessary information is captured accurately and is ready for downstream applications.
