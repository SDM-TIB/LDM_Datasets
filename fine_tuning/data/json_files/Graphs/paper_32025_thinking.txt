To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Graph Neural Networks for Contextual ASR with the Tree-Constrained Pointer Generator" by Guangzhi Sun et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their method using the **Librispeech** and **AMI corpus**, which suggests that these are the datasets of interest.

Next, I will look for specific details about these datasets in the **experimental setup section**. Here, the authors describe the **Librispeech corpus** as consisting of 960 hours of read English from audiobooks, with specific subsets used for validation and evaluation. They also mention the **AMI meeting corpus**, which consists of 100 hours of meeting recordings divided into training, development, and evaluation sets.

I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **Librispeech Dataset**: This dataset is used for evaluating the performance of the proposed method. It contains 960 hours of read English from audiobooks, with specific subsets (dev-clean, dev-other, test-clean, test-other) used for validation and evaluation.

2. **AMI Meeting Corpus**: This dataset consists of 100 hours of meeting recordings involving multiple individuals. It is divided into training, development, and evaluation sets, with a specific subset of 10% of the utterances used for fine-tuning the models.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Librispeech Dataset**, the citation is:
  > V. Panayotov, G. Chen, D. Povey & S. Khudanpur. *LibriSpeech: An ASR corpus based on public domain audio books*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP), pages 5206–5210, 2015.

- For the **AMI Meeting Corpus**, the citation is:
  > J. Carletta, S. Ashby, S. Bourban, M. Flynn, M. Guillemot, T. Hain, J. Kadlec, V. Karaiskos, W. Kraaij, M. Kronenthal, G. Lathoud, M. Lincoln, A. Lisowska, I. McCowan, W. Post, D. Reidsma, & P. Wellner. *The AMI meeting corpus: A preannouncement*. In Proceedings of the International Workshop on Machine Learning for Multimodal Interaction (MLMI), pages 1–6, 2006.

With this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and includes its full citation. This structured approach will help in accurately documenting the datasets used in the research paper for future reference or analysis.
