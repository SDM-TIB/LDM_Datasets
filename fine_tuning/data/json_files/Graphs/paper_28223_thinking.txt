To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Contrastive Representation Learning for Exemplar-Guided Paraphrase Generation" by Haoran Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that experiments were conducted on two datasets, which suggests that they will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention:

1. **ParaNMT**: This dataset consists of approximately 500,000 training pairs, 800 testing pairs, and 500 validation pairs, generated through back-translation of original English sentences.

2. **QQP-Pos**: This dataset contains 130,000 training pairs, 3,000 testing pairs, and 3,000 validation pairs of Quora question pairs, noted for being more formal than ParaNMT.

Both datasets are crucial for understanding the context of the experiments conducted in the paper.

To ensure I have the correct citations, I will check the **References section** of the paper for the full citations of the datasets:

- For **ParaNMT**, the citation is:
  > Mingda Chen, Qingming Tang, Sam Wiseman, and Kevin Gimpel. *Controllable paraphrase generation with a syntactic exemplar*. In Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, pages 5972â€“5984, 2019.

- For **QQP-Pos**, the citation is:
  > Ashutosh Kumar, Kabir Ahuja, Raghuram Vadapalli, and Partha Talukdar. *Syntax-guided controlled generation of paraphrases*. Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics, 2020.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will summarize the findings:

1. **ParaNMT**: A dataset for paraphrase generation with a large number of sentence pairs generated via back-translation.
2. **QQP-Pos**: A dataset of Quora question pairs, used for evaluating the model's performance in generating paraphrases.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation.
