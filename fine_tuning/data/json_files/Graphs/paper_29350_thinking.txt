To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Content Driven Audio-Visual Deepfake Dataset and Multimodal Method for Temporal Forgery Localization" by Zhixi Cai et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract introduces a new dataset called **Localized Audio Visual DeepFake (LAV-DF)**, which is specifically designed for learning temporal forgery localization. This is a strong indication that I need to gather details about this dataset.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments sections**. In this paper, the authors describe the LAV-DF dataset in detail in **Section III (Proposed Dataset)**. Here, they outline the dataset's creation process, including sourcing real videos from the **VoxCeleb2 dataset** and the manipulation techniques used.

The paper states that the LAV-DF dataset contains **136,304 videos**, with a breakdown of real and fake segments. This section provides crucial information about the dataset's size and structure.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The citations I need to extract are:

1. **VoxCeleb2 Dataset**: The citation is:
   > J. S. Chung, A. Nagrani, and A. Zisserman. *VoxCeleb2: Deep Speaker Recognition*. In INTERSPEECH, 2018.

2. **Localized Audio Visual DeepFake (LAV-DF)**: Since this is a new dataset introduced in the paper, it does not have a separate citation in the references. However, I will note that it is created by the authors of this paper.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets in a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured output that is ready for review or further processing.
