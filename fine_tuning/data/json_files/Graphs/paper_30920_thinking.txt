To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Predicting Citi Bike Demand Evolution Using Dynamic Graphs" by Alexander Saff et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the relevant datasets.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. In the abstract, the authors refer to the **Citi Bike dataset**, indicating that this dataset is central to their research.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for more context. The authors mention that they are applying a graph neural network model to predict bike demand in the **Citi Bike network**. This reinforces the importance of the Citi Bike dataset for their analysis.

In the **problem formulation section**, the authors describe the Citi Bike dataset in more detail, stating that it consists of data from **1475 stations** with bike counts recorded in **30-minute time steps**. This section confirms the dataset's structure and relevance to their study.

I will also check the **project links section** (Section V) for any additional datasets or resources. The authors provide a link to the Citi Bike dataset, which is crucial for citation purposes.

Now, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citation for the Citi Bike dataset. The dataset is linked directly in the text, and the reference is as follows:

- **Citi Bike dataset**: 
  > Citi Bike NYC. *Citi Bike System Data*. Available at: https://ride.citibikenyc.com/system-data.

Since the paper primarily focuses on the Citi Bike dataset, I will document this dataset in detail.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring that I include the full citation as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the dataset used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
