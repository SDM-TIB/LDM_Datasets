To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Forensic Histopathological Recognition via a Context-Aware MIL Network Powered by Self-Supervised Contrastive Learning" by Chen Shen et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors used a large-scale database consisting of **19,607 experimental rat postmortem images** and **3,378 real-world human decedent images**. This suggests that there are two primary datasets involved.

Next, I will look closely at **section 3.1 (Data & Experimental Setup)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used:

1. **Rat Postmortem Histopathology Dataset**: This dataset includes images from 90 Sprague-Dawley adult male rats, with a total of **19,607 images** collected from various organs (brain, heart, kidney, liver, lung, pancreas, and spleen) at different magnifications (5×, 10×, 20×, and 40×). The dataset is split into training, validation, and test sets.

2. **Human Forensic Histopathology Dataset**: This dataset consists of **3,378 images** from 32 decedents, also covering the same seven organs and recorded at three magnifications (5×, 10×, and 20×). The dataset is similarly divided into training, validation, and test sets.

To ensure accuracy, I will verify the details in the **experiments section** where the authors discuss the datasets used for their experiments. They confirm that both the rat and human datasets were utilized in their evaluations.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. However, since the datasets are likely not published as standalone works, I will cite the paper itself as the source of the datasets.

The citations for the datasets will be as follows:

- For the **Rat Postmortem Histopathology Dataset**, I will cite the paper:
  > Chen Shen, Jun Zhang, Xinggong Liang, Zeyi Hao, Kehan Li, Fan Wang, Zhenyuan Wang, and Chunfeng Lian. *Forensic Histopathological Recognition via a Context-Aware MIL Network Powered by Self-Supervised Contrastive Learning*. In Proceedings of the [Conference Name], [Year].

- For the **Human Forensic Histopathology Dataset**, I will use the same citation:
  > Chen Shen, Jun Zhang, Xinggong Liang, Zeyi Hao, Kehan Li, Fan Wang, Zhenyuan Wang, and Chunfeng Lian. *Forensic Histopathological Recognition via a Context-Aware MIL Network Powered by Self-Supervised Contrastive Learning*. In Proceedings of the [Conference Name], [Year].

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited.
