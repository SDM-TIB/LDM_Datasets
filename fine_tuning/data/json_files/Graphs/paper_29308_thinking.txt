To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Breaking the De-Pois Poisoning Defense" by Alaa Anani et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the De-Pois defense and its vulnerabilities but does not explicitly mention datasets. Therefore, I will look for specific references to datasets in the introduction and methodology.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the context of machine learning attacks and defenses but do not name any datasets. I will proceed to the **methodology section**, where they mention conducting experiments using the **MNIST dataset**. This is a well-known dataset for handwritten digit recognition, and its mention indicates that it is used in their experiments.

Next, I will check the **results section** to confirm that the MNIST dataset is indeed the dataset used for their experiments. The authors state that they conducted their experiments in the scope of the MNIST dataset, which confirms its use.

Now, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citation for the MNIST dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:

- For the **MNIST dataset**, the citation is:
  > Li Deng. *The MNIST database of handwritten digit images for machine learning research*. IEEE Signal Processing Magazine, 29(6):141â€“142, 2012.

Since the paper primarily discusses the MNIST dataset and does not mention any other datasets, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format.

I will create an entry for the MNIST dataset, ensuring to include the full citation as required. After this, I will prepare the dataset entry for review or further processing.
