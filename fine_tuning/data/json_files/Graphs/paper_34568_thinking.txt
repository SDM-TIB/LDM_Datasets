To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Full-duplex Speech Dialogue Scheme Based On Large Language Models" by Peng Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention any datasets used for evaluation. In this case, the abstract does not explicitly mention any datasets, so I will proceed to the introduction.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of full-duplex dialogue systems but do not specify any datasets. Next, I will look into the **methods section**, particularly focusing on any subsections that might detail the datasets used for training or evaluation.

Upon reaching **section 4 (Experiments and evaluation)**, I find that the authors mention a benchmark dataset they constructed for evaluating their dialogue system. They refer to this dataset as the **"duplex-dialogue-3k"**, which consists of 3,000 entries of dialogue data generated for their experiments. This is a crucial dataset for understanding the performance of their proposed system.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. However, since the "duplex-dialogue-3k" dataset is likely a novel dataset created by the authors, it may not have a separate citation. Instead, I will note that it is described in detail within the paper itself.

Additionally, I will look for any other datasets mentioned in the paper, such as those used for training the speech recognition or text-to-speech models. In the methods section, the authors mention using the **Whisper model** for automatic speech recognition and the **VITS model** for text-to-speech. I will also document these models as they are integral to the system's functionality.

Now, I will compile the information I have gathered about the datasets and models:

1. **duplex-dialogue-3k**: A benchmark dataset created for evaluating the dialogue system, consisting of 3,000 entries of dialogue data.
   - Citation: Not available as it is a novel dataset described in the paper.

2. **Whisper model**: An automatic speech recognition model used in the system.
   - Citation: Radford, A., Kim, J. W., Xu, T., Brockman, G., McLeavey, C., & Sutskever, I. (2023). Robust speech recognition via large-scale weak supervision. In International Conference on Machine Learning, pages 28492–28518. PMLR.

3. **VITS model**: A text-to-speech model used in the system.
   - Citation: Kim, J., Kong, J., & Son, J. (2021). Conditional variational autoencoder with adversarial learning for end-to-end text-to-speech. In International Conference on Machine Learning, pages 5530–5540. PMLR.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare to format it according to the specified requirements for further processing or review.
