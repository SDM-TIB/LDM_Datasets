To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Graph Embedding Using Infomax for ASD Classification and Brain Functional Difference Detection" by Xiaoxiao Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are mentioned or implied. The abstract discusses the use of fMRI data to characterize brain changes in ASD, which suggests that there may be specific datasets related to fMRI studies.

Next, I will examine the **methodology section**, particularly the **Data Acquisition and Preprocessing** subsection, which is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets used in the experiments. Here, the authors mention testing their method on a group of 75 ASD children and 43 healthy controls, indicating that this data is a primary dataset for their study.

In this section, I will note the specifics of the dataset, including the number of subjects and any preprocessing steps mentioned. The authors also refer to the "biopoint" task, which may be relevant for understanding the context of the dataset.

I will also check the **experiments and results section** for any additional datasets or variations of the primary dataset that may have been used, such as augmented data or different splits of the original dataset.

After gathering information about the datasets, I will consult the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. In this case, the authors reference previous works that may have used similar datasets or methodologies, which could provide authoritative citations.

For the dataset extracted from the paper, I will compile the following information:

1. **Dataset Name**: ASD fMRI Dataset
   - **Description**: This dataset consists of fMRI data collected from 75 children diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and 43 age and IQ-matched healthy controls. The data was collected during the "biopoint" task and underwent preprocessing as described in the paper.
   - **Citation**: 
     > Li, X., Dvornek, N. C., Zhuang, J., Ventola, P., & Duncan, J. (2023). Graph Embedding Using Infomax for ASD Classification and Brain Functional Difference Detection. *Preprint, under review of SPIE Biomedical Imaging*.

2. **Dataset Name**: Destrieux Atlas
   - **Description**: The Destrieux atlas is used for parcellating the brain into 148 regions of interest (ROIs) for analysis in the context of the study.
   - **Citation**: 
     > Destrieux, C., et al. (2010). Automatic parcellation of human cortical gyri and sulci using standard anatomical nomenclature. *Neuroimage*, 53(1), 1â€“15.

After compiling this information, I will ensure that the dataset entries are clear and concise, ready for any structured output or further processing as needed. This systematic approach will help ensure that I accurately capture all relevant datasets and their citations from the research paper.
