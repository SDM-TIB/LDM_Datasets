To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Image Difference Captioning with Pre-training and Contrastive Learning" by Linli Yao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on two benchmark datasets: **CLEVR-Change** and **Birds-to-Words**. This is a strong indication that these datasets will be discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors describe their methodology and the datasets used. In this section, they explicitly mention both datasets again, providing context about their use in the experiments. 

1. **CLEVR-Change Dataset**: The authors describe this dataset as being automatically built via the CLEVR engine, focusing on scene changes of geometric objects. They mention that it contains 67,660 training image pairs, 3,976 validation pairs, and 7,970 test pairs, with an average of 6.2 captions per image pair.

2. **Birds-to-Words Dataset**: This dataset is described as containing 4,860 image pairs that depict fine-grained differences among various bird species, with each pair having an average of 3.31 annotated captions.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **CLEVR-Change**, the citation is:
  > Park, D. H., Darrell, T., & Rohrbach, A. (2019). Robust change captioning. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 4624–4633.

- For **Birds-to-Words**, the citation is:
  > Tan, H., Dernoncourt, F., Lin, Z., Bui, T., & Bansal, M. (2019). Expressing Visual Relationships via Language. In Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, 1873–1883.

Now that I have gathered all necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will prepare to compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This includes ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its citation, which is crucial for proper attribution in any subsequent analysis or application.
