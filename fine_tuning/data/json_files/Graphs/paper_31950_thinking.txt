To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Quantifying stimulus-relevant representational drift using cross-modality contrastive learning" by Siwei Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly referenced. The abstract mentions using a "publicly accessible dataset of mouse V1 responses to a natural movie," which indicates that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors discuss the use of publicly available recordings from the Allen Brain Observatory. This suggests that the dataset is related to mouse V1 recordings, but I need to confirm the specific dataset name and details.

In the **methods section**, the authors specify that they used "Neuropixels recordings from V1" and that the dataset contains recordings of mice viewing a 30-second clip from the movie "Touch of Evil." This provides more context about the dataset, including its source and the nature of the recordings.

I will also check the **results section** to see if there are any additional details or clarifications about the dataset used in their experiments. The authors mention that the dataset includes two recording sessions of natural movie stimulus presentation, which further confirms the dataset's relevance.

Now, I will consult the **references section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The authors refer to the Allen Brain Observatory, which is a well-known source for such datasets. The citation for the dataset is likely to be:

- **Allen Brain Observatory Dataset**: 
  > Allen Institute for Brain Science. *Allen Brain Observatory – Neuropixels Visual Coding*. Technical report, 2019.

With this information, I can summarize the dataset as follows:

1. **Dataset Name**: Allen Brain Observatory Dataset
   - **Description**: This dataset contains recordings of mouse V1 responses to a natural movie stimulus, specifically a 30-second clip from "Touch of Evil." It includes Neuropixels recordings from multiple animals and is designed to study representational drift in neural populations.
   - **Full Citation**: Allen Institute for Brain Science. *Allen Brain Observatory – Neuropixels Visual Coding*. Technical report, 2019.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format for further processing or review.
