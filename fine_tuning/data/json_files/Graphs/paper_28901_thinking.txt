To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Generalization Error Bounds on Deep Learning with Markov Datasets" by Lan V. Truong, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction typically outlines the context and significance of the study, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors usually describe the datasets used for their experiments. This section often contains detailed information about the datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, if I find that the paper uses the **MNIST dataset**, I would look for the citation in the references section, which might look something like this:
> Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998.

Once I have gathered the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and citations, ensuring that I provide complete and accurate references for each dataset.

Finally, I will summarize the findings in a structured format that clearly presents each dataset along with its citation, making it easy for readers to understand the sources used in the research.
