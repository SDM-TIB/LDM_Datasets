To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Dynamic Iterative Refinement for Efficient 3D Hand Pose Estimation" by John Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions, but I will need to look deeper for specific dataset names.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of hand pose estimation and mention various benchmarks, but I need to find specific datasets. 

Next, I will focus on **section 6 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for training and evaluation. Here, they mention:

1. **STB Dataset**: This dataset consists of real hand images captured in 18,000 frames under various lighting conditions and backgrounds, with each frame labeled with 3D annotations of 21 joints.

2. **PANOPTIC Dataset**: This dataset is derived from multiple views of the Panoptic studio, containing 14,847 image samples with 2D joint annotations.

3. **FPHA Dataset**: This dataset includes RGB video sequences of 6 subjects performing 45 types of hand activities, annotated with both 2D and 3D labels.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **STB Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Guillermo Garcia-Hernando, Shanxin Yuan, Seungryul Baek, and Tae-Kyun Kim. *First-person hand action benchmark with RGB-D videos and 3D hand pose annotations*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 409–419, 2018.

- For the **PANOPTIC Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Hanbyul Joo, Hao Liu, Lei Tan, Lin Gui, Bart Nabbe, Iain Matthews, Takeo Kanade, Shohei Nobuhara, and Yaser Sheikh. *Panoptic studio: A massively multiview system for social motion capture*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision, pages 3334–3342, 2015.

- For the **FPHA Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Bugra Tekin, Federica Bogo, and Marc Pollefeys. *H+ O: Unified egocentric recognition of 3D hand-object poses and interactions*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 4511–4520, 2019.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will allow for a clear and organized presentation of the datasets used in the research.
