To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MolecularGPT: Open Large Language Model (LLM) for Few-Shot Molecular Property Prediction" by Yuyan Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their model on **10 downstream evaluation datasets**, which suggests that multiple datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (specifically section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In **section 4.1 (Experimental Setup)**, the authors mention using the **MoleculeNet benchmark** and **CYP450 datasets** for their downstream tasks. This is a clear indication that these datasets are significant for their research.

I will then look for detailed descriptions of these datasets in the **appendices** or **dataset details section** (A.1). Here, the authors provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets, including:

1. **MoleculeNet**: This is a benchmark for molecular machine learning that includes various tasks related to molecular property prediction. The specific citation for this dataset is:
   > Wu, Z., Ramsundar, B., Feinberg, E. N., Gomes, J., Geniesse, C., Pappu, A., Leswing, K., & Pande, V. (2018). Moleculenet: A benchmark for molecular machine learning. *Chemical Science*, 9(2), 513-530.

2. **CYP450 Dataset**: This dataset is used for predicting human cytochrome P450 inhibition. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Li, S., Zhou, J., Xu, T., Dou, D., & Xiong, H. (2018). Prediction of human cytochrome P450 inhibition using a multitask deep autoencoder neural network. *Molecular Pharmaceutics*, 15(10), 4336-4345.

Additionally, the authors mention other datasets in the context of their experiments, such as **ChEMBL bioassay activity dataset**, **Tox21**, and **QM9**. I will ensure to extract these as well:

3. **ChEMBL bioassay activity dataset**: This dataset is used for bioactivity prediction. The citation is:
   > Gaulton, A., Bellis, L. J., Bento, A. P., Chambers, J., Davies, M., & Hersey, A. (2012). ChEMBL: a large-scale bioactivity database for drug discovery. *Nucleic Acids Research*, 40(D1), D1100-D1107.

4. **Tox21**: This dataset is used for toxicity prediction. The citation is:
   > Tice, R. R., Austin, C. P., & Daston, G. P. (2013). The Tox21 project: a strategic partnership for the 21st century toxicology. *Environmental Health Perspectives*, 121(6), 750-751.

5. **QM9**: This dataset contains quantum mechanical properties of small organic molecules. The citation is:
   > Ramakrishnan, R., et al. (2014). Quantum chemistry structures and properties of 134 kilo molecules. *Scientific Data*, 1(1), 1-7.

After gathering all the relevant datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference.

In summary, I will extract the following datasets and their citations:
- MoleculeNet: Wu et al. (2018)
- CYP450: Li et al. (2018)
- ChEMBL bioassay activity dataset: Gaulton et al. (2012)
- Tox21: Tice et al. (2013)
- QM9: Ramakrishnan et al. (2014)

This systematic approach ensures that I capture all necessary details while maintaining the integrity of the citations.
