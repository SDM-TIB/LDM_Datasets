To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Compressive Spectral Image Reconstruction using Deep Prior and Low-Rank Tensor Representation" by Jorge Bacca, Yesid Fonseca, and Henry Arguello, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any references to datasets used for experiments or evaluations.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** in detail. This section typically contains information about the datasets used for validation and testing. I will look for specific names of datasets, their characteristics, and any relevant details about how they were utilized in the experiments.

In this paper, I notice that the authors mention using two datasets for their experiments:

1. **Dataset 1**: The authors refer to spectral images with dimensions of 256x256 pixels and 10 spectral bands, which were chosen from a specific source. I will need to find the exact reference for this dataset in the references section.

2. **Dataset 2**: The authors also mention using another dataset with 512x512 spatial resolution and 31 spectral bands. Again, I will look for the full citation in the references section.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations will provide the necessary details such as authors, title, publication venue, and year.

For **Dataset 1**, the citation is:
> M. Marquez, H. Rueda-Chacon, and H. Arguello. *Compressive spectral light field image reconstruction via online tensor representation*. IEEE Transactions on Image Process., 29, 3558–3568, 2020.

For **Dataset 2**, the citation is:
> B. Arad and O. Ben-Shahar. *Sparse recovery of hyperspectral signal from natural RGB images*. In European Conference on Computer Vision, Springer, 2016, pp. 19–34.

After gathering the dataset names and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset along with its full citation. This will ensure that the datasets are accurately represented and properly attributed in any subsequent analysis or reporting.
