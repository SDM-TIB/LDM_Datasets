To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Massively Scaling Heteroscedastic Classifiers" by Mark Collier et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. In the abstract, the authors mention that their method is evaluated on "large-scale image classification datasets with up to 4B images and 30k classes." This indicates that there are specific datasets used for evaluation, which I need to identify.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments** section. In the introduction, the authors state that they evaluate their method on three image classification benchmarks: **JFT 300M**, **ImageNet-21k**, and **JFT-4B**. This gives me the names of the datasets I need to focus on.

I will then check the **experiments** section for detailed descriptions of these datasets. The authors provide information about the datasets used, including their sizes and characteristics. Here’s what I find:

1. **JFT 300M**: A dataset with over 300 million training images and 18,291 classes.
2. **ImageNet-21k**: An expanded version of the ILSVRC2012 ImageNet benchmark with 12.8 million training examples and 21,843 classes.
3. **JFT-4B**: An expanded version of the JFT dataset with over 4 billion training examples and 29,593 classes.

Next, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **JFT 300M**:
  > Geoffrey Hinton, Oriol Vinyals, and Jeffrey Dean. *Distilling the knowledge in a neural network*. In NIPS Deep Learning and Representation Learning Workshop, 2015. URL: http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.02531.

- For **ImageNet-21k**:
  > Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, and Li Fei-Fei. *Imagenet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In 2009 IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pp. 248–255. IEEE, 2009.

- For **JFT-4B**:
  > Mark Collier, Basil Mustafa, Efi Kokiopoulou, Rodolphe Jenatton, and Jesse Berent. *Correlated input-dependent label noise in large-scale image classification*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 1551–1560, 2021.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will summarize the information for each dataset, ensuring to include the dataset name, description, and full citation.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that is ready for review or further processing.
