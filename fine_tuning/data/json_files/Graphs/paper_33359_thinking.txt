To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Improving Biomedical Entity Linking with Retrieval-Enhanced Learning" by Zhenxi Lin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors achieved state-of-the-art performance on several datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be discussed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experiments)**, where the authors mention that they adopted four BioEL datasets: **NCBI**, **BC5CDR**, **COMETA**, and **AAP**. This section typically provides details about the datasets used for evaluation, including their characteristics and the types of entities they focus on.

In **Table 1**, the authors provide statistics for each dataset, including the number of target entities, training instances, validation instances, and test instances. This information is crucial for understanding the datasets' scope and scale.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:

1. **NCBI Disease Corpus**:
   > Rezarta Islamaj DoÄŸan, Robert Leaman, and Zhiyong Lu. "NCBI Disease Corpus: A Resource for Disease Name Recognition and Concept Normalization." *Journal of Biomedical Informatics*, vol. 47, 2014.

2. **BC5CDR**:
   > Jiao Li, Yueping Sun, Robin J Johnson, Daniela Sciaky, Chih-Hsuan Wei, Robert Leaman, Allan Peter Davis, Carolyn J Mattingly, Thomas C Wiegers, and Zhiyong Lu. "BioCreative V CDR task corpus: a resource for chemical disease relation extraction." *Database*, 2016.

3. **COMETA**:
   > Marco Basaldella, Fangyu Liu, Ehsan Shareghi, and Nigel Collier. "COMETA: A Corpus for Medical Entity Linking in the Social Media." In *Proc. EMNLP*, 2020.

4. **AAP**:
   > Nut Limsopatham and Nigel Collier. "Normalising Medical Concepts in Social Media Texts by Learning Semantic Representation." In *Proc. ACL*, 2016.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **NCBI**: A dataset focusing on disease name recognition and concept normalization, containing a large number of annotated instances.
2. **BC5CDR**: A dataset for extracting chemical-disease relations, providing a resource for evaluating entity linking methods.
3. **COMETA**: A corpus designed for medical entity linking in social media, highlighting the challenges of informal language.
4. **AAP**: A dataset aimed at normalizing medical concepts in social media texts, showcasing the need for robust entity linking in diverse contexts.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its full citation.
