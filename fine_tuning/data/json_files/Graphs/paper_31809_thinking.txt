To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Unlocking the Power of Open Set: A New Perspective for Open-Set Noisy Label Learning" by Wenhai Wan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions "extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets," which indicates that datasets are involved, but I need to find their specific names and details.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of learning from noisy data and mention that they will conduct experiments on various datasets. However, they do not specify the datasets in this section, so I will need to look further.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** where the authors detail their experimental setup. They mention using several datasets, including:

1. **CIFAR80N**: A dataset generated from CIFAR100, which contains an open-set noisy dataset with 20 unknown classes.
2. **CIFAR100N**: A closed-set noisy dataset that examines methods’ versatility with different label noise scenarios.
3. **Web-Aircraft**: A real-world dataset for fine-grained vision categorization.
4. **Web-Bird**: Another real-world dataset for fine-grained vision categorization.
5. **Web-Car**: A real-world dataset similar to the previous ones.
6. **Food101N**: A dataset showcasing 101 food categories with more than 310k examples.

The authors provide a brief description of each dataset, which will help in documenting them accurately.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets mentioned are as follows:

- For **CIFAR100**, the citation is:
  > Krizhevsky, A. (2009). *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 32–33.

- For **Food101**, the citation is:
  > Lee, K.-H., He, X., Zhang, L., & Yang, L. (2018). *CleanNet: Transfer Learning for Scalable Image Classifier Training with Label Noise*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 5447–5456.

- For **Web-Aircraft**, **Web-Bird**, and **Web-Car**, the citations are not explicitly provided in the text, but they are likely referenced in the context of the experiments. I will note that these datasets are used in the experiments but may require further investigation to find their original sources.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is documented with its full citation for clarity and future reference. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture the datasets used in the research paper.
