To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Contrastive Variational Graph Auto-Encoder for Node Clustering" by Nairouz Mrabah et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art clustering results on several datasets, which indicates that datasets are likely discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments** section. This is typically where authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. I will pay close attention to any specific names or descriptions of datasets.

Upon reviewing the **experiments section**, I find that the authors mention using several datasets for evaluation, including:

1. **Cora**: A widely used citation network dataset for machine learning research.
2. **Citeseer**: Another citation network dataset similar to Cora, often used for benchmarking clustering algorithms.
3. **Pubmed**: A dataset derived from the PubMed database, used for document classification and clustering tasks.
4. **Wiki**: A dataset derived from Wikipedia, often used for various natural language processing tasks.
5. **ACM**: A dataset from the Association for Computing Machinery, used for citation analysis.
6. **DBLP**: A dataset containing bibliographic information on major computer science publications.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for future researchers who may want to use these datasets.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

- **Cora**:

- **Citeseer**: 
  > Sen, P., Namata, G., Bilgic, M., Getoor, L., Galligher, B., & Eliassi-Rad, T. (2008). Collective classification in network data. *AI Magazine*, 29(3), 93-93.

- **Pubmed**: 
  > Sen, P., Namata, G., Bilgic, M., Getoor, L., Galligher, B., & Eliassi-Rad, T. (2008). Collective classification in network data. *AI Magazine*, 29(3), 93-93.

- **Wiki**: 
  > Yang, C., Liu, Z., Zhao, D., Sun, M., & Chang, E. (2015). Network representation learning with rich text information. In *IJCAI*.

- **ACM**: 
  > Bo, D., Wang, X., Shi, C., Zhu, M., Lu, E., & Cui, P. (2020). Structural deep clustering network. In *WWW*.

- **DBLP**: 
  > Bo, D., Wang, X., Shi, C., Zhu, M., Lu, E., & Cui, P. (2020). Structural deep clustering network. In *WWW*.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This will ensure that all relevant details are captured and can be easily referenced in future work.
