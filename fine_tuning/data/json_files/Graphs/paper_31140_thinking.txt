To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Linking data separation, visual separation, and classifier performance using pseudo-labeling by contrastive learning" by Bárbara Caroline Benato et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors demonstrate their results using "five real-world challenging image datasets of human intestinal parasites," which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments and Results)**, particularly **subsection 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention three datasets that contain color microscopy images of human intestinal parasites:

1. **H.larvae Dataset**: This dataset consists of 3,514 images divided into 2 classes (S.stercoralis and impurities).
2. **H.eggs Dataset**: This dataset contains 5,112 images across 9 classes (H.nana, H.diminuta, Ancilostomideo, E. vermicularis, A. lumbricoides, T. trichiura, S. mansoni, Taenia, and impurities).
3. **P.cysts Dataset**: This dataset includes 9,568 images across 7 classes (E.coli, E.histolytica, E.nana, Giardia, I.butschlii, B.hominis, and impurities).

The authors also mention that they explore variations of the H.eggs and P.cysts datasets without the impurity class, which form additional datasets for their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. However, since these datasets are likely not published in standalone papers, I will note that the authors reference a previous work for the context of their datasets:

- For the **H.larvae, H.eggs, and P.cysts datasets**, the citation is:
  > Suzuki, C., Gomes, J., Falcão, A., Shimizu, S., and J. Papa. *Automated diagnosis of human intestinal parasites using optical microscopy images*. In Proceedings of the Symposium on Biomedical Imaging, pages 460–463, 2013.

With this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations as required.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for output, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its citation for proper attribution.
