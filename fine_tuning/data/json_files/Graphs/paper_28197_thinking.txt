To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Group-Aware Graph Neural Network for Nationwide City Air Quality Forecasting" by Ling Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract states that the evaluation experiments are conducted on a **Chinese city air quality dataset**, which indicates that a specific dataset is being used.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (Section IV) where the authors provide details about the datasets used. In **Section IV-A (Datasets)**, the authors describe the dataset in detail:

1. **Chinese City Air Quality Dataset**: This dataset includes AQI data and weather data for 209 cities, collected from January 1, 2017, to April 30, 2019. The authors mention that the AQI values are collected from the National Urban Air Quality Real-time Release Platform at a 1-hour granularity, and the weather data is sourced from Envicloud, also at a 1-hour granularity. They note that cities with significant missing data are excluded, and the final dataset consists of 20,370 samples.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. However, since the dataset is derived from publicly available sources (the National Urban Air Quality Real-time Release Platform and Envicloud), it may not have a formal citation like a traditional dataset published in a paper. Instead, I will note the sources as follows:

- **Chinese City Air Quality Dataset**:
  > National Urban Air Quality Real-time Release Platform. Available at: http://106.37.208.233:20035/
  
  > Envicloud. Available at: http://www.envicloud.cn/

After gathering this information, I will summarize the dataset details and citations clearly, ensuring that I have captured all necessary information for future reference or processing. 

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that can be easily reviewed or utilized in further analysis.
