To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Amplify Graph Learning for Recommendation via Sparsity Completion" by Peng Yuan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors conducted experiments on **four real-world datasets related to recommendation tasks**, which indicates that datasets are present.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this section, the authors explicitly list the datasets used for evaluation:

1. **Amazon-Electronics**: This dataset is used for evaluating the recommendation model. It contains user-item interactions from the Amazon platform.

2. **MovieLens100K**: A well-known dataset in the recommendation system community, containing 100,000 ratings from users on movies.

3. **MovieLens1M**: Another popular dataset, this one contains 1 million ratings from users on movies, providing a larger scale for evaluation.

4. **Yelp**: This dataset includes user reviews and ratings for businesses, commonly used for recommendation tasks.

I will then verify the details of these datasets in the **experiments section**, where the authors provide statistics about each dataset, including the number of users, items, interactions, and density.

Next, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and will typically include the authors, title, publication venue, and year.

For example, the citations might look like this (note that I will need to find the actual citations from the references):

- **Amazon-Electronics**: 
  > [Citation details for Amazon-Electronics dataset]

- **MovieLens100K**: 
  > [Citation details for MovieLens100K dataset]

- **MovieLens1M**: 
  > [Citation details for MovieLens1M dataset]

- **Yelp**: 
  > [Citation details for Yelp dataset]

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring that all information is accurate and complete for downstream processing or review.
