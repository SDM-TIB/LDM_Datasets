To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Brief Introduction to Contrastive Learning Pretext Tasks for Visual Representation" by Zhenyuan Lu, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections discussing the methodologies** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract discusses the need for large-scale human-annotated data and mentions self-supervised learning methods, but it does not specify any datasets at this point.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the author discusses the challenges of dataset collection and annotation. While this section provides context, it does not name any specific datasets either. 

I will then examine the **formulation sections** (2.1 to 2.4) and the **contrastive learning section (3)** for any references to datasets used in experiments or examples. However, these sections primarily discuss learning paradigms and methodologies without naming specific datasets.

I will also look for any **figures or examples** that might reference datasets indirectly. For instance, Figure 1 illustrates an experiment by Robert Epstein, but it does not provide a dataset name.

After thoroughly reviewing the paper, I will check the **References section** for any cited datasets. The references include various studies and papers, but they do not explicitly mention datasets used in the context of this research.

Since the paper does not provide specific datasets or their citations, I will conclude that there are no datasets to extract from this paper. If there were datasets mentioned, I would ensure to document them with full citations, following the format used in the references section.

In summary, I will compile my findings, noting that no specific datasets were identified in this paper, and if any were found, I would have included their full citations accordingly.
