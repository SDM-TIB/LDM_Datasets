To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Cancer-inspired Genomics Mapper Model for the Generation of Synthetic DNA Sequences with Desired Genomics Signatures" by Teddy Lazebnik and Liron Simon-Keren, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental design sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their model on two datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental design section** (Section 4), where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. They mention using samples from the **Personal Genomics Project (PGP)** and **Genomic Data Commons (GDC)**. 

1. **Personal Genomics Project (PGP)**: The authors used 300 samples from PGP, divided into control and case sets based on ancestry. Specifically, they used 200 European-dominant DNA sequences as the control set and 100 African-dominant DNA sequences as the case set.

2. **Genomic Data Commons (GDC)**: For the final experiment, they used 30 case samples corresponding to individuals with skin melanoma obtained from GDC.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Personal Genomics Project (PGP)**, the citation is:
  > Chervova, O., Conde, L., Guerra-Assuncao, J. A., et al. (2019). The personal genome project-uk, an open access resource of human multi-omics data. *Scientific Data*, 6, 257.

- For the **Genomic Data Commons (GDC)**, the citation is:
  > Lee, J.-S. (2016). Exploring cancer genomic data from the cancer genome atlas project. *BMB Reports Online*, 49(11), 607-611.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant details regarding the datasets used in the research.
