To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Synthetic Hard Negative Samples for Contrastive Learning" by Hengkui Dong et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the effectiveness of the proposed method on various image datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Experimental settings)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention three datasets:

1. **CIFAR10**: This dataset consists of 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images, with an image size of 32x32 pixels and 10 categories.

2. **CIFAR100**: Similar to CIFAR10, this dataset contains 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images, also with an image size of 32x32 pixels, but it has 100 categories.

3. **TinyImageNet**: This dataset includes 100,000 training images and 10,000 test images, with an image size of 64x64 pixels and 200 categories.

In the **experiments section**, the authors confirm that they used these datasets to evaluate their proposed method, which reinforces the relevance of these datasets for their research.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **CIFAR10** and **CIFAR100**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton, et al. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009.

- For **TinyImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Y. Le, X. Yang. *Tiny ImageNet Visual Recognition Challenge*. CS 231N 7 (7) (2015) 3.

With this information gathered, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes the full citation as required. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details or citations.
