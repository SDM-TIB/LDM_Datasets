To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Constant Time Graph Neural Networks" by Ryoma Sato et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a summary of the research and may mention datasets used for validation. The introduction often discusses the context of the research and may reference specific datasets that are foundational to the study.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. This section typically details the datasets used for testing the proposed methods. I will pay close attention to any specific names or descriptions of datasets, including their characteristics, sizes, and any relevant details that could help in understanding their context.

In the **experiments section**, the authors may describe the datasets used for validation and testing. I will note down any datasets mentioned, including their purpose in the experiments. If the authors provide specific metrics or results related to these datasets, I will also take note of those as they may be relevant for understanding the datasets' significance.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial as it provides the necessary attribution and allows others to locate the datasets easily. I will ensure to capture all relevant details such as authors, title, publication venue, and year.

For example, if the paper mentions the **Cora dataset**, I would look for its citation in the references, which might look something like this:
> McCallum, A., & Kolla, S. (2000). *Efficiently Inducing Features of Document Clusters*. In Proceedings of the 21st International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML), 2000.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I capture all relevant datasets accurately and comprehensively.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset information in a clear format for easy reference, ensuring that it is ready for any further processing or review.
