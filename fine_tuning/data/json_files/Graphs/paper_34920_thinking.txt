To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Heterogeneous Subgraph Network with Prompt Learning for Interpretable Depression Detection on Social Media" by Chen Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors developed a method for depression detection using social media data, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Dataset and Experimental Settings)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention three datasets:

1. **D1: Depressed dataset** - This dataset includes users who posted anchor tweets indicating they were diagnosed with depression. It contains 2,558 users and 1.2 million tweets.

2. **D2: Non-depressed dataset** - This dataset consists of users who have never posted tweets containing the word "depression." It includes 5,304 users and 2.6 million tweets, with a subset sampled to balance the number of positive and negative users.

3. **D3: Depression candidate dataset** - This is a large-scale unlabeled dataset with 58,810 users and 29 million tweets. Although this dataset was not used in the current work, it is mentioned as a potential source for future research.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations related to the datasets. However, the datasets themselves are not typically cited in the references; instead, they are described in the text. The authors do mention that the data is based on a dataset constructed and publicly released by Shen et al. (2017), which I will need to cite.

The citation for the dataset mentioned in the paper is:
> Shen, G., Jia, J., Nie, L., Feng, F., Zhang, C., Hu, T., Chua, T.S., Zhu, W. (2017). *Depression detection via harvesting social media: A multimodal dictionary learning solution*. In Proceedings of the International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI), pages 3838â€“3844.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their descriptions and citations into a structured format for further processing.
