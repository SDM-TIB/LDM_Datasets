To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach for Security-Aware Service Acquisition in IoT" by Marco Arazzi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the datasets used.

Next, I will focus on **section 6 (Experiments and Results)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention that the reference dataset for their experiments was obtained through a simulation software, which generated agent movements and meeting points. They specifically state that they used two existing datasets:

1. **New York City Yellow Taxi Trip Data**: This dataset was used to simulate real-life movements in the city of New York. The authors reference it as a source for generating agent movements.

2. **Active Meeting Points (AMP) Dataset**: This dataset contains information about active establishment locations (e.g., bars and restaurants) in New York City, which was used to identify possible meeting points for the agents.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

- For the **New York City Yellow Taxi Trip Data**, the citation is:
  > NYC Taxi & Limousine Commission. *NYC Yellow Taxi Trip Data*. Available at: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/elemento/nyc-yellow-taxi-trip-data.

- For the **Active Meeting Points Dataset**, the citation is:
  > New York City Open Data. *NYPD Complaint Map Year-to-Date*. Available at: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Complaint-Map-Year-to-Date-/2fra-mtpn.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and includes the full citation as required. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details and that the datasets are accurately represented.
