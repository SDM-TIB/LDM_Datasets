To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Boosting Few-shot Action Recognition with Graph-guided Hybrid Matching" by Jiazheng Xing et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the method shows improvements on several few-shot datasets, which indicates that datasets are likely discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In **section 4.1 (Experimental Setup)**, the authors explicitly list four datasets: **Kinetics**, **HMDB51**, **UCF101**, and **SSv2**. This section provides a brief overview of how these datasets are utilized in their experiments.

To ensure I have the correct details, I will look for any additional descriptions or specifications about these datasets in the text. For instance, the authors mention that for Kinetics and SSv2, they use specific splits provided by other works, which is important for understanding the context of their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research. Here are the citations I will extract:

1. **Kinetics**:
   > Joao Carreira and Andrew Zisserman. *Quo vadis, action recognition? A new model and the kinetics dataset*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 6299–6308, 2017.

2. **HMDB51**:
   > Hildegard Kuehne, Hueihan Jhuang, Estibaliz Garrote, Tomaso Poggio, and Thomas Serre. *HMDB: A large video database for human motion recognition*. In 2011 International Conference on Computer Vision, pages 2556–2563. IEEE, 2011.

3. **UCF101**:
   > Khurram Soomro, Amir Roshan Zamir, and Mubarak Shah. *UCF101: A dataset of 101 human actions classes from videos in the wild*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1212.0402, 2012.

4. **SSv2**:
   > Raghav Goyal, Samira Ebrahimi Kahou, Vincent Michalski, Joanna Materzynska, Susanne Westphal, Heuna Kim, Valentin Haenel, Ingo Freund, Peter Yianilos, Moritz Mueller-Freitag, et al. *The "something something" video database for learning and evaluating visual common sense*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision, pages 5842–5850, 2017.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
