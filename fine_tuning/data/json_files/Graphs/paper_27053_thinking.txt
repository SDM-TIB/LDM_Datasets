To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Sensorimotor representation learning for an 'active self' in robots: A model survey" by Phuong D.H. Nguyen et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a general overview, but the introduction often contains specific references to datasets used in the research.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **experiments**. In many research papers, authors will explicitly list the datasets they used for their experiments, including details about each dataset's purpose, size, and characteristics.

If the paper does not have a dedicated section, I will check the **results and discussion sections** for any mentions of datasets. Authors often refer to datasets when discussing their findings or comparing their results with previous work.

Once I identify the datasets, I will ensure to note down their full citations. This is crucial for proper attribution and for readers who may want to access the datasets themselves.

For example, if the authors mention using the **OpenAI Gym** for reinforcement learning tasks, I would look up the full citation for that resource, which is:
> Brock, A., Donahue, J., & Simonyan, K. (2016). *Large Scale GAN Training for High Fidelity Natural Image Synthesis*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1809.11096.

Similarly, if they reference a dataset like the **ImageNet**, I would find its citation:
> Deng, J., Dong, W., Socher, R., Li, L. J., Li, K., & Fei-Fei, L. (2009). *ImageNet: A Large-Scale Hierarchical Image Database*. In 2009 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (pp. 248-255). IEEE.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation.

Finally, I will format the extracted information into a structured output that can be easily reviewed or processed further.
