To extract datasets from the research paper titled "WhitenedCSE: Whitening-based Contrastive Learning of Sentence Embeddings" by Wenjie Zhuo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments on seven semantic textual similarity tasks, which suggests that there are datasets involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4), where the authors describe their experimental setup. In **Section 4.1 (Experiment Setup)**, they mention that they evaluated their method on seven Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) tasks and seven transfer tasks. This indicates that there are specific datasets used for these tasks.

I will look for the specific names of the datasets in the text. The authors list the datasets used for the STS tasks as follows:

1. **STS 2012**: This dataset is referenced in the context of the STS tasks.
2. **STS 2013**: Another dataset mentioned for the STS tasks.
3. **STS 2014**: Included in the list of datasets for evaluation.
4. **STS 2015**: Also part of the STS tasks.
5. **STS 2016**: The last dataset in the STS series mentioned.
6. **STS Benchmark**: This dataset is referenced as a benchmark for evaluating semantic textual similarity.
7. **SICK-Relatedness**: This dataset is also mentioned for evaluating semantic similarity.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the STS datasets are as follows:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their full citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or processing.
