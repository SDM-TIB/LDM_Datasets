To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DDA: Dimensionality Driven Augmentation Search for Contrastive Learning in Laparoscopic Surgery" by Yuning Zhou et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method across three laparoscopic image classification and segmentation tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 3) where the authors describe their evaluation process. Here, they mention using two datasets for pretraining and downstream evaluations:

1. **SVHM Dataset**: This is a private dataset constructed by the authors, consisting of 70 laparoscopic cholecystectomy videos, yielding 300,000 images. The dataset is described in detail, including its collection process and the diversity of cases.

2. **Cholec80 Dataset**: This is a public dataset containing 400,000 frames from 80 laparoscopic videos, which is also used for pretraining. The authors provide specific details about the dataset's structure and its relevance to their research.

In the **appendices**, the authors provide additional context about the datasets, including their characteristics and the specific tasks they are used for, which reinforces their importance in the study.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to retrieve full citations for these datasets:

- For **SVHM Dataset**, since it is a private dataset created by the authors, it does not have a formal citation. However, I will note its details as provided in the paper.

- For **Cholec80 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Andru P Twinanda, Sherif Shehata, Didier Mutter, Jacques Marescaux, Michel De Mathelin, and Nicolas Padoy. *Endonet: a deep architecture for recognition tasks on laparoscopic videos*. IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging, 2016.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets in a structured format, ensuring to include the full citations where applicable. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.
