To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Bridging the Gap: Attending to Discontinuity in Identification of Multiword Expressions" by Omid Rohanian et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on a "standard multilingual dataset for verbal MWEs," which suggests that there are specific datasets used in their research.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors mention that they experimented with datasets from the "shared task on automatic identification of verbal Multiword Expressions" (Ramisch et al., 2018). This is a crucial point as it directly references a dataset.

In the **data subsection of the experiments section**, the authors specify that they used annotated corpora for four languages: **French (FR), German (DE), English (EN), and Persian (FA)**. They mention that these datasets are tagged for different kinds of verbal MWEs, including idioms, verb particle constructions, and light verb constructions. However, they do not provide specific names for the datasets in this section.

To find the full citations for the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper. The authors reference the shared task on automatic identification of verbal MWEs, which is crucial for identifying the datasets used. The relevant citation is:

- **PARSEME shared task dataset**: 
  > Carlos Ramisch, Silvio Cordeiro, Agata Savary, Veronika Vincze, Verginica Mititelu, Archna Bhatia, Maja Buljan, Marie Candito, Polona Gantar, Voula Giouli, et al. 2018. Edition 1.1 of the PARSEME shared task on automatic identification of verbal multiword expressions. In the Joint Workshop on Linguistic Annotation, Multiword Expressions and Constructions (LAW-MWE-CxG-2018), pages 222â€“240.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the datasets used in the research:

1. **PARSEME shared task dataset**: This dataset includes annotated corpora for multiple languages (French, German, English, and Persian) specifically for the identification of verbal multiword expressions.

With this information, I can now compile the dataset entry into the required format for further processing or review.
