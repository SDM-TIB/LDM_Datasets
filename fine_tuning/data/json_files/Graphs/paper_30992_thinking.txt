To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-scale multi-modal micro-expression recognition algorithm based on transformer" by Fengping Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information accurately, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on **three spontaneous datasets**, which indicates that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention three datasets:

1. **SMIC Dataset**: The authors describe it as the first database containing spontaneous micro-expressions obtained through an emotion elicitation experiment. It includes 164 micro-expression clips from 16 participants.

2. **CASME II Dataset**: This is an improved version of the CASME database, containing 255 micro-expression clips from 26 subjects, classified into seven categories based on facial action units and self-reports.

3. **SAMM Dataset**: This dataset contains 159 micro-expression sequences from 32 participants, classified into seven basic expression categories based on the Facial Action Coding System (FACS).

In the same section, the authors also mention a **combined dataset** that includes samples from all three datasets, which is used for comparative analysis.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **SMIC Dataset**, the citation is:
  > W.-J. Yan, X. Li, S.-J. Wang, G. Zhao, Y.-J. Liu, Y.-H. Chen, X. Fu. *CASME II: An improved spontaneous micro-Expression database and the baseline evaluation*. PLOS ONE, vol. 9, no. 1, pp. e86041, 2014.

- For the **CASME II Dataset**, the citation is:
  > W.-J. Yan, X. Li, S.-J. Wang, G. Zhao, Y.-J. Liu, Y.-H. Chen, X. Fu. *CASME II: An improved spontaneous micro-Expression database and the baseline evaluation*. PLOS ONE, vol. 9, no. 1, pp. e86041, 2014.

- For the **SAMM Dataset**, the citation is:
  > A. K. Davison, C. Lansley, N. Costen, K. Tan, M. H. Yap. *SAMM: A spontaneous micro-facial movement dataset*. IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing, vol. 9, no. 1, pp. 116-129, 2018.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes the full citation as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
