To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Unsupervised Learning for Human Sensing Using Radio Signals" by Tianhong Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the use of RF signals for various computer vision tasks, but it does not specify any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 6 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they refer to two datasets:

1. **RF-MMD**: This dataset is described as an RF-based 3D pose-estimation and action-recognition dataset consisting of 25 hours of RF data with 30 volunteers performing 35 actions in 10 different indoor environments.

2. **RRD**: This dataset is for RF-based person re-identification and contains 863 RF sequences from 100 different identities at 5 different locations on a campus, as well as 6305 RF sequences from 38 different identities in 19 homes.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **RF-MMD**, the citation is:
  > Lijie Fan, Tianhong Li, Mingmin Zhao, Yingcheng Liu, and Dina Katabi. *Making the invisible visible: Action recognition through walls and occlusions*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision, pages 872–881, 2019.

- For **RRD**, the citation is:
  > Lijie Fan, Tianhong Li, Rongyao Fang, Rumen Hristov, Yuan Yuan, and Dina Katabi. *Learning longterm representations for person re-identification using radio signals*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 10699–10709, 2020.

Having gathered the necessary information, I will now prepare to create structured entries for each dataset, ensuring that I include the full citations as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research, ready for further processing or review.
