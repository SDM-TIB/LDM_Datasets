To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Leveraging Self-Supervised Instance Contrastive Learning for Radar Object Detection" by Colin Decourt et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that experiments were conducted on the **CARRADA** and **RADDet** datasets, which suggests these are key datasets for the study.

Next, I will examine **section IV (Experiments)**, where the authors discuss their experimental setup. Here, they explicitly mention using the **CARRADA** and **RADDet** datasets for pre-training and fine-tuning their model. This section will provide more details about the datasets, such as their purpose and characteristics.

In the **CARRADA dataset** description, the authors mention it includes radar data with range-angle-Doppler annotations, which is crucial for understanding its application in radar object detection. The citation for this dataset is:
> A. Ouaknine, A. Newson, J. Rebut, F. Tupin, and P. Pérez. *CARRADA dataset: Camera and automotive radar with range-angle-doppler annotations*. In 2020 25th International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR), 2021, pp. 5068–5075.

For the **RADDet dataset**, the authors describe it as a dataset for range-azimuth-Doppler based radar object detection. The citation for this dataset is:
> A. Zhang, F. E. Nowruzi, and R. Laganiere. *RADDet: Range-azimuth-doppler based radar object detection for dynamic road users*. In 2021 18th Conference on Robots and Vision (CRV), 2021, pp. 95–102.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring that all relevant details are included for further processing or review.
