To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Predicting Path Failure In Time-Evolving Graphs" by Jia Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on a real-world telecommunication network and a traffic network, suggesting that datasets related to these networks are likely included.

Next, I will look into **section 4.1 (Data)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used in their experiments. Here, I will find two datasets:

1. **Telecommunication Network Dataset**: This dataset is derived from a metropolitan LTE transmission network serving 10 million subscribers. It includes data from 626 switches over a period of three months, with features such as sending and receiving power recorded every 15 minutes. The dataset is structured as a time-evolving graph with 853 paths.

2. **Traffic Network Dataset**: This dataset is collected from District 7 of California, involving 4438 sensor stations over three months. It records average speed and average occupancy at an hourly granularity. The dataset also forms a time-evolving graph with 200 sampled paths.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets. However, the paper does not provide specific citations for the datasets themselves, as they are likely proprietary or internal datasets used by the authors. Instead, I will summarize the datasets based on the information provided in the paper.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the names, descriptions, and any relevant details about the datasets, while also noting that full citations are not available due to the nature of the datasets.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for review or further processing, ensuring that all relevant information is clearly presented.
