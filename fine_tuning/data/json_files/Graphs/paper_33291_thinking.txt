To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A multi-layer refined network model for the identification of essential proteins" by Haoyue Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets used for experiments or analysis.

Next, I will focus on the **Methods section**, particularly the subsection titled **3.1 Datasets**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used in their research. Here, I will look for specific names of datasets, their characteristics, and any relevant details that describe their content and purpose.

In this section, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **DIP (Database of Interacting Proteins)**: This dataset contains 4,746 proteins and is used for constructing the protein-protein interaction network.
2. **BioGRID**: This dataset includes 5,616 proteins and is also utilized for the protein-protein interaction network.
3. **DEG (Database of Essential Genes)**: This dataset is referenced for collecting essential proteins.
4. **MIPS (Munich Information Center for Protein Sequences)**: Another source for essential proteins.
5. **SGD (Saccharomyces Genome Database)**: This database is used to identify essential proteins.
6. **SGDP (Saccharomyces Genome Database Project)**: This is also referenced for essential proteins.
7. **GSE3431**: A gene expression profile dataset obtained from the NCBI GEO database, which contains 6,777 proteins.
8. **COMPARTMENTS**: A database providing subcellular localization information for proteins.
9. **CM270, CM425, CYC408, CYC428**: These databases provide information on protein complexes.
10. **InParanoid Version 7**: This database contains orthologous protein information.

After identifying these datasets, I will then check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations I will extract are:

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly presents each dataset along with its full citation, ensuring that all relevant details are included for future reference.
