To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Sy-CON: Symmetric Contrastive Loss for Continual Self-Supervised Representation Learning" by Sungmin Cha and Taesup Moon, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets utilized for their experiments. In this section, they mention using three datasets: **CIFAR-100**, **ImageNet-100**, and **DomainNet**. I will take note of the details provided about each dataset, including their characteristics and how they are used in the experiments.

For **CIFAR-100**, the authors indicate that it is a well-known dataset for image classification tasks, consisting of 60,000 images across 100 classes. 

For **ImageNet-100**, they mention that it is a subset of the larger ImageNet dataset, specifically designed for benchmarking in various tasks, including classification and representation learning.

For **DomainNet**, the authors describe it as a dataset that consists of six disjoint datasets with different source domains, which is used for domain-incremental learning scenarios.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access the datasets.

The citations I will look for are:

- For **CIFAR-100**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton, et al. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. 2009.

- For **ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, and Li Fei-Fei. *Imagenet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In 2009 IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pages 248–255. IEEE, 2009.

- For **DomainNet**, the citation is:
  > Xingchao Peng, Qinxun Bai, Xide Xia, Zijun Huang, Kate Saenko, and Bo Wang. *Moment matching for multi-source domain adaptation*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF international conference on computer vision, pages 1406–1415, 2019.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, which is essential for reproducibility and further research.
