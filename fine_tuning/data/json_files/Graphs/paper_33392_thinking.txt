To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Semi-Supervised Clustering via Structural Entropy with Different Constraints" by Guangjie Zeng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method on **nine clustering datasets** and **four single-cell RNA-seq datasets**, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4) where the authors describe their evaluation methodology. In **Section 4.1**, they mention conducting experiments on five clustering datasets: **Yale**, **ORL**, **COIL20**, **Isolet**, and **OpticalDigits**. I will note these datasets and look for their descriptions and citations.

In **Section 4.2**, the authors discuss experiments on four single-cell RNA-seq datasets: **10X PBMC**, **Mouse bladder**, **Worm neuron**, and **Human kidney**. I will also document these datasets and seek their citations.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. 

1. For the **Yale dataset**, the citation is:
   > Georghiades, A. S., Belhumeur, P. N., & Kriegman, D. J. (2001). *From Few to Many: Illumination Cone Models for Face Recognition under Variable Lighting and Pose*. IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 23(6), 634-640.

2. For the **ORL dataset**, the citation is:

3. For the **COIL20 dataset**, the citation is:

4. For the **Isolet dataset**, the citation is:

7. For the **Mouse bladder dataset**, the citation is:
   > Tian, T., Zhang, J., Lin, X., Wei, Z., & Hakonarson, H. (2021). *Model-based deep embedding for constrained clustering analysis of single cell RNA-seq data*. Nature Communications, 12, 1873.

8. For the **Worm neuron dataset**, the citation is:
   > Tian, T., Zhang, J., Lin, X., Wei, Z., & Hakonarson, H. (2021). *Model-based deep embedding for constrained clustering analysis of single cell RNA-seq data*. Nature Communications, 12, 1873.

9. For the **Human kidney dataset**, the citation is:
   > Tian, T., Zhang, J., Lin, X., Wei, Z., & Hakonarson, H. (2021). *Model-based deep embedding for constrained clustering analysis of single cell RNA-seq data*. Nature Communications, 12, 1873.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
