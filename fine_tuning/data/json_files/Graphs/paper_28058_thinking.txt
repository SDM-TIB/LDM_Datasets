To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Packet Routing with Graph Attention Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning" by Xuan Mai et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research but may not contain specific dataset details. The introduction may provide context or references to datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors discuss their experiments and the network environments they tested their algorithms on. I will pay close attention to any specific datasets or network topologies mentioned.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention two network typologies used for evaluation:

1. **Irregular 6 × 6 grid network**: This is a simulated network topology used to test the performance of their proposed algorithm. The authors describe it in detail, including its structure and how packets are routed through it.

2. **AT&T North America network**: This is a real-world network topology referenced in the experiments. The authors state that they used this network to compare their algorithm against existing benchmarks.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets or network topologies mentioned. However, since the paper primarily discusses simulated environments and a specific real-world network, I will note that the AT&T North America network is referenced as a dataset but does not have a specific citation in the traditional sense. Instead, I will provide the citation for the paper that discusses the Internet topology zoo, which includes the AT&T network:

- For the **AT&T North America network**, the citation is:
  > Knight, S., Nguyen, H. X., Falkner, N., Bowden, R., & Roughan, M. (2011). The internet topology zoo. *IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications*, 29(9), 1765-1775.

Since the irregular 6 × 6 grid network is a simulated environment created for the purpose of this research, it does not have a formal citation.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the AT&T North America network while noting that the irregular grid network is a simulation without a formal citation.
