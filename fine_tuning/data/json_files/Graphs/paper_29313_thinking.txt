To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Lip to Speech Synthesis with Visual Context Attentional GAN" by Minsu Kim et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the proposed method is evaluated on three public benchmark databases, which indicates that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention three datasets:

1. **GRID corpus**: This dataset consists of sentences following a fixed grammar from 33 speakers. The authors evaluate their model in three different settings: constrained-speaker, unseen-speaker, and multi-speaker settings.

2. **TCD-TIMIT**: This dataset is composed of uttering videos from three lip speakers and 59 volunteers. The authors use data from three lip speakers for evaluation in the constrained-speaker setting.

3. **LRW (Lip Reading in the Wild)**: This is a word-level English audio-visual dataset derived from BBC news, containing up to 1,000 training videos for each of 500 words. The dataset presents challenges due to its variety of speakers and poses.

To ensure accuracy, I will check the **References section** for the full citations of these datasets:

- For the **GRID corpus**, the citation is:
  > Martin Cooke, Jon Barker, Stuart Cunningham, and Xu Shao. *An audio-visual corpus for speech perception and automatic speech recognition*. The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America, 120(5):2421–2424, 2006.

- For the **TCD-TIMIT dataset**, the citation is:
  > Naomi Harte and Eoin Gillen. *TCD-TIMIT: An audio-visual corpus of continuous speech*. IEEE Transactions on Multimedia, 17(5):603–615, 2015.

- For the **LRW dataset**, the citation is:
  > Joon Son Chung and Andrew Zisserman. *Lip reading in the wild*. In Asian Conference on Computer Vision, pages 87–103. Springer, 2016.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
