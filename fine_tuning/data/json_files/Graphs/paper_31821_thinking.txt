To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Contrastive Enhanced Slide Filter Mixer for Sequential Recommendation" by Xinyu Du et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that "extensive experiments conducted on five widely used benchmark datasets demonstrate our proposed model performs significantly better than the state-of-the-art approaches." This indicates that multiple datasets are utilized, prompting me to look for their specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly the part where the authors describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they explicitly list the datasets and provide some context about each one. The authors mention:

1. **Beauty Dataset**: Collected from Amazon, this dataset consists of user interactions related to beauty products. It is characterized by high sparsity and a variety of rating review categories.

2. **Clothing Dataset**: Also gathered from Amazon, this dataset includes user interactions with clothing items, similarly marked by high sparsity.

3. **Sports Dataset**: Another Amazon dataset, this one focuses on sports-related products and shares the same sparsity characteristics.

4. **MovieLens-1M Dataset**: This dataset is based on movie reviews collected from the MovieLens website, containing approximately 1 million interactions.

5. **Yelp Dataset**: This dataset consists of transaction records from Yelp, filtered to include only those from after January 1, 2019, and follows a 5-core setting.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

- **Beauty Dataset**: 
  > McAuley, J., Targett, C., Shi, Q., & Van Den Hengel, A. (2015). *Image-based recommendations on styles and substitutes*. In SIGIR (pp. 43-52).

- **Clothing Dataset**: 
  > McAuley, J., Targett, C., Shi, Q., & Van Den Hengel, A. (2015). *Image-based recommendations on styles and substitutes*. In SIGIR (pp. 43-52).

- **Sports Dataset**: 
  > McAuley, J., Targett, C., Shi, Q., & Van Den Hengel, A. (2015). *Image-based recommendations on styles and substitutes*. In SIGIR (pp. 43-52).

- **MovieLens-1M Dataset**: 
  > Harper, F. M., & Konstan, J. A. (2015). *The MovieLens datasets: History and context*. ACM Transactions on Interactive Intelligent Systems (TIIS), 5(4), 1-19.

- **Yelp Dataset**: 
  > Yelp. (2019). *Yelp Dataset Challenge*. Retrieved from https://www.yelp.com/dataset.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
