To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Reconciliation of Pre-trained Models and Prototypical Neural Networks in Few-shot Named Entity Recognition" by Youcheng Huang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract states that the authors conducted experiments based on **nine benchmark datasets**, which indicates that multiple datasets are involved.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of these datasets in the **experiments section**. In this section, the authors list the datasets used for their experiments, which include:

1. **WikiGold**: A dataset for named entity recognition derived from Wikipedia.
2. **CoNLL 2003**: A well-known dataset for named entity recognition tasks.
3. **WNUT 2017**: A dataset focused on novel and emerging entity recognition.
4. **MIT Movie**: A dataset for named entity recognition in movie-related texts.
5. **MIT Restaurant**: A dataset for named entity recognition in restaurant-related texts.
6. **SNIPS**: A dataset for spoken language understanding tasks.
7. **ATIS**: A dataset for airline travel information.
8. **Multiwoz**: A multi-domain task-oriented dialogue dataset.

The authors also mention that these datasets were restructured into a "K-way N-shot" few-shot setting, which is relevant for understanding how they were utilized in the experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
