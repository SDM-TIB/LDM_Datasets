To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Hierarchical Contrastive Learning Enhanced Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network" by Nian Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that "extensive experiments conducted on a variety of real-world networks show the superior performance of the proposed methods," which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this paper, the authors mention using **four public datasets** for their experiments. I will look for specific details about each dataset, including their names, characteristics, and any relevant statistics.

Upon reviewing the text, I find the following datasets mentioned:

1. **ACM Dataset**: This dataset consists of papers, authors, and subjects. The authors note that the target nodes are papers divided into three classes, with an average of 3.33 authors per paper and one subject.

2. **DBLP Dataset**: This dataset includes authors and papers, with authors divided into four classes. Each author has an average of 4.84 papers.

3. **Freebase Dataset**: The target nodes in this dataset are movies, which are categorized into three classes. On average, each movie has 18.7 actors, 1.07 directors, and 1.83 writers.

4. **AMiner Dataset**: This dataset focuses on papers, which are divided into four classes. Each paper has an average of 2.74 authors and 8.96 references.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. However, the paper does not provide specific citations for the datasets themselves, as they are commonly used datasets in the field. Therefore, I will reference the original sources where these datasets can be found or cited.

Now, I will compile the information about each dataset, including their names, descriptions, and any relevant statistics, along with the citations where applicable.

Finally, I will ensure that I format the dataset entries clearly and accurately, ready for any further processing or review.
