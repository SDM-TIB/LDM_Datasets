To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Coupled Tensor Decomposition for Hyperspectral and Multispectral Image Fusion with Inter-Image Variability" by Ricardo A. Borsoi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for experiments. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the research, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **experiments**. In this paper, it is likely that the authors will describe the datasets they used for their experiments in detail. I will pay close attention to any specific names, characteristics, and the context in which these datasets were used.

In the **experiments section**, I will look for any tables or figures that summarize the datasets, as well as any textual descriptions that provide insights into the datasets' properties, such as size, type, and the conditions under which they were collected.

Once I identify the datasets, I will then refer to the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial, as proper citation is necessary for academic integrity and for others to locate the datasets.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like the "AVIRIS dataset," I will look for its citation in the references. If the citation is not directly available, I may need to search for it in other literature or online databases to ensure I have the correct and complete citation.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented.

Finally, I will format the extracted information in a clear and organized manner, ready for further processing or review.
