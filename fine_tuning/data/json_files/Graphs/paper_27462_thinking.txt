To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MBA-VO: Motion Blur Aware Visual Odometry" by Peidong Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and datasets sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions a novel benchmarking dataset for motion blur aware visual odometry, indicating that there are datasets to extract.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Datasets)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used in their experiments. Here, I will identify and summarize each dataset mentioned:

1. **ETH3D / ArchVizInterior**: This dataset is derived from the ETH3D SLAM benchmark, specifically the sequences with severe motion blur. The authors mention that they rendered a synthetic dataset using the Unreal game engine based on the same motion trajectories. This dataset is crucial for their ablation studies.

2. **TUM RGB-D**: The TUM RGB-D dataset is noted for containing hand-held SLAM sequences that also include motion blurred images. The dataset is collected using a Microsoft Xbox Kinect sensor, which is relevant for evaluating the performance of RGBD camera-based SLAM methods.

3. **Proposed Motion Blur Benchmarking Dataset**: The authors introduce their own dataset specifically targeting motion blur. It includes sequences collected with a global shutter camera and provides time-synchronized ground truth trajectories from an indoor motion capturing system.

After identifying these datasets, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **ETH3D SLAM Benchmark**, the citation is:
  > Thomas SchÃ¶ps, Torsten Sattler, and Marc Pollefeys. *BAD SLAM: Bundle adjusted direct RGB-D SLAM*. In Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2019.

- For the **TUM RGB-D dataset**, the citation is:
  > Jurgen Sturm, Nikolas Engelhard, Felix Endres, Wolfram Burgard, and Daniel Cremers. *A benchmark for the evaluation of RGB-D SLAM systems*. In Proc. of the International Conference on Intelligent Robot Systems (IROS), 2012.

- For the **Proposed Motion Blur Benchmarking Dataset**, since it is a new dataset introduced by the authors, I will cite it as follows:
  > Peidong Liu, Xingxing Zuo, Viktor Larsson, and Marc Pollefeys. *Proposed Motion Blur Benchmarking Dataset for Visual Odometry*. 2023. (Note: This citation is hypothetical as the dataset is newly introduced in the paper and may not have a formal citation yet.)

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their descriptions and citations into a structured format for further processing. This ensures that I have accurately captured all necessary information regarding the datasets discussed in the paper.
