To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Visual Encoding and Debiasing for CTR Prediction" by Si Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions "offline experiments on billion-scale datasets," which indicates that there are significant datasets involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4) where the authors describe their evaluations. In **Section 4.1 (Offline Visual Search Evaluation)**, they mention an internal dataset used for visual search tasks. The dataset contains tens of thousands of item images sampled from multiple categories, but they do not provide a specific name or citation for this dataset. I will note this dataset's description but recognize that it lacks a formal citation.

In **Section 4.2 (Offline CTR Evaluation)**, the authors refer to a "billion-scale Taobao dataset" collected from their production system, which spans 15 days and includes 0.4 billion different item images and 1 billion samples. This dataset is crucial for their experiments, and I will ensure to document it properly.

Now, I will check the **References section** to see if there are any citations related to the datasets mentioned. However, the internal dataset does not have a citation, and the Taobao dataset is also not cited in the references. This means I will have to provide a description of the datasets without formal citations.

The datasets identified are:

1. **Internal Dataset**: Contains tens of thousands of item images from various categories, manually annotated for relevance. However, it lacks a formal citation.

2. **Taobao Dataset**: A billion-scale dataset collected from the production system, consisting of 0.4 billion item images and 1 billion samples. This dataset is also not formally cited.

Since both datasets lack formal citations, I will document their descriptions clearly, indicating that they are internal datasets without published references.

Finally, I will compile the dataset descriptions into a structured format that highlights their characteristics, ensuring clarity for future reference or analysis.
