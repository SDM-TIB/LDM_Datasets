To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "GRAMUFEN: Graph-Based Multi-Modal Fake News Detection in Social Media" by Makan Kananian et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant details, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and datasets section** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive evaluations on two publicly available benchmark datasets for social media news, which indicates that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Datasets)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used in their study. Here, they explicitly mention two datasets:

1. **Twitter Dataset**: This dataset is sourced from the MediaEval Verifying Multimedia Use benchmark and is used for detecting fake content on Twitter. It includes tweets with text content, attached images/videos, and social context information. The authors note that they pre-processed the dataset to remove tweets without text or images, resulting in a total of 11,817 tweets after removing duplicates.

2. **Weibo Dataset**: Collected from Weibo social media from 2012 to 2016, this dataset is written in Chinese and contains text, user information, and images. The authors mention that they used only the first image linked to each text and that the dataset is divided into training, validation, and test sets.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Twitter Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Boididou, C., Andreadou, K., Papadopoulos, S., Dang-Nguyen, D.-T., Boato, G., Riegler, M., and Kompatsiaris, Y. (2015). Verifying multimedia use at mediaeval 2015. In MediaEval 2015 Multimedia Benchmark Workshop, volume 1436.

- For the **Weibo Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Jin, Z., Cao, J., Guo, H., Zhang, Y., and Luo, J. (2017). Multimodal fusion with recurrent neural networks for rumor detection on microblogs. In Proceedings of the 25th ACM international conference on Multimedia, pages 795â€“816.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets and their citations clearly.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that is ready for review or further processing.
