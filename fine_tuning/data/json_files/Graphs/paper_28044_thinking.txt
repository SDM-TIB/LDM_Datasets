To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Structure-aware Interactive Graph Neural Networks for the Prediction of Protein-Ligand Binding Affinity" by Shuangli Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted an exhaustive experimental study on two benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved. I will look for specific names or descriptions of these datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 5) where the authors typically provide detailed information about the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they explicitly mention two datasets:

1. **PDBbind**: This is described as a well-known public dataset that provides 3D binding structures of protein-ligand complexes with experimentally determined binding affinities. The authors specify that they used the PDBbind v2016 dataset, which includes three overlapping subsets: general, refined, and core set.

2. **CSAR-HiQ**: This is another benchmark dataset containing two subsets with 176 and 167 protein-ligand complexes. The authors mention using this dataset to evaluate the generalization ability of their model.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

- For **PDBbind**, the citation is:
  > Renxiao Wang, Xueliang Fang, Yipin Lu, Chao-Yie Yang, and Shaomeng Wang. *The PDBbind database: methodologies and updates*. Journal of medicinal chemistry, 48(12):4111–4119, 2005.

- For **CSAR-HiQ**, the citation is:
  > James B Dunbar Jr, Richard D Smith, Chao-Yie Yang, Peter Man-Un Ung, Katrina W Lexa, Nickolay A Khazanov, Jeanne A Stuckey, Shaomeng Wang, and Heather A Carlson. *CSAR benchmark exercise of 2010: selection of the protein–ligand complexes*. Journal of chemical information and modeling, 51(9):2036–2046, 2011.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets in a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as they are essential for proper referencing.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured output that is ready for review or further processing.
