To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Spatial-Temporal Graph Learning with Adversarial Contrastive Adaptation" by Qianru Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to gather initial insights about the datasets used in the research. The abstract mentions that the authors demonstrate the superiority of their proposed method on various real-life datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this paper, there is a **Table 1** that summarizes the statistics of the experimented datasets, which is a key indicator that specific datasets are being utilized.

From the table, I can identify the following datasets:

1. **Chicago Data**: This dataset includes:
   - Boundaries of 234 regions split by streets in a certain district, Chicago.
   - A total of 386,272 taxi trips during a month.
   - A total of 321,876 crime records from January 1, 2016, to December 30, 2017.
   - A total of 3,680,125 POI (Point-of-Interest) locations across 130 categories.
   - A total of 44,447 house price data points in a certain district of Chicago.

2. **NYC Data**: This dataset includes:
   - Boundaries of 180 regions split by streets in Manhattan, New York.
   - A total of 1,445,285 taxi trips during a month.
   - A total of 108,575 crime records from January 1, 2021, to February 24, 2022.
   - A total of 20,569 POI locations across 50 categories.
   - A total of 22,540 house price data points in Manhattan, New York.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. However, the paper does not provide explicit citations for the datasets used. Instead, I will note that the datasets are likely sourced from publicly available datasets or previous studies, which is common in research papers.

Now, I will summarize the datasets with their descriptions and any relevant details:

- For **Chicago Data**, I will note:
  > Chicago Data: Boundaries of 234 regions, 386,272 taxi trips, 321,876 crime records (2016-2017), 3,680,125 POIs, 44,447 house prices.

- For **NYC Data**, I will note:
  > NYC Data: Boundaries of 180 regions, 1,445,285 taxi trips, 108,575 crime records (2021-2022), 20,569 POIs, 22,540 house prices.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that I have accurately captured the datasets and their descriptions as presented in the paper.
