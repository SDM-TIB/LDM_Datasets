To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Hard Negative Sampling Strategies for Contrastive Representation Learning" by Afrina Tabassum et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the introduction of a method called UnReMix and mentions experimental results on several benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for any explicit mentions of datasets. The introduction discusses the challenges in contrastive learning and mentions that the proposed method is verified on several benchmarks, indicating that specific datasets will likely be detailed later in the paper.

I will then look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any relevant sections that describe the datasets used for experiments. In this paper, the authors mention that they verify their method on several visual, text, and graph benchmark datasets. I will need to identify these datasets specifically.

In the **experiments section**, I will look for subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. The authors mention using datasets from various domains, including image, text, and graph data. I will note down the names of these datasets as they are mentioned.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for the datasets used in the experiments.

For example, if the authors mention using the **CIFAR-10** dataset, I will look for its citation, which is typically found in the references. The citation for CIFAR-10 is:
> Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. *CIFAR-10/CIFAR-100 (Canadian Institute for Advanced Research)*. 2009.

Similarly, I will find citations for any other datasets mentioned, such as **BookCorpus** or **IMAGENET-1K**, ensuring that I have the complete reference information for each.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including their names and full citations, into a structured format for easy reference and use in future work.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets used in the research paper, along with their proper citations.
