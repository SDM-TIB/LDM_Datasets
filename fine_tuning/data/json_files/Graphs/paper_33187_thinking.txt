To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Identification of morphological fingerprint in perinatal brains using quasi-conformal mapping and contrastive learning" by Boyang Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and materials and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's goals and methods, which may hint at the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the significance of individual differences in brain structure and function, but I need to look for specific datasets. The **materials and methods section** is crucial, as it typically contains detailed information about the datasets used in the study.

Upon reaching **section 2.1 (Dataset)**, I find a clear description of the dataset used in this study:

1. **Developing Human Connectome Project (dHCP)**: The authors state that imaging data was obtained from the dHCP, which includes structural, diffusion, and functional MRI data from 783 infants. They specify that 682 infants underwent MRI scanning once, while 101 infants were scanned multiple times. The dataset is well-defined, and the authors provide a link to the project for further details.

Next, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the Developing Human Connectome Project. The citation is as follows:

- **Developing Human Connectome Project**: 
  > Makropoulos, A., Robinson, E.C., Schuh, A., Wright, R., Fitzgibbon, S., Bozek, J., Counsell, S.J., Steinweg, J., Vecchiato, K., Passerat-Palmbach, J., and Lenz, G. *The developing human connectome project: A minimal processing pipeline for neonatal cortical surface reconstruction*. Neuroimage 2018, 173, 88-112.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing.

In summary, I have extracted the following dataset from the paper:

- **Dataset Name**: Developing Human Connectome Project (dHCP)
- **Description**: Imaging data from 783 infants, including structural, diffusion, and functional MRI data.
- **Full Citation**: Makropoulos, A., Robinson, E.C., Schuh, A., Wright, R., Fitzgibbon, S., Bozek, J., Counsell, S.J., Steinweg, J., Vecchiato, K., Passerat-Palmbach, J., and Lenz, G. *The developing human connectome project: A minimal processing pipeline for neonatal cortical surface reconstruction*. Neuroimage 2018, 173, 88-112.

With this information, I am ready to format it according to the required structure for downstream processing.
