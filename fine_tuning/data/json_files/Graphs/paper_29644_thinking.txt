To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Contrasting Quadratic Assignments for Set-Based Representation Learning" by Artem Moskalev et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and it may mention datasets used for experiments or evaluations.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this paper, the authors mention using the **CUHK-03 dataset** for instance matching experiments. This dataset is specifically designed for person re-identification tasks, which is relevant to the experiments conducted in the paper.

I will then look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the CUHK-03 dataset. The citation is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the dataset. The reference for the CUHK-03 dataset is:

> Li, W., Zhao, R., Xiao, T., & Wang, X. (2014). DeepReid: Deep Filter Pairing Neural Network for Person Re-Identification. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR) (pp. 152-159).

After identifying the dataset and its citation, I will ensure that I have all the necessary details about the dataset, such as its purpose, size, and any specific characteristics mentioned in the paper.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including the full citation, into a structured format that can be easily reviewed or processed further. This will ensure that all relevant information is captured accurately and comprehensively.
