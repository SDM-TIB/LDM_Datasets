To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Camera-Aware Style Separation and Contrastive Learning for Unsupervised Person Re-Identification" by Xue Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments, which suggests that datasets are involved. 

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of person re-identification (ReID) and the shift towards unsupervised methods, hinting at the use of datasets for evaluation. 

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets and Implementation Details)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention:

1. **Market1501**: This dataset contains 32,668 images of 1,501 identities captured by 6 cameras.
2. **DukeMTMC-reID**: This dataset consists of 36,411 images of 1,404 identities captured by 8 cameras.

Both datasets are commonly used in the field of person re-identification, and their mention in the experiments section confirms their use in the authors' evaluations.

Now, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Market1501**, the citation is:
  > Liang Zheng, Liyue Shen, Lu Tian, Shengjin Wang, Jingdong Wang, and Qi Tian. *Scalable person re-identification: A benchmark*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 1116–1124, 2015.

- For **DukeMTMC-reID**, the citation is:
  > Ergys Ristani, Francesco Solera, Roger S. Zou, Rita Cucchiara, and Carlo Tomasi. *Performance measures and a data set for multi-target, multi-camera tracking*. In ECCV Workshops, pages 17–35, 2016.

Having gathered the necessary information, I will now prepare to create structured entries for each dataset, ensuring that I include the full citations as required. This will allow for proper attribution and facilitate further research or validation of the datasets used in this study.
