To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Evaluating Modularity-Based Community Detection Heuristics" by Samin Aref and Mahdi Mostajabdaveh, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of **104 networks**, including both real-world instances and synthetic benchmarks. This indicates that there are datasets involved, but I need to identify their specific names and details.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **methods** or **results** sections. In this paper, the authors describe the datasets used for their analysis, specifically mentioning **54 real networks** and **50 synthetic networks**. 

I will note the specific datasets mentioned:

1. **Real Networks**: The paper lists 54 real networks, including names like "facebook_friends," "karate," and "dolphins." I will ensure to capture the full list as it appears in the paper.

2. **Synthetic Networks**: The authors mention using two benchmark graph generation models: **LFR (Lancichinetti-Fortunato-Radicchi)** and **ABCD (Artificial Benchmark for Community Detection)**. They describe the parameters used for generating these synthetic graphs, which is important for understanding the datasets.

Now, I will check the **appendix** and **references** sections for any additional details or citations related to these datasets. The appendix provides a list of the real networks and their sources, which I will compile into a structured format. 

For the **LFR and ABCD benchmarks**, I will look for the original papers or sources that describe these datasets to provide proper citations. The paper references the following:

- For **LFR benchmark**:
  > Lancichinetti, A., Fortunato, S., Radicchi, F. (2008). *Benchmark graphs for testing community detection algorithms*. Physical Review E, 78(4), 046110. https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevE.78.046110

- For **ABCD benchmark**:
  > Kamiński, B., Prałat, P., Théberge, F. (2021). *Artificial Benchmark for Community Detection (ABCD)—Fast random graph model with community structure*. Network Science, 9(2), 153–178. https://doi.org/10.1017/nws.2020.45

After gathering all this information, I will compile the datasets into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is accompanied by its full citation. This will include both the real networks and the synthetic benchmarks, along with their respective sources.

Finally, I will ensure that the citations are formatted correctly and are ready for inclusion in any further analysis or documentation.
