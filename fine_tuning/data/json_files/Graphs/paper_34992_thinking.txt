To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Improving classification of road surface conditions via road area extraction and contrastive learning" by Linh Trinh et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on the **public RTK dataset**, which suggests that this dataset is crucial for their research.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section IV) where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used. They state that they used the **CityScapes dataset** for training the segmentation model and the **RTK classification dataset** for simulating road surface condition classification tasks. 

In the **experiments section**, they provide details about the CityScapes dataset, indicating that it was pre-processed to focus on the road class, and they mention the number of samples used for training and validation. They also describe the RTK dataset, which includes three types of road surfaces (asphalt, concrete, and unpaved) and seven distinct road condition classes.

Now, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. **CityScapes Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Cordts, M., Omran, M., Ramos, S., Rehfeld, T., Enzweiler, M., Benenson, R., Franke, U., Roth, S., & Schiele, B. (2016). The Cityscapes dataset for semantic urban scene understanding. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), June 2016.

2. **RTK Classification Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Rateke, T., Justen, K. A., & von Wangenheim, A. (2019). Knowledge (RTK) dataset. Revista de Informática Teórica e Aplicada (RITA).

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

- **CityScapes Dataset**: Used for training the segmentation model, focusing on road class annotations.
- **RTK Classification Dataset**: Contains images of three types of road surfaces with seven distinct condition classes.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all necessary details are captured for future reference or processing.
