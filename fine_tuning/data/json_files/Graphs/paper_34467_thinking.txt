To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Harnessing Collective Structure Knowledge in Data Augmentation for Graph Neural Networks" by Rongrong Ma et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to find any references to datasets. In the abstract, the authors mention conducting experiments on **12 publicly available datasets from the TU-Dataset graph classification benchmark**. This indicates that there are specific datasets used in their research.

Next, I will look closely at **section 5 (Experiments and Results)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the datasets. They mention that they performed experiments on 12 datasets, and they present a table (Table 1) that lists these datasets along with their characteristics.

The datasets mentioned in the paper are:

1. **PROTEINS full**: A dataset for bioinformatics with binary classification.
2. **IMDB-BINARY**: A social network dataset for binary classification.
3. **IMDB-MULTI**: A social network dataset for multi-class classification.
4. **REDDIT-BINARY**: Another social network dataset for binary classification.
5. **REDDIT-MULTI-5K**: A social network dataset for multi-class classification.
6. **MUTAG**: A molecular dataset for binary classification.
7. **NCI1**: A molecular dataset for binary classification.
8. **NCI109**: Another molecular dataset for binary classification.
9. **ENZYMES**: A bioinformatics dataset for multi-class classification.
10. **BZR**: A molecular dataset for binary classification.
11. **COX2**: A molecular dataset for binary classification.
12. **DD**: A bioinformatics dataset for binary classification.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets are typically found in the original papers or sources from which these datasets are derived. 

For example, the citation for the **TU-Dataset** is:
> Morris, C., Kriege, N. M., Bause, F., Kersting, K., Mutzel, P., & Neumann, M. (2020). TUDataset: A collection of benchmark datasets for learning with graphs. ICML 2020 Workshop on Graph Representation Learning and Beyond (GRL+ 2020).

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format that can be used for further analysis or processing.
