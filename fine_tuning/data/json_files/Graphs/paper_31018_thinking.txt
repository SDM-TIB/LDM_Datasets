To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning to Summarize Videos by Contrasting Clips" by Ivan Sosnovik et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's focus on unsupervised video summarization, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** in detail, particularly the subsection labeled **Datasets**. Here, the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments:

1. **TVSum Dataset**: This dataset consists of 50 videos from 10 categories, with frame-level importance scores annotated by 20 users. The scores range from 1 to 5, indicating the importance of each frame.

2. **SumMe Dataset**: This dataset includes 25 short videos of various events, each attributed with frame-level importance scores.

3. **YouTube Highlights Dataset**: This dataset contains around 1000 videos divided into 6 categories, with ground truth highlights provided in the form of sequences of consecutive frames summarizing the content.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **TVSum Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yale Song, Jordi Vallmitjana, Amanda Stent, and Alejandro Jaimes. *TVSum: Summarizing Web Videos Using Titles*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 5179–5187, 2015.

- For the **SumMe Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Michael Gygli, Helmut Grabner, Hayko Riemenschneider, and Luc Van Gool. *Creating Summaries from User Videos*. In European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), pages 505–520, 2014.

- For the **YouTube Highlights Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Min Sun, Ali Farhadi, and Steve Seitz. *Ranking Domain-Specific Highlights by Analyzing Edited Videos*. In Proceedings of the European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), pages 787–802, 2014.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this data into a structured format for further processing or review.
