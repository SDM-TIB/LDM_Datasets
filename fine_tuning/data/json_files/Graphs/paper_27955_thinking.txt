To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Cross-View Saliency Alignment" by Di Wu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. In the abstract, the authors discuss their experiments on "small- and large-scale fine-grained classification benchmarks," which suggests that specific datasets are used, but they are not named yet.

Next, I will look into **section 3 (Experiments)**, where the authors detail the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention several datasets explicitly:

1. **CUB-200-2011**: This dataset contains 11,788 images from 200 wild bird species.
2. **Stanford-Cars**: This dataset includes 16,185 images of 196 car subcategories.
3. **FGVC-Aircraft**: This dataset consists of 10,000 images of 100 classes of aircraft.
4. **NAbirds**: A large dataset with 48,562 images for over 555 bird classes.
5. **iNaturalist2018**: An unbalanced long-tail dataset containing 437,513 images of 8,142 taxa from 14 super-classes.

The authors also mention that they follow the standard dataset partition in the original works, which indicates that these datasets are well-established in the research community.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **CUB-200-2011**, the citation is:
  > Wah, C., Branson, S., Welinder, P., Perona, P., & Belongie, S. (2011). The Caltech-UCSD Birds-200-2011 dataset.

- For **Stanford-Cars**, the citation is:

- For **FGVC-Aircraft**, the citation is:

- For **NAbirds**, the citation is:
  > Van Horn, G., Branson, S., Farrell, R., Haber, S., Barry, J., Ipeirotis, P., Perona, P., & Belongie, S. (2015).

In Proceedings of the Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR) (pp. 595-604).

- For **iNaturalist2018**, the citation is:
  > Van Horn, G., Mac Aodha, O., Song, Y., Cui, Y., Sun, C., Shepard, A., Adam, H., Perona, P., & Belongie, S. (2018). The iNaturalist species classification and detection dataset. In Proceedings of the Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR) (pp. 2010-2018).

After gathering all this information, I will summarize the datasets and their citations in a structured format for easy reference. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations for future use.
