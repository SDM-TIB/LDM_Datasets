To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Skeleton-based Hand-Gesture Recognition with Lightweight Graph Convolutional Networks" by Hichem Sahbi, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract states that experiments were conducted on the task of skeleton-based hand-gesture recognition, which suggests that a dataset is likely involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 3) where the author discusses the database and settings. Here, the paper explicitly mentions the use of the **First-Person Hand Action (FPHA) dataset**. The dataset is described as containing 1,175 skeletons belonging to 45 action categories performed by 6 different individuals in 3 scenarios. This is a clear indication of the dataset's relevance to the experiments conducted.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the FPHA dataset. The citation provided in the references is:
> G. Garcia-Hernando, S. Yuan, S. Baek, and T.-K. Kim. *First Person Hand Action Benchmark with RGB-D Videos and 3D Hand Pose Annotations*. In CVPR, 2018.

Since this is the only dataset mentioned in the paper, I will document it accordingly.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This will ensure that all necessary details are captured for future reference or processing.

In summary, I have identified the **First-Person Hand Action (FPHA) dataset** as the primary dataset used in the research, and I have retrieved its full citation from the references section. This completes the extraction process for datasets from this paper.
