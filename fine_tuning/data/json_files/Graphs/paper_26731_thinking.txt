To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Visual Analytics Framework for Contrastive Network Analysis" by Takanori Fujiwara et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that the authors demonstrate the usefulness of their framework with **two case studies using real-world datasets**. This indicates that datasets are present, but I need to find their specific names.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology or case studies** sections. In the introduction, the authors discuss the comparative analysis of networks, which suggests that specific datasets are used for this purpose.

Upon reviewing the **case studies** section, I find that the authors explicitly mention two datasets:

1. **Dolphin Social Network**: This dataset is referenced as a target network in one of the case studies. It is a well-known dataset used for analyzing social interactions among dolphins.
   
2. **Zachary's Karate Club Network**: This dataset serves as the background network in the same case study. It is a classic dataset used in social network analysis to study group dynamics.

Now, I will check the **References section** to obtain the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For the **Dolphin Social Network**, the citation is:
  > D. Lusseau, K. Schneider, O. J. Boisseau, P. Haase, et al. *The bottlenose dolphin community of Doubtful Sound features a large proportion of long-lasting associations*. Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology, 54(4):396–405, 2003.

- For **Zachary's Karate Club Network**, the citation is:
  > W. W. Zachary. *An information flow model for conflict and fission in small groups*. Journal of Anthropological Research, 33(4):452–473, 1977.

With these citations in hand, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
