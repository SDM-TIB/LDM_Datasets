To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Partial and Asymmetric Contrastive Learning for Out-of-Distribution Detection in Long-Tailed Recognition" by Haotao Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors benchmark their method on long-tailed datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be referenced.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this paper, they mention using three long-tailed image classification datasets: **CIFAR10-LT**, **CIFAR100-LT**, and **ImageNet-LT**. I will take note of the details provided about each dataset, including their characteristics and any relevant statistics.

In the **experiments section**, the authors specify that:
1. **CIFAR10-LT** is a long-tailed version of the CIFAR10 dataset, which has an imbalance ratio of 100.
2. **CIFAR100-LT** is similarly a long-tailed version of the CIFAR100 dataset, also with an imbalance ratio of 100.
3. **ImageNet-LT** is a long-tailed version of the ImageNet dataset.

I will also check the **references section** for full citations of these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and understanding the datasets' origins.

The citations I will extract are:
- For **CIFAR10-LT**:
  > Cao, K., Wei, C., Gaidon, A., Arechiga, N., & Ma, T. (2019). Learning imbalanced datasets with label-distribution-aware margin loss. In NeurIPS, pp. 1567–1578.

- For **CIFAR100-LT**:
  > Cao, K., Wei, C., Gaidon, A., Arechiga, N., & Ma, T. (2019). Learning imbalanced datasets with label-distribution-aware margin loss. In NeurIPS, pp. 1567–1578.

- For **ImageNet-LT**:
  > Liu, Z., Miao, Z., Zhan, X., Wang, J., Gong, B., & Yu, S. X. (2019). Large-scale long-tailed recognition in an open world. In CVPR, pp. 2537–2546.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I capture all relevant details about the datasets used in the research paper.
