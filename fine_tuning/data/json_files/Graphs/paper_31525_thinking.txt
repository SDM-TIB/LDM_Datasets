To extract datasets from the research paper titled "FEND: A Future Enhanced Distribution-Aware Contrastive Learning Framework for Long-tail Trajectory Prediction" by Yuning Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the challenges of trajectory prediction and hints at the use of datasets, but I need to confirm the specific datasets used.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they mention:

1. **ETH-UCY Dataset**: A pedestrian dataset known for its rich social interactions, which is commonly used in trajectory prediction research.

2. **Nuscenes Dataset**: A large-scale dataset that includes both vehicles and pedestrians, utilized in the context of vehicle trajectory prediction.

3. **SDD (Stanford Drone Dataset)**: Another large-scale bird's-eye view trajectory dataset that is referenced for evaluation.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **ETH-UCY Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Alexandre Alahi, Kratarth Goel, Vignesh Ramanathan, Alexandre Robicquet, Li Fei-Fei, and Silvio Savarese. *Social LSTM: Human Trajectory Prediction in Crowded Spaces*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 961–971, 2016.

- For the **Nuscenes Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Holger Caesar, Varun Bankiti, and et al. *nuScenes: A Multimodal Dataset for Autonomous Driving*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 11621–11631, 2020.

- For the **SDD (Stanford Drone Dataset)**, the citation is:
  > Serhiy Korolev, et al. *Stanford Drone Dataset*. Available at: https://cvgl.stanford.edu/projects/stanford_drones/dataset.html.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
