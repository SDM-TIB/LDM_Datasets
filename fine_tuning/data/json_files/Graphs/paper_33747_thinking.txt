To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Graph Feature Preprocessor: Real-time Extraction of Subgraph-based Features from Transaction Graphs" by Jovan Blanuša et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their library using **synthetic anti-money laundering (AML) datasets** and a **real-life Ethereum phishing dataset**. This suggests that there are specific datasets that I need to look for.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental setup section** where the authors provide details about the datasets used in their evaluation. In this section, they mention several datasets, including:

1. **AML HI Small**: A synthetic dataset with a higher illicit rate.
2. **AML HI Medium**: Another synthetic dataset with a higher illicit rate.
3. **AML HI Large**: A larger synthetic dataset with a higher illicit rate.
4. **AML LI Small**: A synthetic dataset with a lower illicit rate.
5. **AML LI Medium**: Another synthetic dataset with a lower illicit rate.
6. **AML LI Large**: A larger synthetic dataset with a lower illicit rate.
7. **ETH Phishing**: A real-world dataset containing Ethereum transactions labeled as phishing.

The paper provides a table (Table 1) that summarizes the datasets, including the number of nodes, edges, illicit rate, and time span for each dataset. This information is crucial for a comprehensive description of each dataset.

Now, I will extract the full citations for each dataset mentioned. The citations are typically found in the **References section** of the paper. The authors reference the synthetic AML datasets as being produced by the **AMLworld generator** and provide a link to the dataset. For the ETH Phishing dataset, they cite a source that provides access to the dataset.

Here are the full citations for the datasets:

- **AML Datasets**: 
  > Erik Altman, Jovan Blanuša, Luc von Niederhäusern, Béni Egressy, Andreea Anghel, and Kubilay Atasu. *Realistic Synthetic Financial Transactions for Anti-Money Laundering Models*. In Thirty-seventh Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems Datasets and Benchmarks Track. https://openreview.net/forum?id=XZf2bnMBag

- **ETH Phishing Dataset**: 
  > Liang Chen, Jiaying Peng, Yang Liu, Jintang Li, Fenfang Xie, and Zibin Zheng. *XBLOCK Blockchain Datasets: InPlusLab Ethereum Phishing Detection Datasets*. http://xblock.pro/ethereum/.

With this information, I can now compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described accurately and includes the necessary citations. This structured approach will help in organizing the extracted data for further analysis or processing.
