To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Het-node2vec: second order random walk sampling for heterogeneous multigraphs embedding" by Giorgio Valentini et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the algorithms introduced, but it may not specify datasets directly. Therefore, I will focus on the introduction and methodology sections for any explicit mentions of datasets used in the experiments.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the relevance of heterogeneous networks in various fields but do not mention specific datasets. I will then check the **experiments section** for any references to datasets used for validation or testing of their proposed algorithms.

Upon reviewing the **experiments section**, I find that the authors mention using the **KG-COVID-19** dataset for their experiments. This dataset is relevant as it pertains to the application of their algorithms in the context of COVID-19 knowledge graphs.

Next, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citation for the KG-COVID-19 dataset. The authors reference the dataset in the context of their experiments, and I will ensure to capture the complete citation.

The citation for the KG-COVID-19 dataset is:
> J. Reese, U. Deepak, T. Callahan, et al. *KG-COVID-19: A framework to produce customized knowledge graphs for COVID-19 response*. Patterns, page 100155, 2021. doi: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.patter.2020.100155.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This includes ensuring that the dataset name, description, and citation are clearly articulated.
