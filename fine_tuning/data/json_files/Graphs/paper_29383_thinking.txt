To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Gated Multimodal Fusion with Contrastive Learning for Turn-Taking Prediction in Human-Robot Dialogue" by Jiudong Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions the collection of a "large-scale annotated corpus for turn-taking with over 5,000 real human-robot dialogues," which indicates that a dataset is indeed present. The introduction further emphasizes the lack of public multimodal datasets for turn-taking, reinforcing the importance of the dataset mentioned.

Next, I will focus on the **dataset section (Section 2)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset they collected. Here, they describe the dataset as being derived from a commercial conversational IVR system, consisting of 5,380 dialogues that include both endpointing and barge-in situations. This section provides crucial details about the dataset's characteristics, such as the dialogue length, the nature of the interactions, and the methods used for data collection and annotation.

In this section, I will note the following key points about the dataset:
- The dataset includes over 5,000 dialogues between customers and an intelligent robot.
- It covers both endpointing and barge-in scenarios.
- The dialogues are manually transcribed, providing both speech and text information.
- The dataset is annotated for turn-taking decisions, with a substantial inter-annotator agreement score.

After gathering this information, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. However, the authors do not provide a separate citation for their dataset since it is a new contribution. Instead, I will note that the dataset is original and created by the authors of this paper.

Now, I will summarize the dataset information as follows:
1. **Human-Robot Dialogue Corpus**: This dataset consists of 5,380 dialogues collected from a commercial conversational IVR system, focusing on turn-taking prediction in human-robot interactions.

Since there is no external citation for this dataset, I will indicate that it is a novel dataset introduced in this paper.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format that captures all the necessary details, ensuring that the information is clear and ready for any further processing or review.
