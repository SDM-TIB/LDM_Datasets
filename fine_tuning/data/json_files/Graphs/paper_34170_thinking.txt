To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Adaptive Intra-Class Variation Contrastive Learning for Unsupervised Person Re-Identification" by Lingzhi Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **experiments section (Section 4)**, the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for evaluation. They state that they evaluate their method on two large-scale person re-identification benchmarks: **Market-1501** and **MSMT17**. This is a clear indication that these datasets are crucial for their experiments.

Next, I will look for detailed descriptions of these datasets within the same section. The paper provides the following information:

1. **Market-1501 Dataset**: This dataset consists of 32,668 annotated images of 1,501 identities captured from 6 different cameras. The training set includes 12,936 images of 751 identities, while the test set contains 19,732 images of 750 identities.

2. **MSMT17 Dataset**: This is the largest dataset mentioned, containing 126,441 bounding boxes of 4,101 identities taken by 12 outdoor and 3 indoor cameras. The training set has 32,621 images of 1,041 identities, and the test set includes 93,820 images of 3,060 identities.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **Market-1501**, the citation is:
  > Liang Zheng, Liyue Shen, Lu Tian, Shengjin Wang, Jingdong Wang, and Qi Tian. *Scalable person re-identification: A benchmark*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 1116–1124, 2015.

- For **MSMT17**, the citation is:
  > Zhun Zhong, Liang Zheng, Donglin Cao, and Shaozi Li. *Re-ranking person re-identification with k-reciprocal encoding*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 1318–1327, 2017.

With this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations as required. This structured approach ensures that I accurately capture all relevant details about the datasets used in the research.
