To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Contrastive Learning-based Imputation-Prediction Networks for In-hospital Mortality Risk Modeling using EHRs" by Yuxi Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on **two real-world EHR datasets**, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets and Tasks)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they state that they validated their approach on the **MIMIC-III** and **eICU** datasets. I will take note of these names and any relevant details provided about them.

In this section, the authors also reference the literature for detailed information on both datasets. This is a good indication that I should check the references to find the full citations for these datasets.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the complete citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. For the **MIMIC-III dataset**, the citation is:
   > Johnson, A.E.W., Pollard, T.J., Shen, L., Li-Wei, H.L., Feng, M., Ghassemi, M., Moody, B., Szolovits, P., Celi, L.A., Mark, R.G. (2016). *MIMIC-III, a freely accessible critical care database*. Scientific data, 3(1), 1–9.

2. For the **eICU dataset**, the citation is:
   > Pollard, T.J., Johnson, A.E.W., Raffa, J.D., Celi, L.A., Mark, R.G., Badawi, O. (2018). *The eICU collaborative research database, a freely available multi-center database for critical care research*. Scientific data, 5(1), 1–13.

With these citations in hand, I can now summarize the datasets extracted from the paper, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that is ready for review or further processing.
