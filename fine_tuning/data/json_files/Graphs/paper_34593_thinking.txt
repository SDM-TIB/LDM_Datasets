To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Personalized Topic Selection Model for Topic-Grounded Dialogue" by Shixuan Fan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention the use of datasets for evaluating their proposed method. I will look for specific names of datasets or references to previous works that might indicate the datasets used.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, particularly **subsection 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors typically provide detailed information about the datasets used in their experiments. Here, I find two datasets explicitly mentioned:

1. **TG-ReDial**: This dataset consists of 10,000 two-party dialogues structured in a topic-guided manner, with a total of 129,392 dialogue utterances. It is specifically designed for target-guided topic-grounded dialogue.

2. **Persona-Chat**: This dataset contains 9,935 dialogues and is used for open-domain conversations. It includes 147,039 utterances and is structured to cover a broad range of topics.

Now, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

- For **TG-ReDial**, the citation is:
  > Zhou, K., Zhao, Z., & Wang, Y. (2020). *Towards topic-guided conversational recommender system*. In Proceedings of the 28th International Conference on Computational Linguistics (COLING 2020), pages 4128–4139.

- For **Persona-Chat**, the citation is:
  > Zhang, S., Dinan, E., Urbanek, J., Szlam, A., Kiela, D., & Weston, J. (2018). *Personalizing dialogue agents: I have a dog, do you have pets too?* In Proceedings of the 56th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL 2018), pages 2204–2213.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will help maintain clarity and ensure that all necessary details are captured for future reference or processing.
