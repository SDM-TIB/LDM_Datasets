To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Dataset for Learning Graph Representations to Predict Customer Returns in Fashion Retail" by Jamie McGowan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors present a novel dataset collected by ASOS to predict customer returns, which suggests that this dataset is central to their research.

Next, I will examine **section 2 (Data Description)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset. They introduce the **ASOS GraphReturns dataset**, which contains purchase and return records, including anonymous customer and product variant information. The dataset is organized into unique customers and product variants, with labeled purchase events indicating whether a product was returned or not.

In this section, the authors specify that the training dataset includes approximately 770,000 unique customers and 410,000 product variants, with a total of 1.4 million purchase events. This detailed description confirms the dataset's structure and purpose.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the ASOS GraphReturns dataset. The authors mention that the dataset can be found at a specific URL: https://osf.io/c793h/. However, since this is a dataset created by the authors themselves, I will treat the paper as the primary source for citation purposes.

The full citation for the dataset is:
> Jamie McGowan, Elizabeth Guest, Ziyang Yan, Zheng Cong, Neha Patel, Mason Cusack, Charlie Donaldson, Sofie de Cnudde, Gabriel Facini, and Fabon Dzogang. 2023. A Dataset for Learning Graph Representations to Predict Customer Returns in Fashion Retail. In Sixteenth ACM Conference on Recommender Systems (FashionXRecSys ’22), September 18–23, 2022, Seattle, WA, USA. ACM, New York, NY, USA, 6 pages. https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-22192-7_6

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the key details of the **ASOS GraphReturns dataset**:

1. **Dataset Name**: ASOS GraphReturns
2. **Description**: A dataset containing purchase and return records from ASOS, organized into unique customers and product variants, with labeled purchase events indicating returns.
3. **Size**: Approximately 770,000 unique customers and 410,000 product variants, with 1.4 million purchase events.
4. **Link**: https://osf.io/c793h/

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that the full citation is included for the dataset.
