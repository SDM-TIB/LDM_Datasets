To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Medical Entity Disambiguation Using Graph Neural Networks" by Alina Vretinaris et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their method on "five real-world datasets," which indicates that multiple datasets are involved. I will look for specific names or descriptions of these datasets.

Next, I will navigate to **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, I will find detailed descriptions of each dataset, including their characteristics and the context in which they are used.

The datasets mentioned in this section are:

1. **MDX**: A medical knowledge base containing information about drugs, adverse effects, indications, findings, etc. It is manually curated from medical literature.

2. **MIMIC-III**: A public dataset containing 40,000 anonymized patient health-related records, including demographics, laboratory test results, medications, and diagnoses.

3. **Bio CDR**: A dataset consisting of 1,500 PubMed abstracts annotated with mentions of chemicals, diseases, and relations between them.

4. **NCBI**: A dataset comprising 700 PubMed abstracts annotated with disease mentions and their corresponding concepts in MeSH.

5. **ShARe**: A dataset that includes 433 anonymized clinical notes obtained from the MIMIC II clinical dataset, annotated with disorder mentions.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations for the datasets are:

Now that I have gathered the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
