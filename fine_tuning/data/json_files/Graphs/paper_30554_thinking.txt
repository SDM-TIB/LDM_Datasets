To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Adaptive Speech Quality Aware Complex Neural Network for Acoustic Echo Cancellation with Supervised Contrastive Learning" by Bozhong Liu, Xiaoxi Yu, and Hantao Huang, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions a model trained with 72 hours of data, which suggests that datasets are involved, but I need to find specific names and details.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss various approaches to acoustic echo cancellation, but they do not mention specific datasets. I will continue to the **methodology** section, where they describe their approach in detail.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**. Here, the authors state that they used a total of 90 hours of audio, with 72 hours for training and 18 hours for validation. They mention using clean speech from multilingual data provided by a reference [12]. This indicates that there is a dataset involved, but I need to find the exact name and citation.

The authors also describe how they generated far-end and near-end audio, mentioning the use of an impulse response (IR) dataset. They refer to the IR dataset as containing real and simulated impulse responses, which is another dataset to note.

I will now check the **References section** to gather full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. For the multilingual dataset used for generating far-end and near-end audio, the citation is:
   > C. K. Reddy, H. Dubey, V. Gopal, R. Cutler, S. Braun, H. Gamper, R. Aichner, and S. Srinivasan. *ICASSP 2021 Deep Noise Suppression Challenge*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP), pages 6623–6627, 2021.

2. For the impulse response dataset, the citation is:
   > J. B. Allen and D. A. Berkley. *Image method for efficiently simulating small-room acoustics*. The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America, vol. 65, no. 4, pp. 943–950, 1979.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research paper along with their full citations.
