We collected facial videos, pulse waves, HRs, and respiratory waves from the subjects. Facial videos were captured simultaneously using two devices: a Logitech C920n HD PRO webcam and a Google Pixel 5 smartphone. Pulse waves were acquired using the wearable sensor E4 wristband and utilized as supervised labels to train DL models (not for our method but for the comparative methods). HRs were obtained by the OxyTrue A pulse oximeter and used as the ground-truth for evaluating the HR estimation performance. Respiratory waves were acquired by the RIP respiratory sensor and used as supervised labels (for comparative methods) and as the ground-truth for evaluating the RR estimation performance.",
