To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Graph Clustering via Mutual Information Maximization and Mixture Model" by Maedeh Ahmadi et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that the experiments are conducted on "real-world datasets," which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section IV (Experiments)**, where the authors typically provide information about the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, the authors explicitly mention two datasets:

1. **Cora Dataset**: This dataset is described as a citation network with 2,708 nodes (papers) and 5,429 edges (citations). The features are binary vectors, and there are 7 clusters.

2. **Pubmed Dataset**: This dataset is also a citation network, consisting of 19,717 nodes and 44,338 edges. The features are represented by tf-idf weights, and there are 3 clusters.

To ensure I have the correct details, I will also check the **table summarizing the dataset statistics** in section IV, which confirms the information about the Cora and Pubmed datasets.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The Cora and Pubmed datasets are commonly used in the literature, so I will reference their original sources:

- For the **Cora Dataset**, the citation is:
  > M. McCallum, K. Nigam, "A comparison of event models for Naive Bayes text classification," in Proceedings of the AAAI-98 Workshop on Learning for Text Categorization, 1998.

- For the **Pubmed Dataset**, the citation is:
  > P. Chen, S. Redner, "Community structure of the physical review citation network," Journal of Informetrics, vol. 4, no. 3, pp. 278â€“290, 2010.

With this information, I can now compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
