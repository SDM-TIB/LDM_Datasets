To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Long-Tail Session-based Recommendation from Calibration" by Jiayi Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that experiments were conducted on benchmark datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed present. I will look for specific names or descriptions of these datasets.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors typically provide detailed information about the datasets used in their experiments. In this section, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, characteristics, and any relevant statistics.

Upon reviewing section 4.1, I find that the authors used two datasets:

1. **YOOCHOOSE**: This dataset is described as having 8,326,407 clicks, 5,917,745 training sessions, 55,898 test sessions, 29,618 items, and an average session length of 5.71.

2. **Last.fm**: This dataset has 3,835,706 clicks, 2,837,644 training sessions, 672,519 test sessions, 38,615 items, and an average session length of 9.19.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. 

For the **YOOCHOOSE dataset**, the citation is:
> YOOCHOOSE. *RecSys Challenge 2015 Dataset*. Available at: http://2015.recsyschallenge.com/challenge.html.

For the **Last.fm dataset**, the citation is:
> Last.fm. *Last.fm 1K Dataset*. Available at: http://ocelma.net/MusicRecommendationDataset/Last.fm-1K.html.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will summarize the information for each dataset, ensuring to include the dataset name, description, and full citation.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that can be easily reviewed or processed further. This will ensure that all relevant details about the datasets are captured accurately and comprehensively.
