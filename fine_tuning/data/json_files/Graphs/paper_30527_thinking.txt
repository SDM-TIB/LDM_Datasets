To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Discourse-Aware Emotion Cause Extraction in Conversations" by Dexin Kong et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, but I will need to delve deeper into the body of the paper for specific dataset mentions.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of emotion cause extraction in conversations and reference prior work, but I need to look for explicit dataset names or descriptions.

Next, I will examine **section 4 (Experiments)**, which is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention using the **RECCON dataset** and the **STAC dataset** for their experiments. 

1. **RECCON Dataset**: The authors state that they used the Fold1 dataset generated by a negative sampling strategy for their experiments. They provide specific numbers for training, validation, and testing data, which indicates the dataset's structure and size.

2. **STAC Dataset**: This dataset is mentioned as being used to assist in training the auxiliary task of discourse parsing. The authors provide details about the number of conversations, elementary discourse units (EDUs), and discourse relations present in the dataset.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **RECCON dataset**, the citation is:
  > Poria, S., Majumder, N., Hazarika, D., Ghosal, D., Bhardwaj, R., Bai Jian, S. Y., Hong, P., Ghosh, R., Roy, A., Chhaya, N., & others. (2021). Recognizing emotion cause in conversations. *Cognitive Computation*, 13(5), 1317–1332. Springer.

- For the **STAC dataset**, the citation is:
  > Afantenos, S., Kow, É., Asher, N., & Perret, J. (2015). Discourse parsing for multi-party chat dialogues. In *Proceedings of the 2015 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing* (pp. 928–937).

Having gathered this information, I will now compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations. This will ensure that the datasets are accurately represented and properly cited for future reference.
