To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Analysis of different temporal graph neural network configurations on dynamic graphs," I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the use of benchmark datasets for temporal graph neural networks (TGNs), which indicates that datasets are likely discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Datasets)**, as this section is explicitly dedicated to the datasets used in the project. Here, I will look for specific names, descriptions, and any relevant details about the datasets that are utilized for the experiments.

In section 3, the authors mention two datasets:

1. **EnglandCovid Dataset**: This dataset is used to analyze the spread of COVID-19 in England's NUTS3 regions over a period of 61 days. It is collected from smartphones with location history enabled and includes data points aggregated from three times of the day. The dataset consists of 129 regions, with each region represented as a node in the graph.

2. **Wikipedia Dataset**: This dataset is used to study continuous-time dynamic graph models. It includes 30 days of edits made by users on the 1000 most edited Wikipedia pages, resulting in a total of 8227 users and 157,474 interactions. The features of each interaction are derived from the text edits converted into a LIWC-feature vector.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. 

For the **EnglandCovid Dataset**, the citation is:
> Panagopoulos, George, Giannis Nikolentzos, and Michalis Vazirgiannis. "Transfer graph neural networks for pandemic forecasting." Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence. Vol. 35. No. 6. 2021.

For the **Wikipedia Dataset**, the citation is:
> Xu, Da, et al. "Inductive representation learning on temporal graphs." arXiv preprint arXiv:2002.07962 (2020).

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their respective citations from the research paper.
