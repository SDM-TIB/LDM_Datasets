To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Framework for Partially Observed Reward-States in RLHF" by Chinmaya Kausik et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, and the introduction typically outlines the context and significance of the work, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. This is often where authors describe the datasets used for their experiments, including details about their size, structure, and purpose.

In this paper, I will specifically look for any references to datasets used in the context of reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). If the authors mention any datasets, I will take note of their names and any relevant details provided.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like "Human Feedback Dataset," I will look for its citation in the references. If the dataset is derived from another source, I will ensure to cite the original source as well.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is clearly documented.

Finally, I will summarize the findings in a structured format, ready for further processing or review.
