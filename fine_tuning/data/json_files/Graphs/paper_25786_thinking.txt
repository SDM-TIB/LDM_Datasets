To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Algorithms for Semantic Segmentation of Multispectral Remote Sensing Imagery using Deep Learning" by Ronald Kemker, Carl Salvaggio, and Christopher Kanan, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors present a new dataset called **RIT-18**, which is a significant clue that I should focus on this dataset.

Next, I will look for specific sections that detail the datasets used. In this case, the **introduction** mentions the RIT-18 dataset and its purpose for evaluating semantic segmentation frameworks. I will also check the **experiments** and **results sections** to confirm the dataset's usage and any comparisons made with other datasets.

In the **section 4 (RIT-18 Dataset)**, the authors provide a comprehensive description of the dataset, including its resolution, the number of classes, and the collection parameters. They state that RIT-18 consists of high-resolution multispectral imagery collected by an unmanned aircraft system (UAS) and is designed for semantic segmentation tasks.

I will also check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper references several other datasets, including:

1. **ISPRS Vaihingen Dataset**:

6. **Kaggle Challenge Dataset**:

Now, I will compile the information about the RIT-18 dataset and the other datasets into a structured format, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. 

After gathering all the necessary details, I will prepare the dataset entries for review or further processing.
