To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Tackling Spoofing-Aware Speaker Verification with Multi-Model Fusion" by Haibin Wu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will look for any references to datasets used in the experiments.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges in automatic speaker verification (ASV) and mention the SASV challenge, which hints at the datasets involved. I will pay close attention to any specific datasets mentioned in this section.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experimental setup)**, where the authors detail the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention two key datasets:

1. **ASVspoof 2019 Dataset**: This dataset is crucial for the spoofer detection task and is described as containing bona fide speech trials collected from the VCTK corpus, along with spoofer attack trials synthesized by various methods. The dataset is partitioned into training, development, and evaluation sets, with specific numbers of speakers and trials detailed.

2. **VoxCeleb2 Dataset**: This dataset is used for training the ASV models and is described as containing audio clips collected from YouTube, with a total of 1,092,009 utterances from 5,994 speakers.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **ASVspoof 2019 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Xin Wang, Junichi Yamagishi, Massimiliano Todisco, HÂ´ector Delgado, Andreas Nautsch, Nicholas Evans, Md Sahidullah, Ville Vestman, Tomi Kinnunen, Kong Aik Lee, et al. "ASVspoof 2019: A large-scale public database of synthesized, converted and replayed speech." *Computer Speech & Language*, vol. 64, pp. 101114, 2020.

- For the **VoxCeleb2 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Joon Son Chung, Arsha Nagrani, and Andrew Zisserman. "Voxceleb2: Deep speaker recognition." arXiv preprint arXiv:1806.05622, 2018.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all relevant details are accurately captured for further processing or review.
