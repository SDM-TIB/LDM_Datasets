To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Uncertainty in Graph Contrastive Learning with Bayesian Neural Networks" by Alexander MÃ¶llers et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the use of "semi-supervised node-classification tasks," which suggests that datasets are involved, but I need to find specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they mention using three widely-used citation networks for predicting article subject categories: **Cora**, **CiteSeer**, and **Pubmed**. This is a clear indication that these datasets are central to their experiments.

I will then look for a **dedicated datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **appendices**. In Appendix A, the authors provide additional details about the datasets, confirming that:

1. **Cora**: Consists of 2,708 scientific publications, with edges representing citation links and features as a sparse bag-of-words for each node.
2. **CiteSeer**: Comprises 3,327 scientific publications, similarly structured.
3. **Pubmed**: Contains 19,717 scientific publications, also following the same structure.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets are typically found in the context of their original publications. The authors reference the following works:

- For **Cora**: 
  > Yang, Y., Yoon, J., & Cohen, W. (2016). *Revisiting semi-supervised learning with graph embeddings*. In Proceedings of the 33rd International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML), 2016.

- For **CiteSeer**: 
  > Sen, P., Namata, G. E., Bilgic, M., Getoor, L., & Gallagher, B. (2008). *Collective classification in network data*. AI Magazine, 29(3), 93-106.

- For **Pubmed**: 
  > Yang, Y., Yoon, J., & Cohen, W. (2016). *Revisiting semi-supervised learning with graph embeddings*. In Proceedings of the 33rd International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML), 2016.

Even though the Cora and Pubmed datasets are cited from the same source, I will ensure to document them separately as they are distinct datasets.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant information regarding the datasets used in the research paper.
