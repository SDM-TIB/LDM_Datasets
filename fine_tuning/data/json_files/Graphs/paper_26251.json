This dataset consists of 145 × 145 pixels with a spatial resolution of 20 m × 20 m, and there are 220 spectral channels covering the range from 0.4 µm to 2.5 µm. As a usual step, 20 water absorption and noisy bands are removed, and the remaining 200 bands are retained. The original ground truth of the Indian Pines dataset includes 16 land-cover classes.",
