To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Temporal and Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network for Financial Time Series Prediction" by Dawei Cheng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments on stock markets in the United States and China, which suggests that datasets related to these markets are likely included.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention using historical price data from the **S&P 500** and **CSI 300** indices. This indicates that these two datasets are central to their research.

I will then look for specific details about these datasets, such as the time period covered and the nature of the data. The authors specify that they used historical price data from **2016 to 2021** for both indices, which is crucial information to include.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. However, in this case, the datasets are standard financial indices, and the authors do not provide specific papers for these datasets. Instead, I will cite the official sources for these indices:

1. **S&P 500 Index**: 
   > S&P Dow Jones Indices. *S&P 500 Index*. Available at: https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/indices/equity/sp-500/

2. **CSI 300 Index**: 
   > China Securities Index Co., Ltd. *CSI 300 Index*. Available at: http://www.cffex.com.cn/en_new/CSI300IndexOptions.html

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will prepare to format this information according to the required structure for downstream processing. 

In summary, the datasets extracted from the paper are:

1. **S&P 500 Index**: Historical price data from 2016 to 2021.
   - Citation: S&P Dow Jones Indices. *S&P 500 Index*. Available at: https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/indices/equity/sp-500/

2. **CSI 300 Index**: Historical price data from 2016 to 2021.
   - Citation: China Securities Index Co., Ltd. *CSI 300 Index*. Available at: http://www.cffex.com.cn/en_new/CSI300IndexOptions.html

With this information, I am ready to compile the dataset entries for further use.
