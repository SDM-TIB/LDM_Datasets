To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Realistic Synthetic Social Networks with Graph Neural Networks" by Alex Davies and Nirav Ajmeri, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are mentioned or implied. The abstract discusses the generation of synthetic networks and mentions the use of empirical evaluation, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will look for specific sections that typically contain dataset information, such as **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe their methodology and the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention sampling several large networks published by Rozemberczki et al. and provide details about the datasets used.

I will pay particular attention to **Table 1**, which summarizes the characteristics of the sampled datasets, including Facebook, GitHub, Twitch, and Deezer. Each dataset is described with key metrics such as the number of networks, minimum and maximum nodes, and density.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. The references section provides the necessary details for these citations:

1. **Facebook Dataset**: The dataset is sourced from the Stanford SNAP repository, which is referenced as:
   > Jure Leskovec and Andrej Krev. *SNAP Datasets: Stanford Large Network Dataset Collection*. 2014.

2. **GitHub Dataset**: This dataset is also from the Stanford SNAP repository, and the citation is the same as for the Facebook dataset:
   > Jure Leskovec and Andrej Krev. *SNAP Datasets: Stanford Large Network Dataset Collection*. 2014.

3. **Twitch Dataset**: The Twitch dataset is similarly sourced from the Stanford SNAP repository, with the same citation:
   > Jure Leskovec and Andrej Krev. *SNAP Datasets: Stanford Large Network Dataset Collection*. 2014.

4. **Deezer Dataset**: The Deezer dataset is referenced from Rozemberczki et al.:
   > B. Rozemberczki, R. Davies, R. Sarkar, and C. Sutton. *GemSec: Graph embedding with self clustering*. In Proceedings of the 2019 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Advances in Social Networks Analysis and Mining, ASONAM 2019, pp. 65â€“72, 2019.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
