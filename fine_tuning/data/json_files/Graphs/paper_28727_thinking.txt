To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Semi-Supervised Contrastive Learning for Remote Sensing: Identifying Ancient Urbanization in the South-Central Andes" by Jiachen Xu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and data sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study involves a significant number of unlabeled and labeled images, which suggests that datasets are present.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of detecting archaeological features using satellite imagery and mention the use of a large dataset of images. This prompts me to look for specific dataset details in the methods and data sections.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Data and Experiments)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the datasets used:

1. **Labeled Dataset**: The paper mentions a labeled dataset consisting of **5,830 labeled images** that were used for training, validation, and testing. This dataset is crucial for evaluating the performance of their proposed model.

2. **Unlabeled Dataset**: The authors also describe an unlabeled dataset comprising **95,358 unlabeled images** collected from WorldView 2 and WorldView 3 satellite constellations. This dataset is significant for the semi-supervised learning approach they propose.

In the **data subsection**, the authors elaborate on how the images were collected, processed, and labeled. They mention that the labeled images were categorized into two classes: "ancient building" and "no ancient building," which is essential for understanding the dataset's context.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. However, the datasets themselves (i.e., the unlabeled and labeled images) do not have specific citations since they are original data collected for this study. Instead, I will note the source of the imagery:

- **WorldView 2 and WorldView 3 Satellite Imagery**: The imagery used in this study was provided by the Digital Globe Foundation.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the context and details about the datasets as described in the paper. This will help in creating a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.
