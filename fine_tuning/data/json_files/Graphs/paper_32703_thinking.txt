To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Dynamic Pricing of Applications in Cloud Marketplaces using Game Theory" by Safiye Ghasemi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to identify any datasets that are explicitly referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview, but the introduction and experimental sections are likely to contain more detailed information about the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the competitive nature of cloud marketplaces and the need for effective pricing strategies, but they do not mention specific datasets at this point. I will continue to the **experimental setup** section, where the authors describe their methodology and the parameters used for their experiments.

In **section 5.1 (Experimental Setup)**, the authors mention that they used a semi-cloud computing marketplace and refer to the CloudSim toolkit for their simulations. They also provide details about the parameters and configurations used in their experiments, including the types of virtual machines (VMs) and applications considered. However, they do not explicitly name any datasets.

Next, I will check the **references section** to see if any datasets are cited in the context of previous research or methodologies. The references include various studies related to cloud computing and pricing strategies, but I need to determine if any of these references correspond to datasets.

Upon reviewing the references, I find that the authors cite several papers that may contain relevant datasets, but they do not provide specific dataset names or citations in the main text of their paper. This indicates that the authors may have used data from existing literature or simulations rather than publicly available datasets.

Since no specific datasets are mentioned in the paper, I will summarize the findings as follows:

1. **CloudSim Toolkit**: The authors utilized the CloudSim toolkit for their experiments, which is a simulation framework for modeling cloud computing environments. While this is not a dataset per se, it is a tool that allows for the generation of synthetic data for cloud simulations.

2. **Microsoft CRM Applications**: The authors refer to various Microsoft CRM applications and their costs in Table 4, but again, this is not a dataset in the traditional sense. It provides pricing information rather than a structured dataset.

3. **Virtual Machine Parameters**: The parameters of VMs are listed in Table 3, which includes attributes such as size, memory, and pricing. This information is useful for understanding the experimental setup but does not constitute a dataset.

Since the paper does not provide specific datasets or their citations, I will conclude that there are no formal datasets extracted from this research paper. Instead, the authors rely on simulation data generated through the CloudSim toolkit and reference existing literature for context.

In summary, I will document the findings as follows:
- No specific datasets were identified in the paper.
- The CloudSim toolkit was used for simulations, generating synthetic data.
- Pricing information for Microsoft CRM applications was provided but does not constitute a dataset.

This approach ensures that I have thoroughly examined the paper for any datasets while adhering to the importance of providing full citations where applicable.
