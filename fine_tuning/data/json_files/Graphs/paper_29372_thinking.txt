To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Self-Supervised Lesion Recognition for Breast Ultrasound Diagnosis" by Yuanfan Guo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses a multi-task framework for lesion recognition and classification, but does not specify any datasets. 

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly **section 3.1 (Data and Implementation Details)**, where the authors describe the dataset used for their experiments. Here, they mention that they evaluated their method on an **in-house breast ultrasound dataset** containing a total of **5,911 images from 2,131 lesions**, with a breakdown of **2,002 images being benign and 3,909 malignant**. This dataset is crucial for understanding the context of their experiments.

Since the dataset is described as an in-house dataset, I will need to note that it may not have a formal citation like publicly available datasets. However, I will still document it as follows:

1. **In-house Breast Ultrasound Dataset**: This dataset consists of 5,911 images from 2,131 lesions, with 2,002 benign and 3,909 malignant images. The dataset is used for training and evaluating the proposed method.

Next, I will check the **References section** to see if there are any citations related to the dataset. However, since the dataset is in-house, it is unlikely to have a formal citation. Instead, I will note that the dataset is not publicly available and is specific to the authors' research.

Finally, I will compile the information about the dataset into a structured format, ensuring that I include the details about the dataset and its context within the research. 

In summary, the key steps I will take are:
1. Identify the relevant sections of the paper that discuss datasets.
2. Extract the details of the in-house dataset mentioned in the experiments section.
3. Note the absence of a formal citation for the in-house dataset.
4. Prepare the dataset entry for documentation.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately capture the dataset information from the paper while adhering to the importance of proper citation where applicable.
