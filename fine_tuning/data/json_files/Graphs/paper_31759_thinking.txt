To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Simulation-Augmented Benchmarking Framework for Automatic RSO Streak Detection in Single-Frame Space Images" by Zhe Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors developed a framework that uses simulated images to augment the dataset for training detectors, which suggests that there are datasets involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Benchmarking Framework)**, particularly **subsection 2.2 (RSO Streak Detection and Swarm Data)**, where the authors discuss the Swarm dataset. They mention that the Swarm satellite constellation provides images taken from onboard star trackers, which are crucial for RSO detection. The authors state that they collected a total of **63 images** with at least one clear streak, annotated manually, from the Swarm dataset.

In addition, I will look for any references to synthetic datasets generated by their simulator. The authors mention that they generated **400 synthetic images** containing clear simulated streaks to augment the original dataset. This is important as it indicates the creation of a new dataset for training purposes.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. **Swarm Dataset**: The authors refer to the Swarm satellite images processed by Feiteirinha et al. The citation is:
   > Feiteirinha, J. L. F., Kairis, V., Reggestad, V., Flohrer, T., Maleville, L., Siminski, J., & Maestroni, E. (2019). Str4sd - exploring the concept of opportunistically using star-trackers for space debris observations. In ESA Space Safety Programme Office, The 1st NEO and Debris Detection Conference.

2. **Synthetic Dataset**: The synthetic images generated by the authors do not have a specific citation since they created them as part of their methodology. However, I will note that they are part of the proposed simulation-augmented benchmarking framework.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

- **Swarm Dataset**: Contains 63 annotated images with RSO streaks, collected from the Swarm satellite constellation.
- **Synthetic Dataset**: Comprises 400 simulated images generated to augment the training dataset for RSO detection.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
