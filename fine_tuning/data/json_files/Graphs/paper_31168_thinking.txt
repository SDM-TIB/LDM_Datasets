To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Detecting Contextomized Quotes in News Headlines by Contrastive Learning" by Seonyeong Song et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors propose a dataset for the detection problem, which indicates that a dataset is indeed present.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors discuss the importance of direct quotations in news articles and the problem of contextomy. They mention that they release a dataset for the detection problem based on guidelines constructed by annotators with journalism expertise. This suggests that the dataset is specifically designed for their research.

In the **methods section**, the authors describe their data collection process, stating that they gathered a nationwide corpus of Korean news articles published through Naver, which contains around 0.4 million news stories. They also mention that they randomly sampled 2,000 news articles for manual annotation, resulting in a final dataset comprising 814 contextomized and 786 modified samples, totaling 1,600 samples. This provides specific details about the dataset's size and composition.

I will also check the **conclusion** and **acknowledgment sections** for any additional information about the dataset. The acknowledgment section mentions that the dataset was put together by a specific individual, which may be relevant for citation purposes.

Now, I will compile the full citations for the datasets mentioned in the paper. The authors do not provide a formal citation for the dataset they created, but I can reference the paper itself as the source of the dataset. The citation for the paper is:

> Seonyeong Song, Hyeonho Song, Kunwoo Park, Jiyoung Han, and Meeyoung Cha. *Detecting Contextomized Quotes in News Headlines by Contrastive Learning*. In Proceedings of the [Conference Name], [Year].

Since the dataset is hosted on GitHub, I will also include the link to the dataset repository:

> Dataset available at: https://github.com/ssu-humane/contextomized-quote-contrastive.

In summary, I will document the following dataset information:

1. **Dataset Name**: Contextomized Quotes Dataset
   - **Description**: A dataset for detecting contextomized quotes in news headlines, containing 1,600 samples (814 contextomized and 786 modified).
   - **Citation**: Seonyeong Song, Hyeonho Song, Kunwoo Park, Jiyoung Han, and Meeyoung Cha. *Detecting Contextomized Quotes in News Headlines by Contrastive Learning*. In Proceedings of the [Conference Name], [Year].
   - **Link**: https://github.com/ssu-humane/contextomized-quote-contrastive.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for further processing or review.
