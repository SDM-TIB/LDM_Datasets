To extract datasets from the research paper titled "COCO: Coherence-Enhanced Machine-Generated Text Detection Under Low Resource With Contrastive Learning" by Xiaoming Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their method on **two public datasets and two self-constructed datasets**, which suggests that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section (Section 4)**, specifically **subsection 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they mention:

1. **GROVER Dataset**: This dataset consists of human-written texts (HWTs) collected from RealNews and machine-generated texts (MGTs) produced by the Grover-Mega model. The dataset is designed for MGT detection tasks.

2. **GPT-2 Dataset**: This dataset is derived from the Webtext dataset provided by OpenAI, containing HWTs from WebText and MGTs generated by the GPT-2 model.

3. **GPT-3.5 Dataset**: This dataset is self-constructed by the authors using the text-davinci-003 model from OpenAI. It includes HWTs from various newspapers and MGTs generated by the same model.

The authors also mention that they created two subsets of the GPT-3.5 dataset: **mixed-provenance and unmixed-provenance**, which are used for further analysis.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **GROVER Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Zellers, R., Holtzman, A., Rashkin, H., Bisk, Y., Farhadi, A., & Choi, Y. (2019). Defending against neural fake news. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS).

- For the **GPT-2 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Radford, A., Wu, J., Child, R., Luan, D., Amodei, D., & Sutskever, I. (2019). Language models are unsupervised multitask learners. OpenAI Blog.

- For the **GPT-3.5 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Ouyang, L., Wu, J., Jiang, X., Almeida, D., Wainwright, C., Mishkin, P., Zhang, C., Agarwal, S., Slama, K., Ray, A., et al. (2022). Training language models to follow instructions with human feedback. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS).

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented and properly cited.
