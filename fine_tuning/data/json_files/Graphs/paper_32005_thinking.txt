To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Channel and Gradient-Importance Aware Device Scheduling for Over-the-Air Federated Learning" by Yuchang Sun et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the proposed method is evaluated on two image classification datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **introduction**. The authors discuss the use of MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets for their experiments, which gives me the names of the datasets I need to focus on.

I will then check the **experiments section** to confirm the details about these datasets. The authors describe the MNIST dataset as containing ten classes of 60,000 training samples and the CIFAR-10 dataset as containing ten classes of 50,000 training samples. This provides me with essential information about the datasets.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

1. **MNIST Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Yann LeCun, Léon Bottou, Yoshua Bengio, and Patrick Haffner. *Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition*. Proceedings of the IEEE, 86(11):2278–2324, 1998.

2. **CIFAR-10 Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. [Online]. Available: https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html.

Now that I have the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.

In summary, the steps I took include:
1. Reading the abstract and introduction to identify datasets.
2. Confirming dataset details in the experiments section.
3. Retrieving full citations from the references section.
4. Compiling the information for structured output.
