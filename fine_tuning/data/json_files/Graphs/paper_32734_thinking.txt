To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Enhancing Student Performance Prediction on Learnersourced Questions with SGNN-LLM Synergy" by Lin Ni et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors validated their approach across **five real-world datasets sourced from the PeerWise platform**, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly the **Dataset Background and Introduction** subsection. Here, the authors explicitly list the five datasets used for their experiments:

1. **Biology Dataset**: This dataset includes 761 students, 380 multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and 76,613 links, with a link positivity percentage of 66.5%.

2. **Law Dataset**: This dataset consists of 528 students, 5,600 MCQs, and 88,563 links, with a link positivity percentage of 93.1%.

3. **Cardiff Dataset**: Sourced from Cardiff University School of Medicine, it has 383 students, 1,171 MCQs, and 64,524 links, with a link positivity percentage of 60.0%.

4. **Sydney1 Dataset**: This dataset includes 382 students, 457 MCQs, and 24,032 links, with a link positivity percentage of 53.1%.

5. **Sydney2 Dataset**: This dataset consists of 198 students, 748 MCQs, and 24,050 links, with a link positivity percentage of 70.6%.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset. However, the paper does not provide specific citations for the datasets themselves, as they are sourced from the PeerWise platform. Therefore, I will note that the datasets are derived from PeerWise and provide a general citation for the platform.

The citation for the PeerWise platform is:
> Denny, P., Luxton-Reilly, A., & Hamer, J. (2008). The PeerWise system of student contributed assessment questions. In Proceedings of the tenth conference on Australasian computing education-Volume 78, 69â€“74. Citeseer.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the general citation for the PeerWise platform as the source for all datasets.

In summary, I will create entries for each dataset, noting their characteristics and the overarching citation for the PeerWise platform, which serves as the source for these datasets.
