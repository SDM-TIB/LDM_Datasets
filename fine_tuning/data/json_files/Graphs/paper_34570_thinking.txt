To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SelfGNN: Self-Supervised Graph Neural Networks for Sequential Recommendation" by Yuxi Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that extensive experiments were conducted on **four real-world datasets**, which indicates that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In the **experiments section (4.1.1)**, the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments:

1. **Amazon-book**: This dataset records users’ ratings of Amazon books in 2014.
2. **Gowalla**: This dataset is a user geolocation check-in dataset from Gowalla in 2010.
3. **Movielens**: This dataset contains users’ ratings for movies from 2002 to 2009.
4. **Yelp**: This dataset consists of venue reviews sampled from 2009 to 2019.

The paper also mentions that they applied a 5-core setting to ensure that each user and item has at least five interactions, which is important for understanding the dataset's structure.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **Amazon-book**, the citation is:
  > Ruining He and Julian McAuley. *Ups and Downs: Modeling the Visual Evolution of Fashion Trends with One-Class Collaborative Filtering*. In Proceedings of the 25th International World Wide Web Conference (WWW), pages 507–517, 2016.

- For **Gowalla**, the citation is:
  > Eunjoon Cho, Seth A. Myers, and Jure Leskovec. *Friendship and mobility: user movement in location-based social networks*. In Proceedings of the 17th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD), pages 1082–1090, 2011.

- For **Movielens**, the citation is:
  > F. Maxwell Harper and Joseph A. Konstan. *The MovieLens Datasets: History and Context*. ACM Transactions on Interactive Intelligent Systems (TIIS), 5(4):1–19, 2015.

- For **Yelp**, the citation is:
  > J. Zhang, Y. Zhu, Q. Liu, S. Wu, S. Wang, and L. Wang. *Mining latent structures for multimedia recommendation*. In Proceedings of the 29th ACM International Conference on Multimedia (MM), pages 3872–3880, 2021.

With this information, I can now summarize the datasets and their citations accurately.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that is ready for review or downstream processing, ensuring that each dataset is clearly identified along with its full citation.
