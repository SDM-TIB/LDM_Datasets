To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Contrastive Self-Distillation for Ultra-Fine-Grained Visual Categorization Targeting Limited Samples" by Ziye Fang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the proposed method, CSDNet, has been evaluated on several datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed present in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental setup section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this case, the authors mention evaluating CSDNet on **nine datasets**, specifically five ultra-fine-grained datasets and four fine-grained datasets. 

I will look for a **table or a list** that summarizes the datasets, which is often included in the experimental details. In this paper, there is a table (Table I) that provides statistics about the datasets, including the number of classes, training samples, and testing samples. The datasets mentioned are:

1. **Cotton80**: 80 classes, 240 training samples.
2. **SoyLocal**: 200 classes, 600 training samples.
3. **SoyGene**: 1,110 classes, 12,763 training samples.
4. **SoyAgeing**: 198 classes, 4,950 training samples.
5. **SoyGlobal**: 1,938 classes, 5,814 training samples.
6. **CUB-200-2011**: 200 classes, 5,994 training samples.
7. **Food101**: 101 classes, 75,750 training samples.
8. **IP102**: 102 classes, 45,095 training samples.
9. **Apple Foliar disease**: 4 classes, 1,366 training samples.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. 

For example, I will look for the following citations:

- **Cotton80**: The citation may refer to a specific study or dataset release that describes the dataset in detail.
- **SoyLocal**: Similarly, I will find the original source or publication that introduced this dataset.
- **SoyGene**: I will check for the citation that provides the details of this dataset.
- **SoyAgeing**: I will look for the relevant citation.
- **SoyGlobal**: I will find the citation for this dataset.
- **CUB-200-2011**: This dataset is well-known, and I will ensure to include its citation.
- **Food101**: This dataset is also widely used, and I will find its citation.
- **IP102**: I will locate the citation for this dataset.
- **Apple Foliar disease**: I will find the citation for this dataset.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described with its name, number of classes, number of training samples, and the full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for easy reference and further processing.
