To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Classic GNNs are Strong Baselines: Reassessing GNNs for Node Classification" by Yuankai Luo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate classic GNN models across 18 diverse datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experimental Setup for Node Classification)**, where the authors provide a summary of the datasets used. This section includes a table (Table 1) that lists various datasets along with their characteristics, such as the number of nodes, edges, features, classes, and the type of graph (homophilous or heterophilous).

From Table 1, I will extract the following datasets:

1. **Cora**: A citation network with 2,708 nodes and 5,201 edges, used for node classification.
2. **CiteSeer**: Another citation network with 3,327 nodes and 4,732 edges.
3. **PubMed**: A larger citation network with 19,717 nodes and 44,324 edges.
4. **Computer**: A co-purchase network with 13,752 nodes and 245,861 edges.
5. **Photo**: Another co-purchase network with 7,650 nodes and 119,081 edges.
6. **CS**: A co-authorship network with 18,333 nodes and 81,894 edges.
7. **Physics**: A co-authorship network with 34,493 nodes and 247,962 edges.
8. **WikiCS**: A Wikipedia-based benchmark with 11,701 nodes and 216,123 edges.
9. **Squirrel**: A page-page network with 5,201 nodes and 2,277 edges.
10. **Chameleon**: Another page-page network with 2,089 nodes and 2,325 edges.
11. **Roman-Empire**: A dataset with 500 nodes and 300 edges.
12. **Amazon-Ratings**: A product co-purchase dataset with 10,000 nodes and 39,402 edges.
13. **Minesweeper**: A synthetic dataset with 1,000 nodes and 1,000 edges.
14. **Questions**: A user interaction dataset with 1,000 nodes and 1,000 edges.
15. **ogbn-proteins**: A large-scale graph with 132,534 nodes and 39,561,252 edges.
16. **ogbn-arxiv**: Another large-scale graph with 169,343 nodes and 1,166,243 edges.
17. **ogbn-products**: A large-scale graph with 2,449,029 nodes and 61,859,140 edges.
18. **pokec**: A social network graph with 1,632,803 nodes and 30,622,564 edges.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The paper mentions that the datasets Cora, CiteSeer, and PubMed are widely used citation networks, and I will look for their original papers:

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations for further processing.
