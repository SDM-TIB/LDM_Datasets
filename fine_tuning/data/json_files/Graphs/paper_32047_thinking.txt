To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Topic-Guided Sampling For Data-Efficient Multi-Domain Stance Detection" by Erik Arakelyan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract mentions evaluating the method on a benchmark of **16 datasets**, which indicates that multiple datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used in their study. They mention that the benchmark consists of **16 individual datasets** split into four source groups: Debates, News, Social Media, and Various. The specific datasets mentioned include:

1. **arc**: A dataset related to claims and evidence in debates.
2. **argmin**: A dataset for stance detection.
3. **emergent**: A dataset for stance classification.
4. **fnc1**: A dataset from the Fake News Challenge for stance detection.
5. **iac1**: A dataset for ideological debates.
6. **ibmcs**: A dataset for claims stance detection.
7. **mtsd**: A dataset for multi-target stance detection.
8. **perspectrum**: A dataset for stance detection across diverse perspectives.
9. **poldeb**: A dataset for political debates.
10. **rumor**: A dataset for rumor stance detection.
11. **scd**: A dataset for stance classification in social media.
12. **semeval2016t6**: A dataset from SemEval for stance detection in tweets.
13. **semeval2019t7**: A dataset from SemEval for stance detection.
14. **snopes**: A dataset for fact-checking and stance detection.
15. **vast**: A dataset for stance detection in various contexts.
16. **wtwt**: A dataset for stance detection on Twitter.

In the **appendices**, the authors provide statistics for these datasets, which will help in understanding their scope and scale.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations will typically include the authors, title of the work, conference or journal name, and publication year. For example, the citation for the **arc dataset** is:

- **arc**: Aharoni, E., Polnarov, A., Lavee, T., Hershcovich, D., Levy, R., Rinott, R., Gutfreund, D., & Slonim, N. (2014). A Benchmark Dataset for Automatic Detection of Claims and Evidence in the Context of Controversial Topics. In Proceedings of the First Workshop on Argumentation Mining, pages 64â€“68, Baltimore, Maryland. Association for Computational Linguistics.

I will repeat this process for each dataset mentioned in the paper to ensure I have the complete and accurate citations.

Finally, I will compile all the dataset information, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, into a structured format that can be easily reviewed or processed further.
