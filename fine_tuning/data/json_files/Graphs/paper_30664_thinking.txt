To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Comprehensive Analysis of Over-Smoothing in Graph Neural Networks from Markov Chains Perspective" by Weichen Zhao et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to identify any datasets that are mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and it may mention specific datasets used for experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used in their evaluations. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, characteristics, and any relevant details about how they were used in the experiments.

In this paper, I notice that the authors mention several datasets in the experimental results. Specifically, they refer to:

1. **Cora**: A well-known citation network dataset used for node classification tasks.
2. **Citeseer**: Another citation network dataset similar to Cora, also used for node classification.
3. **Pubmed**: A dataset derived from PubMed articles, used for similar classification tasks.
4. **ogbn-arxiv**: A dataset from the Open Graph Benchmark, specifically for graph-based learning tasks.
5. **ogbg-molhiv**: A dataset from the Open Graph Benchmark focused on molecular graphs.
6. **ogbg-ppa**: Another dataset from the Open Graph Benchmark, used for graph-based learning.

I will then check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for these datasets. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access the datasets.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

- **Cora**:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and attributed correctly. This structured approach will help in accurately extracting and presenting the datasets used in the research paper.
