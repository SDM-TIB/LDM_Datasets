To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Meta-GPS++: Enhancing Graph Meta-Learning with Contrastive Learning and Self-Training" by Yonghao Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract and introduction** sections of the paper. These sections often provide a high-level overview of the research and may mention the datasets used. In this case, the introduction discusses the need for datasets in few-shot node classification tasks, indicating that datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will navigate to the **experiments section**, specifically looking for a subsection that discusses the datasets used. In this paper, the authors provide a detailed description of the datasets in **section 5.1 (Dataset)**. Here, they mention six datasets used for their experiments, which are crucial for understanding the context of their research.

The datasets mentioned are:

1. **Reddit**: A collection of posts from the Reddit forum, forming a post-to-post graph. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Julian McAuley, Rahul Pandey, and Jure Leskovec. *Inferring networks of substitutable and complementary products*. In ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, 2015.

2. **ogbn-products**: A co-purchasing network developed by the Open Graph Benchmark (OGB). The citation for this dataset is:
   > Hu, W., Fey, M., Zitnik, M., Dong, Y., Ren, H., Liu, M., Catasta, M., & Leskovec, J. *Open Graph Benchmark: Datasets for Machine Learning on Graphs*. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 2020.

3. **Amazon-Clothing**: A network of products from the Amazon categories of Clothing, Shoes, and Jewelry. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Julian McAuley, Rahul Pandey, and Jure Leskovec. *Inferring networks of substitutable and complementary products*. In ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, 2015.

4. **Cora-Full**: A complete version of the Cora dataset, forming a paper citation network. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Bojchevski, A., & Günnemann, S. *Deep Gaussian Embedding of Graphs: Unsupervised Inductive Learning via Ranking*. In International Conference on Learning Representations, 2017.

5. **Amazon-Electronics**: A subset of Amazon’s Electronics products. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Julian McAuley, Rahul Pandey, and Jure Leskovec. *Inferring networks of substitutable and complementary products*. In ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, 2015.

6. **DBLP**: A citation network treating papers as nodes and their citation links as edges. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Tang, J., Zhang, J., Yao, L., Li, J., Zhang, L., & Su, Z. *Arnetminer: Extraction and mining of academic social networks*. In ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, 2008.

After identifying these datasets, I will ensure to note down their descriptions and citations accurately. This will allow me to compile a comprehensive list of datasets used in the research, complete with proper citations.

Finally, I will summarize the findings in a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly identified along with its citation, ready for further processing or review.
