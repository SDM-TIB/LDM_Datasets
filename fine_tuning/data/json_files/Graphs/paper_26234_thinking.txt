To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning to Manipulate Object Collections Using Grounded State Representations" by Matthew Wilson and Tucker Hermans, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and while it may not detail specific datasets, it may hint at their existence.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 5) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for training and evaluation. In this section, I will look for any references to datasets, including their names, sizes, and any specific characteristics that are relevant to the research.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention collecting a dataset of **1 million transitions** for training their model. However, they do not specify a named dataset in the traditional sense, as this dataset appears to be generated from their own simulation environment rather than a publicly available dataset.

Since the paper does not reference any external datasets, I will note that the dataset used is a custom dataset created for the purpose of this research. I will also check the **References section** to see if any datasets are cited there, but it appears that the focus is primarily on the methodology and results rather than established datasets.

Given this analysis, I will document the dataset as follows:

1. **Custom Dataset for Training**: This dataset consists of 1 million transitions collected during the training phase, specifically designed for the experiments conducted in this research.

Since there are no external datasets cited, I will provide the citation for the paper itself as the source of this dataset:

- Wilson, M., & Hermans, T. (2019). Learning to Manipulate Object Collections Using Grounded State Representations. In *Proceedings of the 3rd Conference on Robot Learning (CoRL 2019)*, Osaka, Japan.

Now, I will compile this information into a structured format that captures the essence of the dataset used in the research.
