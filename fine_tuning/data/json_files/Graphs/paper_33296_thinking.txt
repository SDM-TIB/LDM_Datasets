To extract datasets from the research paper titled "TaskMet: Task-Driven Metric Learning for Model Learning" by Dishank Bansal et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors validate their approach through experiments in two main settings: portfolio optimization and reinforcement learning. This suggests that datasets related to these tasks may be present.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **introduction**. The authors discuss various applications of task-based learning, but I need to find explicit dataset names or references.

In the **experiments section**, particularly in **section 4**, the authors describe their experimental setup. They mention using three standard resource allocation tasks: portfolio optimization, budget allocation, and model-based reinforcement learning. I will check if they provide specific datasets for these tasks.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors reference the following datasets:

1. **Cubic Dataset**: This dataset is used for evaluating methods under model mismatch scenarios, where the model being learned suffers from severe approximation error. The authors describe it as a synthetic dataset generated by a cubic function.

2. **Budget Allocation Dataset**: This dataset involves predicting click-through rates (CTRs) for users on various websites. The authors do not provide a specific citation for this dataset, but it is implied to be a standard dataset used in the literature.

3. **Portfolio Optimization Dataset**: The authors refer to historical stock data for predicting future stock prices. Again, no specific citation is provided, but it is a common dataset used in financial modeling.

Next, I will check the **References section** for any citations related to these datasets. However, it appears that the authors do not provide formal citations for the datasets they use, as they are standard datasets in the field.

Since the paper does not provide full citations for the datasets, I will note that the datasets are commonly used in the literature but lack specific references. I will summarize the datasets as follows:

- **Cubic Dataset**: A synthetic dataset generated by a cubic function for evaluating model performance under approximation errors.
- **Budget Allocation Dataset**: A dataset for predicting click-through rates (CTRs) on websites, commonly referenced in decision-focused learning literature.
- **Portfolio Optimization Dataset**: Historical stock data used for predicting future stock prices, widely used in financial modeling.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity, ensuring that I highlight the lack of formal citations for the datasets mentioned in the paper.
