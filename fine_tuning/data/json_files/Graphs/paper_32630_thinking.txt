To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A parameterised model for link prediction using node centrality and similarity measure based on graph embedding" by Haohui Lu and Shahadat Uddin, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the proposed model was evaluated on **five benchmark graph datasets**, which indicates that there are specific datasets to look for.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experiment)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for testing their model. In this section, they mention the following datasets:

1. **Cora Dataset**: A citation network dataset with 2,708 nodes and 5,429 edges.
2. **CiteSeer Dataset**: Another citation network dataset with 3,312 nodes and 4,660 edges.
3. **PubMed Dataset**: A larger citation network dataset with 19,717 nodes and 44,338 edges.
4. **Facebook Dataset**: A social network dataset with 4,039 nodes and 88,234 edges.
5. **ogbl-ddi Dataset**: A drug interaction network dataset with 4,267 nodes and 1,433 edges.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **Cora Dataset**:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their full citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use. This process ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their references as required.
