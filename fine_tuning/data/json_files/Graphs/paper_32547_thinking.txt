To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Synergizing Contrastive Learning and Optimal Transport for 3D Point Cloud Domain Adaptation" by Siddharth Katageri et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the datasets used in the study. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted an empirical study on **PointDA-10** and **GraspNetPC-10**, indicating that these are the primary datasets of interest.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In the **experiments section**, the authors explicitly describe the datasets used:

1. **PointDA-10**: This dataset is a combination of ten common classes from ModelNet, ShapeNet, and ScanNet. The paper provides details about the number of training and test samples from each of these datasets, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's composition.

2. **GraspNetPC-10**: This dataset consists of synthetic and real-world point clouds for ten object classes. The authors explain how this dataset was developed from GraspNet by re-projecting raw depth scans to 3D space.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are essential for proper attribution and further exploration of the datasets:

- For **PointDA-10**, the citation is:
  > Can Qin, Haoxuan You, Lichen Wang, C.-C. Jay Kuo, and Yun Fu. *Pointdan: A multi-scale 3d domain adaption network for point cloud representation*. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, volume 32, Curran Associates, Inc., 2019.

- For **GraspNetPC-10**, the citation is:
  > Yuefan Shen, Yanchao Yang, Mi Yan, He Wang, Youyi Zheng, and Leonidas J. Guibas. *Domain adaptation on point clouds via geometry-aware implicits*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 7223â€“7232, June 2022.

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture the datasets used in the research paper for future reference or analysis.
