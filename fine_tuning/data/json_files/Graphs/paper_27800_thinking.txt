To extract datasets from the research paper titled "You Never Cluster Alone" by Yuming Shen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 5), where the authors provide a table (Table 1) that lists the datasets used in their experiments. This table includes the following datasets:

1. **CIFAR-10**: A well-known dataset containing 60,000 images across 10 classes, with an input size of 32x32 pixels.
2. **CIFAR-100**: Similar to CIFAR-10 but with 100 classes, also containing 60,000 images and an input size of 32x32 pixels.
3. **STL-10**: This dataset contains 13,000 images, with an input size of 96x96 pixels, and is designed for unsupervised learning.
4. **ImageNet-10**: A subset of the original ImageNet dataset, containing 10 classes and 13,000 images, with an input size of 96x96 pixels.
5. **ImageNet-Dog**: Another subset of ImageNet, specifically focused on dog breeds, containing 19,500 images with an input size of 96x96 pixels.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **CIFAR-10** and **CIFAR-100**:
  > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. Technical Report, University of Toronto, 2009.

- For **STL-10**:
  > Adam Coates, Andrew Ng, and Honglak Lee. *An analysis of single-layer networks in unsupervised feature learning*. In AISTATS, 2011.

- For **ImageNet**:
  > Olga Russakovsky, Jia Deng, Hao Su, Jonathan Krause, Sanjeev Satheesh, Sean Ma, Zhiheng Huang, Andrej Karpathy, Aditya Khosla, Michael Bernstein, et al. *Imagenet large scale visual recognition challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 115(3):211â€“252, 2015.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
