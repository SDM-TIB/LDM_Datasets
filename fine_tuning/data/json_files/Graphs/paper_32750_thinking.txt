To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Comparative Study of Population-Graph Construction Methods and Graph Neural Networks for Brain Age Regression" by Kyriaki-Margarita Bintsi et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors leverage the **UK Biobank dataset**, which is a significant clue that a dataset is being utilized.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly describe the dataset used for their experiments. They mention that the UK Biobank (UKBB) offers a variety of imaging and non-imaging phenotypes, which is crucial for their study on brain age estimation. They also provide details about the subjects included in the dataset, such as the age range and the number of subjects.

In this section, they specify that they selected 68 neuroimaging phenotypes and 20 non-imaging phenotypes relevant to brain age, and that the dataset consists of approximately 6500 subjects aged 47 to 81 years. This information is essential for understanding the dataset's context and application.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the UK Biobank dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Alfaro-Almagro, F., Jenkinson, M., Bangerter, N.K., Andersson, J.L., Griffanti, L., Douaud, G., Sotiropoulos, S.N., Jbabdi, S., Hernandez-Fernandez, M., Vallee, E., Vidaurre, D., Webster, M., McCarthy, P., Rorden, C., Daducci, A., Alexander, D.C., Zhang, H., Dragonu, I., Matthews, P.M., Miller, K.L., Smith, S.M. "Image processing and Quality Control for the first 10,000 brain imaging datasets from UK Biobank." *NeuroImage* 166, 400â€“424 (2018).

Having gathered all the necessary information, I will summarize the dataset details:

1. **UK Biobank Dataset**: This dataset includes a wide range of imaging and non-imaging phenotypes, specifically designed for brain age estimation tasks. It consists of approximately 6500 subjects aged 47 to 81 years, with a focus on neuroimaging features derived from structural MRI and diffusion-weighted MRI.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format for further processing or review.
