To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Contrastive Learning for Low-Light Raw Denoising" by Taoyong Cui and Yuhan Dong, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on a "real low-light dataset" and "videos under starlight," which indicates that datasets are involved. I will look for specific names or descriptions of these datasets.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section 4) closely, particularly **subsections 4.1, 4.2, and 4.3**, where the authors discuss their experimental setup and the datasets used. In these subsections, the authors mention using various datasets, including:

1. **Starlight Dataset**: This dataset is referenced as being used to evaluate the performance of their proposed method. The authors claim to achieve state-of-the-art performance on this dataset.

2. **MOT Dataset**: The authors mention using clips from the MOT dataset, which is known for tracking moving objects in videos.

3. **Synthetic Noisy Clips**: The authors also refer to using synthetic noisy clips generated from clean images for training purposes.

I will now check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for the datasets used in the experiments.

- For the **Starlight Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Kristina Monakhova, Stephan R. Richter, Laura Waller, and Vladlen Koltun. "Dancing under the stars: Video denoising in starlight." In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), June 2022, pp. 16241–16251.

- For the **MOT Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Alex Bewley, Zongyuan Ge, Lionel Ott, Fabio Ramos, and Ben Upcroft. "Simple online and realtime tracking." In Proceedings of the 2016 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP), pp. 3464–3468, 2016.

- The **synthetic noisy clips** do not have a specific citation since they are generated from clean images, but I will note that they are part of the experimental setup.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
