To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MuCoT: Multilingual Contrastive Training for Question-Answering in Low-resource Languages" by Gokul Karthik Kumar et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on the **Google ChAII dataset**, which is a strong indication that this dataset is crucial to their work.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors mention the **ChAII dataset** specifically for fine-tuning and evaluation of their model. They also reference the **Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD)** as a large-scale dataset used for pre-training the QA head of their model. This suggests that both datasets are significant for their experiments.

In the **experimental results section**, the authors provide detailed information about the datasets used. They confirm that the **ChAII dataset** consists of 1,114 records of context, question, answer, and corresponding start positions in the context for Tamil and Hindi languages. They also mention that the **SQuAD dataset** contains 100,000 records of question-answer pairs along with context, which is used for pre-training.

Now, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **ChAII dataset**, the citation is:
   > Google. 2021. ChAII - Hindi and Tamil question answering. https://www.kaggle.com/c/chaii-hindi-and-tamil-question-answering [Accessed: 01-Oct-2021].

2. For the **SQuAD dataset**, the citation is:
   > Pranav Rajpurkar, Jian Zhang, Konstantin Lopyrev, and Percy Liang. 2016. SQuAD: 100,000+ questions for machine comprehension of text. In Proceedings of the 2016 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 2383â€“2392.

Having identified the datasets and their citations, I will now compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
