To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Emotion-Anchored Contrastive Learning Framework for Emotion Recognition in Conversation" by Fangxu Yu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be discussed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly **section 4.2 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly introduce the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention three datasets:

1. **IEMOCAP**: This dataset consists of 151 videos of dialogues between two speakers, containing a total of 7,433 utterances. Each utterance is annotated with one of six emotion labels: excited, frustrated, sad, neutral, angry, and happy.

2. **MELD**: This dataset is derived from the TV show "Friends" and includes approximately 13,000 utterances from 1,433 dialogues. Each utterance is labeled with one of seven emotion categories: surprise, neutral, anger, sadness, disgust, joy, and fear.

3. **EmoryNLP**: This dataset contains 97 episodes and 12,606 utterances from the TV show "Friends." It features emotional tags such as joyful, sad, powerful, mad, neutral, scared, and peaceful.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:

- For **IEMOCAP**, the citation is:
  > Carlos Busso, Murtaza Bulut, Chi-Chun Lee, Abe Kazemzadeh, Emily Mower, Samuel Kim, Jeannette N Chang, Sungbok Lee, and Shrikanth S Narayanan. *IEMOCAP: Interactive Emotional Dyadic Motion Capture Database*. Language Resources and Evaluation, 42:335â€“359, 2008.

- For **MELD**, the citation is:
  > Soujanya Poria, Devamanyu Hazarika, Navonil Majumder, Gautam Naik, Erik Cambria, and Rada Mihalcea. *MELD: A Multimodal Multi-Party Dataset for Emotion Recognition in Conversations*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1810.02508, 2018.

- For **EmoryNLP**, the citation is:
  > Zhaohong Jia, Yunwei Shi, Weifeng Liu, Zhenhua Huang, and Xiao Sun. *Emotion Detection on TV Show Transcripts with Sequence-Based Convolutional Neural Networks*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1708.04299, 2017.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will prepare to format this information according to the required structure for further processing or review.
