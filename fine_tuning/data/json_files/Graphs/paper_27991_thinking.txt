To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Group-Node Attention for Community Evolution Prediction" by Matt Revelle et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of datasets for predicting community evolution events, which indicates that datasets are likely discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section**. In this paper, the relevant information is found in **section IV (Experiments)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. They mention two specific datasets:

1. **Facebook Wall Posts Dataset**: This dataset consists of timestamped, directed interactions from Facebook, where users post on each other's walls. The authors note that this dataset is available from KONECT, which is a clear indication of its source.

2. **Scratch Project Comments Dataset**: This dataset is derived from a general Scratch dataset available from the Harvard Dataverse. It includes comments made by users on each other's projects within the Scratch platform.

I will now gather the full citations for these datasets from the **References section** of the paper:

- For the **Facebook Wall Posts Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Viswanath, B., et al. "On the evolution of user interaction in Facebook." In Proceedings of the 2nd ACM workshop on Online social networks, 2009, pp. 37–42.

- For the **Scratch Project Comments Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Resnick, M., et al. "Scratch: Programming for all." Communications of the ACM, vol. 52, no. 11, pp. 60–67, 2009.

After confirming the details and citations, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format for further use. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their sources as presented in the paper.
