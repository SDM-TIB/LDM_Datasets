To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Enhancing Micro Gesture Recognition for Emotion Understanding via Context-aware Visual-Text Contrastive Learning" by Deng Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors achieved state-of-the-art performance on two public datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental results section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this case, they mention two datasets: 

1. **iMiGUE Dataset**: This dataset is described as containing 18,499 wild-collected micro gesture samples and 359 videos for emotion understanding. The authors note that the start and end times of clips in each video are predefined for video-level emotional understanding.

2. **SMG Dataset**: This dataset is identified as a new benchmark for micro gesture recognition, collected from 40 subjects narrating both fake and real stories, consisting of 3,692 lab-collected micro gesture samples.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper. The citations I find are:

- For the **iMiGUE Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Liu, X., Shi, H., Chen, H., Yu, Z., Li, X., & Zhao, G. (2021). iMiGUE: An identity-free video dataset for micro-gesture understanding and emotion analysis. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pp. 10,631–10,642.

- For the **SMG Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Chen, H., Shi, H., Liu, X., Li, X., & Zhao, G. (2023). SMG: A micro-gesture dataset towards spontaneous body gestures for emotional stress state analysis. International Journal of Computer Vision, 131(6), 1346–1366.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. This includes ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation, which is crucial for proper attribution in any subsequent work.
