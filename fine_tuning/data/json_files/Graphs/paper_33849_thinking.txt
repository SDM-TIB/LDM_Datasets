To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Analyzing Regional Organization of the Human Hippocampus in 3D-PLI Using Contrastive Learning and Geometric Unfolding" by Alexander Oberstrass et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's goals and methods, which may hint at the types of data used.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to see if the authors reference any specific datasets or prior works that utilized datasets relevant to their research. This section often contains background information that can lead to identifying datasets.

In the **methods section**, I will look for detailed descriptions of the data collection process, including any datasets used for analysis. The authors may describe the specific datasets they utilized, including their characteristics and how they were processed.

I will also examine the **experiments section** to confirm the datasets used in the study. This section typically outlines the experimental setup and may explicitly mention the datasets employed for validation or testing.

After identifying potential datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets.

For this paper, I anticipate that the authors may have used a specific dataset related to 3D polarized light imaging (3D-PLI) of the human hippocampus. I will look for any references to datasets that contain 3D-PLI data or related imaging data.

Once I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile the information into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and full citation for each dataset.

In summary, my steps will be:
1. Read the abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections for dataset mentions.
2. Identify specific datasets and their characteristics.
3. Check the references for full citations of the datasets.
4. Compile the dataset information into a structured format for clarity and completeness.
