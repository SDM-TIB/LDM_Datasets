To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Putting RDF2vec in Order" by Jan Portisch and Heiko Paulheim, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, experiments, and related work sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the RDF2vec method and its performance on various tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved, but I need to find specific names.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the RDF2vec approach and its relation to knowledge graphs, but they do not explicitly mention datasets here. I will continue to the **experiments section**, where the authors detail their evaluation process.

In **section 3 (Experiments and Preliminary Results)**, the authors state that they evaluate their approach on "six tasks using 20 datasets altogether." This indicates that multiple datasets are used, but I need to find their specific names and details.

As I read further in the experiments section, the authors list specific datasets used for evaluation, including:

1. **AAUP**
2. **Cities**
3. **Forbes**
4. **Metacritic Albums**
5. **Metacritic Movies**
6. **Cities/Countries (2k)**
7. **Cities/Countries**
8. **Cities/Albums/Movies/AAUP/Forbes**
9. **Teams**
10. **Capital-Countries**
11. **Capital-Countries (all)**
12. **Currency-Country**
13. **City-State**

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. However, the paper does not provide specific citations for each dataset directly. Instead, I will look for any references that might describe these datasets or their origins.

Upon reviewing the references, I find that some datasets may be derived from previous works cited in the paper. For example, the **AAUP** dataset might refer to a dataset used in the context of academic publishing, while **Cities** and **Countries** datasets could be sourced from geographic databases or previous research.

Since the paper does not provide explicit citations for each dataset, I will note that the datasets are likely based on common knowledge or publicly available datasets in the field of knowledge graph embeddings and machine learning.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the names of the datasets and any relevant context or descriptions based on the information provided in the paper. If specific citations are not available, I will indicate that the datasets are commonly used in the field without specific references.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring that each dataset is clearly identified and described, even if full citations are not available.
