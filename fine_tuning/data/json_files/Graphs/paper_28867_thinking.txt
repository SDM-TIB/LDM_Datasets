To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Dual Space Graph Contrastive Learning" by Haoran Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may highlight key datasets used for experiments. In this case, the authors mention conducting experiments on various datasets, which indicates that I should look for specific names in the subsequent sections.

Next, I will examine **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention three datasets: **MUTAG**, **REDDIT-BINARY**, and **COLLAB**. I will take note of the context in which these datasets are mentioned, including their purpose and any relevant statistics provided.

In **Table 1**, the authors provide detailed statistics for each dataset, including the number of graphs, number of classes, average number of nodes, and average number of edges. This information is crucial for understanding the datasets' characteristics.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The authors reference the datasets as follows:

1. **MUTAG Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Nils M. Kriege and Petra Mutzel. *Subgraph Matching Kernels for Attributed Graphs*. In Proceedings of the 29th International Conference on Machine Learning, ICML 2012, Edinburgh, Scotland, UK, June 26 - July 1, 2012. icml.cc / Omnipress. http://icml.cc/2012/papers/542.pdf

2. **REDDIT-BINARY Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Pinar Yanardag and S. V. N. Vishwanathan. *Deep Graph Kernels*. In Proceedings of the 21th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, Sydney, NSW, Australia, August 10-13, 2015. ACM, 1365–1374. https://doi.org/10.1145/2783258.2783417

3. **COLLAB Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Pinar Yanardag and S. V. N. Vishwanathan. *Deep Graph Kernels*. In Proceedings of the 21th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, Sydney, NSW, Australia, August 10-13, 2015. ACM, 1365–1374. https://doi.org/10.1145/2783258.2783417

Although the COLLAB dataset shares the same citation as the REDDIT-BINARY dataset, it is important to note that they are distinct datasets used in the experiments.

Finally, I will compile the extracted dataset information, including their descriptions and full citations, ensuring that I adhere to the required format for clarity and completeness. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any critical details regarding the datasets used in the research paper.
