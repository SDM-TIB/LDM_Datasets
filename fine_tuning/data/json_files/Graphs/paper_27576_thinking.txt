To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Visual Comfort Aware-Reinforcement Learning for Depth Adjustment of Stereoscopic 3D Images" by Hak Gu Kim et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on "three different S3D databases," which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically looking for any explicit mentions of datasets used for training and testing. In this section, the authors state that they used the **IEEE-SA stereo image database** for training their model, which consists of 800 stereoscopic image pairs with corresponding subjective comfort scores. This is a clear dataset that I need to document.

Additionally, the authors mention two other databases used for testing: the **NBU 3D-VCA database** and the **IVY Lab S3D image database**. The NBU 3D-VCA database contains 200 stereoscopic images with associated mean opinion scores for visual comfort, while the IVY Lab S3D image database consists of 120 stereoscopic images captured by a 3D digital camera, also with corresponding mean opinion scores.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **IEEE-SA stereo image database**, the citation is:
   > Park, J., Oh, H., Lee, S., & Bovik, A. C. (2014). 3D visual discomfort predictor: Analysis of disparity and neural activity statistics. *IEEE Transactions on Image Processing*, 24(3), 1101-1114.

2. For the **NBU 3D-VCA database**, the citation is:
   > Jiang, Q., Shao, F., Jiang, G., Yu, M., & Peng, Z. (2015). Three-dimensional visual comfort assessment via preference learning. *Journal of Electronic Imaging*, 24(4), 043002.

3. For the **IVY Lab S3D image database**, the citation is:
   > Jung, Y. J., Sohn, H., Lee, S.-I., & Ro, Y. M. (2013). Predicting visual discomfort of stereoscopic images using human attention model. *IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology*, 23(12), 2077-2082.

With these details in hand, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
