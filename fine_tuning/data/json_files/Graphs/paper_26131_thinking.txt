To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Cross-Modal Interaction Networks for Query-Based Moment Retrieval in Videos" by Zhu Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract and introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments on two public datasets for query-based moment retrieval, which indicates that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets**. In this paper, the relevant section is **section 4.1 (Datasets)**. Here, the authors explicitly mention two datasets used for their experiments:

1. **ActivityCaption Dataset**: This dataset is described as containing 20,000 untrimmed videos, each with multiple natural language descriptions and temporal annotations. The authors note that the dataset is diverse and open, and they provide a summary of its characteristics.

2. **TACoS Dataset**: This dataset consists of 127 videos focused on cooking scenes, with a large number of temporal textual annotations. The authors highlight that while the videos are longer, the target moments are shorter compared to the ActivityCaption dataset.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper:

- For the **ActivityCaption Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Ranjay Krishna, Kenji Hata, Frederic Ren, Li Fei-Fei, and Juan Carlos Niebles. *Dense-Captioning Events in Videos*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 706–715, 2017.

- For the **TACoS Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Michaela Regneri, Marcus Rohrbach, Dominikus Wetzel, Stefan Thater, Bernt Schiele, and Manfred Pinkal. *Grounding Action Descriptions in Videos*. Transactions of the Association of Computational Linguistics, 1 (2013), 25–36.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will prepare to format this information according to the required structure for downstream processing or review. This includes ensuring that each dataset is clearly described with its citation included.
