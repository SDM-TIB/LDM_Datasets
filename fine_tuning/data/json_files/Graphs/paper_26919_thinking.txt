To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Tracklets Predicting Based Adaptive Graph Tracking" by Chaobing Shan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors achieved state-of-the-art performance on the **MOT16** and **MOT17** challenges, indicating that these datasets are likely used in their experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically **section 4.1 (Datasets and Metrics)**, where the authors provide a brief overview of the datasets used. Here, they explicitly mention:

1. **MOT16 Dataset**: This dataset includes 7 training videos and 7 testing videos, with a total of 517 identities and 110,407 bounding boxes across 5,316 frames.

2. **MOT17 Dataset**: Similar to MOT16, this dataset also consists of 7 training and 7 testing videos, but it has 1,638 identities and 336,891 bounding boxes across 16,948 frames.

The authors also provide a table summarizing the datasets, which confirms the details mentioned above.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **MOT16 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Milan, A., Leal-Taixe, L., Reid, I., Roth, S., & Schindler, K. (2016). *MOT16: A Benchmark for Multi-Object Tracking*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1603.00831.

- For **MOT17 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Ristani, E., Solera, F., Zou, R., Cucchiara, R., & Tomasi, C. (2016). *Performance Measures and a Data Set for Multi-Object, Multi-Camera Tracking*. In ECCV workshop on Benchmarking multi-object Tracking, 2016.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
