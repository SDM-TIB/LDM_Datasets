To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Out-of-distribution Detection with Boundary Aware Learning" by Sen Pei et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, but I will need to look deeper into the paper for specific dataset names.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention several datasets:

1. **MNIST**: A database of handwritten digits with a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples.
2. **Fashion-MNIST**: A dataset containing grayscale images of fashion products, also with a training set of 60,000 images and a test set of 10,000 images.
3. **Omniglot**: A dataset that includes 1,623 different handwritten characters from 50 different alphabets, treated as OOD data in this work.
4. **CIFAR-10**: A dataset with 60,000 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class.
5. **CIFAR-100**: Similar to CIFAR-10 but contains 60,000 images in 100 classes, with 600 images per class.
6. **TinyImageNet**: A dataset containing 120,000 color images in 200 classes, with 600 images per class.
7. **SVHN**: A dataset of color images of street view house numbers.
8. **LSUN**: A large-scale scene understanding dataset.

I will then check the **References section** for full citations of these datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations into a structured format for further processing or review.
