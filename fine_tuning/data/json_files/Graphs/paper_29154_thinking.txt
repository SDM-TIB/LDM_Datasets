To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Contrastive Learning for Automotive mmWave Radar Detection Points Based Instance Segmentation" by Weiyi Xiong et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract and introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of a contrastive learning approach for radar detection points-based instance segmentation, but it does not specify any datasets yet.

Next, I will examine **section IV (Experiments)**, as this section typically contains detailed information about the datasets used in the experiments. In this section, the authors mention that they chose the **RadarScenes** dataset for their experiments. I will look for a detailed description of this dataset, including its characteristics and the number of sequences and frames.

The paper states that the RadarScenes dataset contains **158 sequences of data with 1,556,684 frames of radar detection point clouds**. It also mentions that the dataset includes various features such as coordinates, velocity, and radar cross-section (RCS) for the points. The authors specify that only dynamic points are used, focusing on road users, and that the 11 categories of non-static objects are merged into 5 categories.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the RadarScenes dataset. The citation provided in the references is:

> O. Schumann, M. Hahn, N. Scheiner, F. Weishaupt, J. F. Tilly, J. Dickmann, and C. Wöhler. "Radarscenes: A real-world radar point cloud data set for automotive applications." In Proc. Int. Conf. Inf. Fusion, 2021, pp. 1–8.

Since this is the only dataset mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information into a structured format.

Finally, I will ensure that I have accurately captured the dataset's name, description, and citation, ready for any further processing or review.
