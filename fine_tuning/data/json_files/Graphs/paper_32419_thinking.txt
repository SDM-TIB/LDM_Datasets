To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning a Graph Neural Network with Cross Modality Interaction for Image Fusion" by Jiawei Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. In the abstract, the authors mention conducting extensive experiments on different datasets, specifically naming **TNO**, **M3FD**, and **MFNet**. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for the research and should be documented.

Next, I will look into **section 4.2 (Dataset Selection and Comparison)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention:

1. **TNO Dataset**: The authors state that this dataset contains infrared and visible image pairs, and they used 15 pairs for training and 10 pairs for testing.

2. **M3FD Dataset**: This dataset is also mentioned as containing infrared and visible image pairs, with 150 pairs used for training and 150 pairs for testing.

3. **MFNet Dataset**: The authors indicate that this dataset has 1083 pairs for training and 361 pairs for testing, and it includes labeled images for detection and segmentation tasks.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** for the full citations of these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For the **TNO Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Alexander Toet. *The TNO multiband image data collection*. Data in brief 15 (2017), 249–251.

- For the **M3FD Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Qishen Ha, Kohei Watanabe, Takumi Karasawa, Yoshitaka Ushiku, and Tatsuya Harada. *MFNet: Towards real-time semantic segmentation for autonomous vehicles with multi-spectral scenes*. In 2017 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS), pages 5108–5115, 2017.

- For the **MFNet Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Linfeng Tang, Xinyu Xiang, Hao Zhang, Meiqi Gong, and Jiayi Ma. *DIV-Fusion: Darkness-free infrared and visible image fusion*. Information Fusion 91 (2023), 477–493.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations.
