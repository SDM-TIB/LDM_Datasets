To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Graph Adversarial Training: Dynamically Regularizing Based on Graph Structure" by Fuli Feng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on **two citation graphs (Citeseer and Cora) and a knowledge graph (NELL)**, indicating that these are the datasets used in their research.

Next, I will look for specific details about these datasets in the **experiments section**. The authors provide a summary of the datasets used, including their characteristics. In **section 5.1.1 (Datasets)**, they describe:

1. **Citeseer**: A citation network dataset with 3,312 nodes, 4,732 edges, 6 classes, and 3,703 features.
2. **Cora**: Another citation network dataset with 2,708 nodes, 5,429 edges, 7 classes, and 1,433 features.
3. **NELL**: A knowledge graph with 65,755 nodes, 266,144 edges, 210 classes, and 5,414 features.

The authors also mention the label rates for these datasets, which are important for understanding the context of the experiments.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **Citeseer**, the citation is:
  > Sen, P., Namata, G., Bilgic, M., Getoor, L., Galligher, B., & Eliassi-Rad, T. (2008). *Collective classification in network data*. AI Magazine, 29(3), 93.

- For **Cora**, the citation is:
  > McCallum, A., & Yang, Y. (2003). *Efficiently identifying authoritative documents in a hyperlinked environment*. In Proceedings of the 26th Annual International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval (pp. 1-7).

- For **NELL**, the citation is:
  > Carlson, A., Betteridge, J., Kisiel, J., & Settles, B. (2010). *Toward an architecture for never-ending language learning*. In Proceedings of the 2010 National Conference on Artificial Intelligence (pp. 1306-1313).

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly presents each dataset along with its citation. This will ensure that the datasets are accurately represented and can be referenced appropriately in future work.
