To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Framework for an Intelligent Affect Aware Smart Home Environment for Elderly People" by Nirmalya Thakur and Chia Y. Han, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the proposed framework has been tested on three datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology or results sections**. In the results section, the authors discuss the implementation of their framework and mention that it was tested on three datasets. I will pay close attention to any specific names or descriptions of these datasets.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors explicitly mention three datasets:

1. **The dataset developed by Sztyler et al.**: This dataset is a subset created during research on activity recognition at the University of Mannheim. It consists of tracking Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) performed by seven individuals in an IoT-based smart home environment over 14 days.

2. **The dataset from Goodfellow et al.**: This dataset contains facial images of users captured while they performed different activities, providing information about muscle movements and emotional states using the Facial Action Coding System (FACS).

3. **The UK Domestic Appliance Level Electricity (DALE) dataset**: This dataset consists of details of appliance usage patterns recorded over a time resolution of six seconds in five smart homes in Southern England from 2012 to 2015.

Next, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for each dataset:

- For the dataset from Goodfellow et al.:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their full citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This systematic approach ensures that I have accurately captured the relevant datasets and their citations from the research paper.
