To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Time to Augment Self-Supervised Visual Representation Learning" by Arthur Aubret et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study and may mention key datasets used for validation or experimentation.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss their approach and reference two specific datasets: **ToyBox** and **CORe50**. This indicates that these datasets are important for their experiments, and I will need to gather more details about them.

Next, I will look into the **methods section**, particularly the subsections where the authors describe their experimental setup. Here, they mention the **Toys4k dataset**, which is used in conjunction with their simulation environments. They also provide details about the **Virtual Home Environment (VHE)** and the **3D Shape Environment (3DShapeE)**, which are not datasets per se but rather environments where the datasets are utilized.

In the **results section**, the authors validate their findings using the **ToyBox** and **CORe50** datasets, confirming their significance in the experiments.

Now, I will compile the details of each dataset, including their descriptions and full citations from the references section:

1. **Toys4k Dataset**: This dataset consists of 4,179 diverse 3D toy objects distributed across 105 categories. It is designed to match the objects typically encountered by infants.
   - Citation: Stojanov, S., Thai, A., & Rehg, J. M. (2021). *Using shape to categorize: Low-shot learning with an explicit shape bias*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 1798–1808.

2. **ToyBox Dataset**: This dataset contains first-person videos of an observer manipulating 360 objects across 12 categories. Each clip features various transformations applied to the objects.
   - Citation: Wang, X., Ma, T., Ainooson, J., Cha, S., Wang, X., Molla, A., & Kunda, M. (2018). *The ToyBox dataset of egocentric visual object transformations*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1806.06034.

3. **CORe50 Dataset**: This dataset includes 167,866 images of 50 different objects belonging to 10 distinct categories, filmed in various sessions to capture different environments.
   - Citation: Lomonaco, V., & Maltoni, D. (2017). *CORe50: A new dataset and benchmark for continuous object recognition*. In Conference on Robot Learning, pages 17–26.

4. **Virtual Home Environment (VHE)**: While not a dataset in the traditional sense, it is a simulation environment that utilizes the Toys4k dataset for training and testing.
   - Citation: Aubret, A., Teulière, C., & Triesch, J. (2022). *Toddler-inspired embodied vision for learning object representations*. In IEEE 21st International Conference on Development and Learning (ICDL).

5. **3D Shape Environment (3DShapeE)**: Similar to VHE, this is another simulation environment that uses the Toys4k dataset.
   - Citation: Aubret, A., Teulière, C., & Triesch, J. (2022). *Toddler-inspired embodied vision for learning object representations*. In IEEE 21st International Conference on Development and Learning (ICDL).

After gathering this information, I will ensure that each dataset is clearly documented with its description and citation, ready for further processing or review.
