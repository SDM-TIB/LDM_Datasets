To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Incubation: Training Large Models by Divide-and-Conquering" by Zanlin Ni et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the proposed method, Deep Incubation, has been empirically validated on several benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, they mention using **ImageNet-1K**, **COCO**, and **ADE20K** for their experiments. I will take note of these datasets and look for specific details about each one.

1. **ImageNet-1K**: This dataset is widely known for image classification tasks and is referenced multiple times throughout the paper. I will confirm its details in the references section.

2. **COCO**: The authors mention using the COCO dataset for object detection and instance segmentation tasks. I will look for its specific citation in the references.

3. **ADE20K**: This dataset is mentioned for semantic segmentation tasks. I will also check the references for its citation.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **ImageNet-1K**, the citation is:
  > Olga Russakovsky, Jia Deng, Hao Su, Jonathan Krause, Sanjeev Satheesh, Sean Ma, Zhiheng Huang, Andrej Karpathy, Aditya Khosla, Michael Bernstein, et al. *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision (IJCV), 2015.

- For **COCO**, the citation is:
  > Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, Serge Belongie, James Hays, Pietro Perona, Deva Ramanan, Piotr DollÃ¡r, and C Lawrence Zitnick. *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), 2014.

- For **ADE20K**, the citation is:
  > Bolei Zhou, Hang Zhao, Xavier Puig, Tete Xiao, Sanja Fidler, Adela Barriuso, and Antonio Torralba. *Semantic Understanding of Scenes through the ADE20K Dataset*. International Journal of Computer Vision (IJCV), 2019.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **ImageNet-1K**: A large-scale dataset for image classification containing over 1 million images across 1,000 categories.
2. **COCO**: A dataset designed for object detection, segmentation, and captioning, containing over 330,000 images with 80 object categories.
3. **ADE20K**: A dataset for semantic segmentation that includes over 20,000 images with pixel-level annotations for various object categories.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all details are accurately represented for future reference or processing.
