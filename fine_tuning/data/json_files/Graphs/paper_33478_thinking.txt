To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "A Comprehensive Framework for Occluded Human Pose Estimation" by Linhao Xu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the challenges in human pose estimation due to occlusion, but I need to look for specific dataset names.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they mention three datasets:

1. **MSCOCO-RE**: The paper describes the train2017 dataset, which contains 57,000 images with over 150,000 person instances. The val2017 set and test-dev set contain 5,000 images and 20,000 images, respectively. This dataset is a re-labeling of the val2017 set, adding annotations for occluded joints.

2. **CrowdPose**: This dataset consists of 20,000 images and 80,000 persons labeled with 14 keypoints. The authors specify that they used the trainval set for training and the test set for evaluation.

3. **OCHuman**: The authors describe this dataset as containing 4,731 images and 8,110 person instances, with 2,500 images in the validation set and 2,231 images in the test set.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **CrowdPose**, the citation is:
  > Jiefeng Li, Can Wang, and Hao Zhu. "CrowdPose: Efficient crowded scenes pose estimation and a new benchmark." In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2019, pp. 10863–10872.

- For **OCHuman**, the citation is:
  > Song-Hai Zhang, Ruilong Li, and Xin Dong. "Pose2seg: Detection free human instance segmentation." In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2019, pp. 889–898.

- For **MSCOCO-RE**, while the paper does not provide a specific citation for the re-labeling, it is based on the original MSCOCO dataset, which is widely cited:
  > Tsung-Yi Lin, Piotr Dollar, Ross Girshick, and Kaiming He. "Feature pyramid networks for object detection." In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2017, pp. 2117–2125.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing.
