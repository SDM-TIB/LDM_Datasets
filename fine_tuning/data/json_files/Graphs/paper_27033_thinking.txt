To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Heterogeneous Contrastive Learning: Encoding Spatial Information for Compact Visual Representations" by Xinyue Huo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the effectiveness of the proposed method in various downstream tasks, which suggests that datasets are likely involved. 

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names and descriptions. 

In the experiments section, the authors evaluate their method on several datasets, including:

1. **ImageNet-1K**: This dataset is mentioned as the one used for pre-training the model. It contains approximately 1.28 million images across 1,000 classes.

2. **MS-COCO**: This dataset is used for object detection and instance segmentation tasks. It is a well-known benchmark in the computer vision community.

3. **LVIS**: This dataset is used for instance segmentation and is noted for its long-tail distribution of object categories.

4. **PASCAL VOC**: This dataset is used for both object detection and semantic segmentation tasks.

5. **Cityscapes**: This dataset is used for instance and semantic segmentation in urban scenes.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **ImageNet**, the citation is:

- For **Cityscapes**, the citation is:

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described along with its full citation. This structured approach will help in organizing the datasets for further analysis or processing.
