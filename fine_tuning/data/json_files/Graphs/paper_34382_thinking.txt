To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Generalization Theory of Cross-Modality Distillation with Contrastive Learning" by Hangyu Lin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the datasets used in the research. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments across various modalities, which suggests that multiple datasets may be involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention three specific tasks: image-sketch, video-audio, and image-depth map. Each task is likely to have associated datasets.

1. **Image-Sketch Task**: The authors state that they used the **ImageNet** dataset for contrastive learning and the **Sketchy** dataset for paired data. The downstream recognition tasks were performed on both the **Sketchy** and **TUBerlin** datasets.

2. **Video-Audio Task**: For this task, the authors used **ImageNet** again for contrastive learning on video frames and a subset of **VGGSound** for the audio modality.

3. **Image-Depth Map Task**: The authors utilized **ImageNet** for contrastive learning and the **NYU-Depth V2** dataset for the depth map.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

- For **ImageNet**, the citation is:

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations into a structured format for further processing or review.
