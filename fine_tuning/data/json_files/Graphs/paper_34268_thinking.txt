To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multimodal 3D Object Detection on Unseen Domains" by Deepti Hegde et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the challenges of LiDAR datasets and mentions the use of multimodal data, which suggests that datasets are involved, but does not specify any names.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section. Here, the authors refer to several large-scale multimodal datasets containing registered LiDAR point clouds and RGB images. They cite references [7, 9, 13, 19, 37], which likely correspond to specific datasets. I will need to check these references for the exact dataset names.

Moving on to **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. They mention four datasets:
1. **Lyft Dataset**: A popular dataset for autonomous driving.
2. **KITTI Dataset**: A well-known dataset for various computer vision tasks, including 3D object detection.
3. **Waymo Open Dataset**: A large-scale dataset for autonomous driving research.
4. **nuScenes Dataset**: Another multimodal dataset for autonomous driving.

In this section, the authors also provide some context about the datasets, such as their characteristics and the conditions under which they were captured.

Next, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned. The references will provide the necessary details to properly cite each dataset.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:
- **Lyft Dataset**:

- **nuScenes Dataset**:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is properly documented for future reference or analysis.
