To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Batch Virtual Adversarial Training for Graph Convolutional Networks" by Zhijie Deng, Yinpeng Dong, and Jun Zhu, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. In the abstract, the authors state that they conducted extensive experiments on **three citation network datasets: Cora, Citeseer, and Pubmed**, as well as a knowledge graph dataset called **Nell**. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for the research.

Next, I will look into **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors provide more details about the datasets used. They mention that they evaluate their method on the same datasets and splits as previous works, specifically citing **Cora, Citeseer, Pubmed**, and **Nell**. This confirms that these datasets are indeed the ones utilized in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The paper cites the following works that describe these datasets:

1. **Cora Dataset**: 
   > Sen, P., Namata, G., Bilgic, M., Getoor, L., Galligher, B., & Eliassi-Rad, T. (2008). Collective classification in network data. *AI Magazine*, 29(3), 93.

2. **Citeseer Dataset**: 
   > Sen, P., Namata, G., Bilgic, M., Getoor, L., Galligher, B., & Eliassi-Rad, T. (2008). Collective classification in network data. *AI Magazine*, 29(3), 93.

3. **Pubmed Dataset**: 
   > Sen, P., Namata, G., Bilgic, M., Getoor, L., Galligher, B., & Eliassi-Rad, T. (2008). Collective classification in network data. *AI Magazine*, 29(3), 93.

4. **Nell Dataset**: 
   > Yang, Z., Cohen, W., & Salakhudinov, R. (2016). Revisiting semi-supervised learning with graph embeddings. In *International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML)*, pp. 40-48.

Since the Cora, Citeseer, and Pubmed datasets are all referenced from the same source, I will use that citation for all three.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations, ensuring that I include all necessary details for each dataset as per the requirements. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.
