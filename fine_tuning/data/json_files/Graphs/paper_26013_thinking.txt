To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Graph Neural Networks for Modelling Traffic Participant Interaction" by Frederik Diehl et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant details, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their method on two real-world datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed present in the paper. The introduction further emphasizes the importance of traffic participant prediction and hints at the datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will navigate to **section IV (Experiments)**, specifically the subsection **A (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention:

1. **NGSIM I-80 Dataset**: This dataset contains trajectory data for vehicles in a highway merge scenario, tracked using a fixed camera system. The authors describe the data collection process and how they prepared the data for their experiments.

2. **HighD Dataset**: This dataset consists of drone recordings capturing vehicle features on the German Autobahn. The authors provide details about the data's scale and the nature of the interactions within the dataset.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **NGSIM I-80 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Federal Highway Administration (FHWA). *US Highway 80 Dataset*, FHWA-HRT-06-137, Tech. Rep., 2005.

- For the **HighD Dataset**, the citation is:
  > R. Krajewski, J. Bock, L. Kloeker, and L. Eckstein. *The HighD Dataset: A Drone Dataset of Naturalistic Vehicle Trajectories on German Highways for Validation of Highly Automated Driving Systems*. In Proceedings of the 2018 IEEE 21st International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC), 2018.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will prepare to compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their respective citations as required.
