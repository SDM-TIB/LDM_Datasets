To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fully Unsupervised Person Re-identification via Selective Contrastive Learning" by Bo Pang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method on several datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors explicitly list the datasets used for evaluation in section IV (Experiments). They mention five datasets:

1. **Market-1501**: This dataset consists of 32,668 images of 1,501 identities captured under six different cameras.
2. **DukeMTMC-ReID**: This dataset contains 1,812 identities and 36,411 images, also captured under eight cameras.
3. **MSMT17**: A more challenging dataset with 126,411 person images of 4,101 identities across 15 cameras, noted for substantial variations in scene and lighting.
4. **DukeMTMC-VideoReID**: A video-based dataset containing 2,196 tracklets of 702 identities for training and 2,636 tracklets of other identities for testing.
5. **MARS**: Another video-based dataset for person re-identification, containing 17,503 video tracklets of 1,261 identities.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:

- For **Market-1501**, the citation is:

- For **DukeMTMC-ReID**, the citation is:

- For **DukeMTMC-VideoReID**, the citation is:

- For **MARS**, the citation is:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
