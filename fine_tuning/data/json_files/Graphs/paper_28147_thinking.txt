To extract datasets from the research paper titled "LINKTELLER: Recovering Private Edges from Graph Neural Networks via Influence Analysis" by Fan Wu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. In the abstract, the authors mention evaluating their method on **eight datasets for inductive learning** and **three datasets for transductive learning**. This indicates that multiple datasets are involved, and I need to find their specific names.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section**, particularly focusing on any subsections that discuss datasets. The authors provide a detailed description of the datasets used for their experiments. They mention:

1. **Twitch Dataset**: This dataset is composed of multiple graphs representing users in different countries, with specific features related to user interactions.
2. **PPI Dataset**: This dataset is used for multi-label classification tasks related to biological protein-protein interactions.
3. **Flickr Dataset**: This dataset is described as an evolving graph for classification tasks, containing descriptions and properties of images.

I will also check the **appendices** for any additional details or datasets that may not have been mentioned in the main sections. The paper includes a section that provides statistics for the datasets, confirming the number of nodes, edges, and classes for each dataset.

Now, I will compile the full citations for each dataset from the **References section** of the paper. The citations are as follows:

- For the **Twitch Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Rozemberczki, B., Allen, C., & Sarkar, R. (2019). Multi-scale attributed node embedding.

- For the **PPI Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Hamilton, W. L., Ying, Z., & Leskovec, J. (2017). Inductive representation learning on large graphs. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS).

- For the **Flickr Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Zeng, H., Zhou, H., Srivastava, A., Kannan, R., & Prasanna, V. K. (2020). GraphSAINT: Graph sampling based inductive learning method. In International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR).

After gathering all the necessary information, I will summarize the datasets and their citations in a structured format for clarity and future reference. This will ensure that I have accurately captured all relevant datasets from the paper along with their proper citations.
