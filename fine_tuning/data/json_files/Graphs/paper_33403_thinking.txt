To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ContraNovo: A Contrastive Learning Approach to Enhance De Novo Peptide Sequencing" by Zhi Jin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their method on "two benchmark datasets," which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section**, specifically the **Datasets subsection**, where the authors typically provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, I will look for the names, descriptions, and any relevant statistics about the datasets.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention two datasets:

1. **MassIVE-KB Dataset**: This dataset contains 30 million high-resolution peptide-spectrum matches (PSMs) derived from various instruments and includes numerous post-translational modifications. It is referenced as a significant resource for contrastive learning representation.

2. **9-species Benchmark Dataset**: This dataset includes approximately 1.5 million mass spectra from nine distinct experiments, all utilizing the same instrument but analyzing peptides from different species. Each spectrum is accompanied by a peptide sequence confirmed through a database search identification.

Next, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **MassIVE-KB Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Wang, M., Wang, J., Carver, J., Pullman, B. S., Cha, S. W., & Bandeira, N. (2018). Assembling the community-scale discoverable human proteome. *Cell Systems*, 7(4), 412-421.

- For the **9-species Benchmark Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Tran, N. H., Zhang, X., Xin, L., Shan, B., & Li, M. (2017). De novo peptide sequencing by deep learning. *Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences*, 114(31), 8247-8252.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
