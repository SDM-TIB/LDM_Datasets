To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Graph Neural Networks for Double-Strand DNA Breaks Prediction" by Xu Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on datasets from normal human epidermal keratinocytes (NHEK) and chronic myeloid leukemia cell line (K562). This suggests that these datasets are crucial for the study.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any additional context or details about these datasets. The introduction discusses the significance of double-strand DNA breaks (DSBs) and mentions the use of high-throughput sequencing technologies, but it primarily reiterates the focus on the NHEK and K562 datasets.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide specific details about the datasets used. They mention that the NHEK dataset is derived from normal human epidermal keratinocytes, while the K562 dataset is from a cancer cell line. The paper also states that both datasets contain 22 autosomes and the X chromosome, excluding the Y chromosome.

The paper includes a **table (Table 1)** that summarizes statistics for both datasets, such as the average number of nodes and edges, density, and the positive/negative ratio. This information is useful for understanding the datasets' characteristics.

The authors also provide a note that the DSB datasets for NHEK and K562 are available at the NCBI under specific accession codes. This is crucial for citation purposes.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets. The paper mentions that the DSB datasets are available at the NCBI under accession code GSE78172 for NHEK and at the Sequence Read Archive under SRP099132 for K562. 

The full citations for these datasets are as follows:

1. **NHEK Dataset**:
   > NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus. *GSE78172: Gene expression profiles of normal human epidermal keratinocytes*. Available at: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE78172.

2. **K562 Dataset**:
   > Sequence Read Archive. *SRP099132: RNA-Seq of chronic myeloid leukemia cell line K562*. Available at: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/?term=SRP099132.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the study, ready for further processing or review.
