To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CORI: CJKV Benchmark with Romanization Integration - A step towards Cross-lingual Transfer Beyond Textual Scripts" by Hoang H. Nguyen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and dataset construction sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors constructed a novel benchmark dataset for CJKV languages, which suggests that there is a specific dataset to look for.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Dataset Construction)**, where the authors describe the CORI dataset in detail. They mention that CORI contains 6 sub-datasets across different Natural Language Understanding (NLU) tasks. I will extract the names and descriptions of these sub-datasets.

The paper outlines the following datasets:

1. **PAWSX**: A sentence-level task dataset for paraphrase identification.
2. **XNLI**: A sentence-level task dataset for natural language inference.
3. **UDPOS**: A token-level task dataset for part-of-speech tagging.
4. **PANX**: A token-level task dataset for named entity recognition.
5. **XQuAD**: A question answering dataset.
6. **MLQA**: Another question answering dataset.

In the **table summarizing the CORI benchmark dataset**, I will find the specific details regarding the training, validation, and test sets for each of these datasets, including the number of samples available.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The authors reference the original sources for the datasets they used, which is crucial for proper citation.

For example, the citations for the datasets are as follows:

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
