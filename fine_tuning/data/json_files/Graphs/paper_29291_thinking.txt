To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SpatioTemporal Focus for Skeleton-based Action Recognition" by Liyu Wu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results on three benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically looking for any explicit mentions of datasets. In this section, the authors list three datasets used for evaluation:

1. **NTU RGB+D 60**: This dataset contains 56,880 skeleton clips across 60 action classes, including various daily actions and interactions. It was captured in a controlled environment with multiple camera views.

2. **NTU RGB+D 120**: An extension of the NTU RGB+D 60 dataset, this dataset includes 114,480 samples across 120 action classes, with additional evaluation benchmarks.

3. **Kinetics Skeleton 400**: This dataset consists of 240,436 training and 19,796 evaluation skeleton clips across 400 classes, with joint locations estimated from the Kinetics400 action recognition dataset.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **NTU RGB+D 60**, the citation is:
  > A. Shahroudy, J. Liu, T.-T. Ng, and G. Wang. "NTU RGB+D: A Large Scale Dataset for 3D Human Activity Analysis." In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 1010–1019, 2016.

- For **NTU RGB+D 120**, the citation is:
  > J. Liu, A. Shahroudy, M. Perez, G. Wang, L.-Y. Duan, and A. C. Kot. "NTU RGB+D 120: A Large-Scale Benchmark for 3D Human Activity Understanding." IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, vol. 42, no. 10, pp. 2684–2701, 2019.

- For **Kinetics Skeleton 400**, the citation is:

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
