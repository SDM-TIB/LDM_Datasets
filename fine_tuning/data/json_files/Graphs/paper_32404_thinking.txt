To extract datasets from the research paper titled "COMICS: End-to-end Bi-grained Contrastive Learning for Multi-face Forgery Detection" by Cong Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that extensive experiments were conducted on the **OpenForensics** and **FFIW** datasets, indicating that these are the primary datasets used in the research.

Next, I will look for specific details about these datasets in the **experiments section**. The authors provide a detailed description of the **OpenForensics dataset**, stating that it contains 44,122 images with annotations for real and fake faces, and is suitable for multi-face forgery detection and segmentation. The validation and test sets are also described, with specific numbers of images and face counts.

For the **FFIW dataset**, the authors mention that it is a DeepFake video dataset containing 16,000 videos, with ground truth available only for fake faces. They also explain how they processed the videos to extract frames for training and evaluation.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

1. **OpenForensics Dataset**:
   - Citation:
     > T.-N. Le, H. H. Nguyen, J. Yamagishi, and I. Echizen. "OpenForensics: Large-scale challenging dataset for multi-face forgery detection and segmentation in-the-wild." In Proceedings of the IEEE Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Conference (CVPR), 2021, pp. 10 117–10 127.

2. **FFIW Dataset**:
   - Citation:
     > Yuezun Li, X. Yang, P. Sun, H. Qi, and S. Lyu. "Celeb-DF: A large-scale challenging dataset for deepfake forensics." In Proceedings of the IEEE Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Conference (CVPR), 2020, pp. 3207–3216.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

- **OpenForensics Dataset**: A large-scale dataset designed for multi-face forgery detection and segmentation, containing 44,122 images with annotations for real and fake faces.
- **FFIW Dataset**: A DeepFake video dataset with 16,000 videos, focusing on detecting fake faces, with ground truth available only for the fake faces.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference and use in future work.
