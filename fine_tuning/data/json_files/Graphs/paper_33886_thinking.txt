To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Subhomogeneous Deep Equilibrium Models" by Pietro Sittoni and Francesco Tudisco, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for evaluation. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets in relation to the research objectives.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, characteristics, and any relevant details about how they were used in the experiments.

In this paper, I will pay particular attention to any tables or figures that summarize the datasets or their performance metrics, as these often contain concise information about the datasets.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily.

For example, if the authors mention using the **MNIST dataset**, I will look for its citation in the references. The citation for MNIST is:
> Yann LeCun and Corinna Cortes. *MNIST handwritten digit database*. 2010. URL: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/.

If they mention other datasets like **CIFAR-10** or **Cora**, I will also find their respective citations:
- For CIFAR-10:
  > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. Technical Report 0, University of Toronto, 2009. URL: https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/learning-features-2009-TR.pdf.
  
- For Cora:
  > Thomas Kipf and Max Welling. *Semi-Supervised Classification with Graph Convolutional Networks*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR), 2017.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, including their names, descriptions, and citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference.

This step-by-step approach ensures that I thoroughly extract all relevant datasets from the paper while maintaining proper citation practices.
