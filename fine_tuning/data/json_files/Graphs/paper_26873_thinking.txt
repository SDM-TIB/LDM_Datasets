To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Mesh-Based Simulation with Graph Networks" by Tobias Pfaff et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for evaluation. In the introduction, the authors often discuss the context of their work, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experimental Domains)**, as this section typically contains detailed information about the datasets used in the experiments. Here, the authors describe various datasets, including their characteristics and the systems they simulate.

In this section, I identify the following datasets:

1. **FLAGSIMPLE**: This dataset is used for simulating a simple cloth scenario. It is described as having a regular mesh type and consists of 400 steps with a specific time step for simulation.

2. **FLAGDYNAMIC**: This dataset involves a dynamic cloth simulation where the mesh changes resolution over time. It consists of 250 steps and is also simulated using a triangular mesh.

3. **SPHEREDYNAMIC**: Similar to FLAGDYNAMIC, this dataset involves a dynamic simulation of cloth interacting with a sphere, with 500 steps.

4. **DEFORMINGPLATE**: This dataset simulates a hyper-elastic plate deformed by an actuator, using a tetrahedral mesh and consisting of 400 steps.

5. **CYLINDERFLOW**: This dataset simulates incompressible fluid flow around a cylinder using a triangular mesh, consisting of 600 steps.

6. **AIRFOIL**: This dataset simulates compressible fluid dynamics around an airfoil, also using a triangular mesh and consisting of 600 steps.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset. The citations may not always be explicitly listed as datasets but can often be found in the context of the methods or tools used to generate the datasets.

For the datasets mentioned, I will compile the following citations:

- **FLAGSIMPLE**:

Finally, I will summarize the extracted datasets and their citations in a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly identified along with its corresponding citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
