To extract datasets from the research paper titled "peerRTF: Robust MVDR Beamforming Using Graph Convolutional Network" by Daniel Levi, Amit Sofer, and Sharon Gannot, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and it may mention specific datasets used for training or testing. 

Next, I will focus on the **experimental setup section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used in their experiments. In this paper, the authors mention the **MIRaGe dataset**, which is crucial for their experiments. I will look for details about this dataset, such as its structure, the number of recordings, and the conditions under which it was collected.

In the **experimental setup section**, the authors describe the MIRaGe dataset as comprising measured multichannel signals recorded in a controlled environment. They specify that the dataset includes recordings from a loudspeaker placed at various positions within a cube-shaped volume, which is essential for understanding the dataset's context.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the MIRaGe dataset. The authors reference the dataset as follows:
> J. Čmejla, T. Kounovský, S. Gannot, Z. Koldovský, and P. Tandeitnik. *MIRaGe: multichannel database of room impulse responses measured on high-resolution cube-shaped grid*. In 28th European Signal Proc. Conference (EUSIPCO), 2021, pp. 56–60.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the dataset details:

1. **MIRaGe Dataset**: This dataset consists of multichannel recordings made in a controlled acoustic environment, specifically designed to study the behavior of microphone arrays. The recordings were made at various positions within a cube-shaped volume, allowing for a comprehensive analysis of room acoustics.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including the full citation, ensuring that it is ready for any required structured output or further processing.
