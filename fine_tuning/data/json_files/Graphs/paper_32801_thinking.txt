To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ADMET property prediction through combinations of molecular fingerprints" by James H. Notwell and Michael W. Wood, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors validated their model across **22 Therapeutics Data Commons (TDC) ADMET benchmarks**. This indicates that there are multiple datasets involved, which I need to identify.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methods** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors refer to the **Therapeutics Data Commons (TDC)** benchmarks, which are crucial for understanding the datasets used.

In the **Summary** section, the authors state that they applied their model to **22 benchmarks across different ADMET property prediction tasks**. This suggests that each benchmark corresponds to a specific dataset related to ADMET properties, such as aqueous solubility or cytochrome P450 enzyme inhibition.

To gather detailed information about these datasets, I will check the **References section** for any citations related to the TDC benchmarks. The paper does not provide individual citations for each benchmark but refers to the TDC as a source. Therefore, I will cite the TDC as a whole.

The citation for the Therapeutics Data Commons is:
> Huang, K., Fu, T., Gao, W., Zhao, Y., Roohani, Y., Leskovec, J., Coley, C. W., Xiao, C., Sun, J., & Zitnik, M. (2022). Artificial intelligence foundation for therapeutic science. *Nature Chemical Biology*, 18(10), 1033â€“1036. doi: 10.1038/s41589-022-01131-2. URL: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41589-022-01131-2.

Now, I will summarize the datasets extracted from the paper:

1. **Therapeutics Data Commons (TDC) ADMET Benchmarks**: A collection of 22 benchmarks for various ADMET property prediction tasks, including but not limited to aqueous solubility and cytochrome P450 enzyme inhibition.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines the datasets and their citations, ensuring that all necessary details are included for future reference or analysis.
