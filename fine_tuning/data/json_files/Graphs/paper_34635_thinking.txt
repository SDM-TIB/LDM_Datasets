To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Culturally Aware and Adapted NLP: A Taxonomy and a Survey of the State of the Art" by Chen Cecilia Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a high-level overview, while the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the datasets used in the research.

Next, I will focus on the **main body of the paper**, particularly sections that discuss resources, datasets, or experiments. I will look for explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, descriptions, and any relevant statistics (e.g., size, number of samples, languages covered).

In this paper, I will pay special attention to sections that categorize datasets based on cultural elements, as this may indicate the presence of multiple datasets. For example, the authors mention various cultural elements such as concepts, knowledge, values, norms, and artifacts, which may correspond to specific datasets.

As I identify datasets, I will take note of their full citations, which are typically found in the **References section** of the paper. This is crucial for ensuring that I provide accurate and complete citations for each dataset.

For instance, if the paper mentions datasets like "CANDLE" or "MMLU," I will locate their full citations in the references. The citation format usually includes the authors, title, conference or journal name, and publication year.

Once I have gathered all the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset's name, description, and citation. This will ensure that the extracted information is organized and ready for further analysis or use.

Finally, I will review the extracted information to confirm its accuracy and completeness before finalizing the dataset entries.
