To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Adaptive Graph Normalized Sign Algorithm" by Changran Peng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on graph-based temperature data, which suggests that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section (IV)**, where the authors describe the dataset used for testing their proposed algorithm. They mention that the dataset consists of **95 hourly temperatures collected from 197 weather stations**. This is a clear indication of a dataset, and I need to gather more details about it.

The authors also reference a specific source for the dataset in the experiments section, which is crucial for citation purposes. They cite the dataset as coming from the NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information, specifically the "U.S. hourly climate normals (1991-2020)."

Now, I will consult the **References section** to retrieve the full citation for this dataset. The citation provided in the references is:

> M. Palecki, et al. “U.S. hourly climate normals (1991-2020),” NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information, 2020.

With this information, I can summarize the dataset as follows:

1. **Dataset Name**: U.S. Hourly Climate Normals (1991-2020)
   - **Description**: A dataset containing hourly temperature data collected from 197 weather stations across the U.S. The data is used for predicting temperature under impulsive noise conditions.
   - **Citation**: M. Palecki, et al. “U.S. hourly climate normals (1991-2020),” NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information, 2020.

After compiling this information, I will prepare the dataset entry in the required format for further processing or review. This structured approach ensures that I accurately capture all necessary details and citations for the dataset mentioned in the paper.
