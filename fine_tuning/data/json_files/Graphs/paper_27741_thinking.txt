To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Survey and Perspective on Social Emotions in Robotics" by Chie Hieida and Takayuki Nagai, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections that discuss methodologies and findings** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a general overview, but I will need to look for specific mentions of datasets in the body of the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **sections that summarize previous research and surveys**. These sections often contain references to datasets used in the studies being reviewed. For instance, I will look for tables or figures that might list datasets or provide summaries of studies that utilized specific datasets.

In the paper, I will pay particular attention to **Table 5**, which summarizes social emotions and their associated research. This table may reference datasets used in the studies listed. I will also check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned in the text or tables.

As I identify datasets, I will note their names, descriptions, and any relevant details such as the number of samples or specific characteristics that define them. I will also ensure to capture the full citation for each dataset as it appears in the references.

For example, if I find a dataset mentioned in the context of emotional recognition in robots, I will extract the name of the dataset, a brief description of its purpose, and the citation from the references.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets referenced in the paper.

Finally, I will organize this information clearly, ready for any further processing or review.
