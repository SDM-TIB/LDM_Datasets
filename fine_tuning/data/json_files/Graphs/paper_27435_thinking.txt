To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Single Underwater Image Restoration by Contrastive Learning" by Junlin Han et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant details, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions the release of a "large-scale real underwater image dataset" which indicates that a dataset is indeed present. The introduction further emphasizes the importance of having a large-scale dataset for training learning-based models, hinting at the dataset's significance.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (A Novel Dataset)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset they constructed. Here, they introduce the **Heron Island Coral Reef Dataset (HICRD)**, which contains raw underwater images from eight sites, along with metadata such as water types, maximum dive depth, and camera model. The dataset is described in detail, including the number of images categorized as low-quality, good-quality, and restored images, as well as the resolution of the images.

The dataset breakdown is as follows:
- **HICRD**: Contains 6003 low-quality images, 3673 good-quality images, and 2000 restored images. The dataset supports both paired and unpaired training sets, with a test set comprising 300 good-quality images and 300 paired restored images.

After identifying the dataset, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. However, the paper does not provide a separate citation for the HICRD dataset, as it is an original dataset created by the authors. Therefore, I will cite the paper itself as the source of the dataset.

The citation for the dataset will be:
> Junlin Han, Mehrdad Shoeiby, Tim Malthus, Elizabeth Botha, Janet Anstee, Saeed Anwar, Ran Wei, Lars Petersson, Mohammad Ali Armin. *Single Underwater Image Restoration by Contrastive Learning*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2023.

Now, I will compile the information about the dataset into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and the citation.

In summary, I have identified the **Heron Island Coral Reef Dataset (HICRD)** as the primary dataset in the paper, and I have gathered all necessary details to create a comprehensive entry for it, including the full citation.
