To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Sparse Nonnegative Tucker Decomposition and Completion under Noisy Observations" by Xiongjun Zhang and Michael K. Ng, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of numerical examples on both synthetic and real-world datasets, which indicates that there are datasets involved, but I need to find specific names and details.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments** section. In this paper, the authors mention using both synthetic datasets and real-world datasets, but I need to identify them explicitly. 

In the **experiments section**, the authors describe their numerical experiments using synthetic data and two specific datasets:
1. **Swimmer Dataset**: This dataset consists of 256 images of swimmers, each sized 32x32 pixels.
2. **Columbia Object Image Library (COIL-100)**: This dataset contains 100 objects, with images resized to 64x64 pixels.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The Swimmer dataset is referenced as:
- Stodden, V. (2020). Swimmer dataset. Retrieved from https://stodden.net/Papers.html

For the COIL-100 dataset, the citation is:
- N. Vaswani, "COIL-100 dataset," Columbia University, 2004. Retrieved from https://www.cs.columbia.edu/CAVE/software/softlib/coil-100.php

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations as required.

In summary, I have identified two datasets from the paper:
1. **Swimmer Dataset**: 256 images of swimmers, each 32x32 pixels.
   - Citation: Stodden, V. (2020). Swimmer dataset. Retrieved from https://stodden.net/Papers.html
2. **Columbia Object Image Library (COIL-100)**: 100 objects, images resized to 64x64 pixels.
   - Citation: N. Vaswani, "COIL-100 dataset," Columbia University, 2004. Retrieved from https://www.cs.columbia.edu/CAVE/software/softlib/coil-100.php

Now, I will prepare to format this information according to the specified requirements.
