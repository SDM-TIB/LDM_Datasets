To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Indoor Panorama Planar 3D Reconstruction via Divide and Conquer" by Cheng Sun et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to find any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the creation of a benchmark for indoor panorama planar reconstruction, specifically referring to the "PanoH&V" dataset. This indicates that there is a dataset of interest.

Next, I will examine **section 3 (PanoH&V dataset)**, where the authors describe the construction of the PanoH&V dataset. They state that it is derived from three public 360° RGB-D datasets: **Matterport3D**, **Stanford2D3D**, and **Structured3D**. This section provides crucial details about the datasets used to create the PanoH&V dataset.

In **section 3.1 (Panorama dataset sources)**, the authors specify the three datasets used:
1. **Matterport3D**: A large-scale dataset containing RGB-D data in indoor environments.
2. **Stanford2D3D**: Another dataset that provides RGB-D data for indoor scene understanding.
3. **Structured3D**: A synthetic dataset that also includes RGB-D data.

The authors explain how these datasets were utilized to create the PanoH&V dataset, which focuses on horizontal and vertical planes in 360° images.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to gather the full citations for each of these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **Matterport3D**, the citation is:
  > Angel X. Chang, Angela Dai, Thomas A. Funkhouser, Maciej Halber, Matthias Nießner, Manolis Savva, Shuran Song, Andy Zeng, and Yinda Zhang. *Matterport3D: learning from RGB-D data in indoor environments*. In 2017 International Conference on 3D Vision, 3DV 2017, Qingdao, China, October 10-12, 2017, pages 667–676, 2017.

- For **Stanford2D3D**, the citation is:
  > Iro Armeni, Sasha Sax, Amir Roshan Zamir, and Silvio Savarese. *Joint 2d-3d-semantic data for indoor scene understanding*. CoRR, abs/1702.01105, 2017.

- For **Structured3D**, the citation is:
  > Jia Zheng, Junfei Zhang, Jing Li, Rui Tang, Shenghua Gao, and Zihan Zhou. *Structured3D: A large photo-realistic dataset for structured 3d modeling*. CoRR, abs/1908.00222, 2019.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets referenced in the paper, which is essential for any further analysis or replication of the study.
