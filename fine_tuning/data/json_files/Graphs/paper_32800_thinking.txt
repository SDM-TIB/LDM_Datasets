To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Self-supervised Learning for Anomaly Detection in Computational Workflows" by Hongwei Jin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant details, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors demonstrate their method on benchmark datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this paper, they mention using **Flow-Bench**, which is a benchmark dataset for anomaly detection in scientific workflows. I will look for specific details about this dataset, such as its structure, the number of executions, and the types of workflows included.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide a table summarizing the dataset descriptions, including the number of Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) executions for three workflows: **1000 Genome**, **Montage**, and **Predict Future Sales**. Each workflow has specific details about the number of nodes, edges, and the number of normal and anomalous executions.

1. **1000 Genome Workflow**: This dataset is derived from the 1000 Genomes Project, which provides a reference for human genetic variation. The workflow identifies mutational overlaps using data from this project.

2. **Montage Workflow**: This dataset involves astronomical image processing and is used to create mosaics from images captured by the Digitized Sky Survey.

3. **Predict Future Sales Workflow**: This dataset is based on a Kaggle competition and involves predicting sales using historical sales data.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **1000 Genomes Project**, the citation is:
  > 1000 Genomes Project Consortium. "A global reference for human genetic variation." *Nature*, vol. 526, no. 7571, pp. 68â€“74, 2012.

- For the **Digitized Sky Survey**, the citation is:
  > Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy. "Digitized sky survey," 1994. Available: https://catcopy.ipac.caltech.edu/dois/doi.php?id=10.26131/IRSA441.

- For the **Predict Future Sales dataset**, the citation is:
  > Kaggle. "Predict Future Sales," 2020. Available: https://www.kaggle.com/c/competitive-data-science-predict-future-sales.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described accurately and includes the full citation as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
