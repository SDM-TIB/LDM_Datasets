To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Rethinking Kernel Methods for Node Representation Learning on Graphs" by Yu Tian et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their approach on "a number of standard node classification benchmarks," which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 6), where the authors provide details about the datasets used for evaluation. They specifically mention three benchmark datasets: **Cora**, **Citeseer**, and **Pubmed**. I will extract the relevant details about each dataset, including the number of nodes, edges, classes, features, and the data split settings.

In the paper, the authors summarize the datasets in **Table 1**, which provides a clear overview of the statistics for each dataset. Here are the details I will extract:

1. **Cora Dataset**: 
   - Nodes: 2,708
   - Edges: 5,429
   - Classes: 7
   - Features: 1,433
   - Data split settings: 1,208 / 500 / 1,000 (train/validation/test)

2. **Citeseer Dataset**: 
   - Nodes: 3,327
   - Edges: 4,732
   - Classes: 6
   - Features: 3,703
   - Data split settings: 1,624 / 542 / 542 (train/validation/test)

3. **Pubmed Dataset**: 
   - Nodes: 19,717
   - Edges: 44,338
   - Classes: 3
   - Features: 500
   - Data split settings: 18,217 / 500 / 1,000 (train/validation/test)

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **Cora Dataset**:
  > McCallum, A. K., Nigam, K., Rennie, J., & Seymore, K. (2000). Automating the construction of internet portals with machine learning. *Information Retrieval*, 3(2), 127-163.

- For **Citeseer Dataset**:
  > Giles, C. L., Bollacker, K. D., & Lawrence, S. (1998). Citeseer: An automatic citation indexing system. In *Proceedings of the Third ACM Conference on Digital Libraries* (pp. 89-98).

- For **Pubmed Dataset**:
  > Sen, P., Namata, G., Bilgic, M., Getoor, L., Galligher, B., & Eliassi-Rad, T. (2008). Collective classification in network data. *AI Magazine*, 29(3), 93-93.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or analysis.
