To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ST2Vec: Spatio-Temporal Trajectory Similarity Learning in Road Networks" by Ziquan Fang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments using **three real-world datasets**, which indicates that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental section (Section V)**, where the authors describe their experimental settings. They explicitly state that they used three public real-life trajectory datasets for their evaluations: **T-Drive, Rome, and Xi’an**. I will take note of the details provided for each dataset, including their characteristics and the context in which they were used.

1. **T-Drive Dataset**: The authors mention that this dataset contains 15 million taxi trajectory points from Beijing, China, collected over a week in February 2008. This dataset is significant for trajectory analysis in urban settings.

2. **Rome Dataset**: This dataset consists of 367,052 trajectories from taxis in Rome, Italy, covering a period of over 30 days. It provides a rich source of trajectory data for studying transportation patterns in a different urban environment.

3. **Xi’an Dataset**: The authors describe this dataset as containing 806,482 trajectories collected during one week by the DiDi company in Xi’an, China. This dataset adds diversity to the analysis by including data from another geographical location.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

- For the **T-Drive Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Microsoft Research. *T-Drive: Trajectory Data Sample*. Available at: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/t-drive-trajectory-data-sample/

- For the **Rome Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Crawdad. *Rome Taxi Trajectory Dataset*. Available at: https://crawdad.org/roma/taxi/20140717/

- For the **Xi’an Dataset**, the citation is:
  > DiDi. *Xi’an Trajectory Dataset*. Available at: https://outreach.didichuxing.com/research/opendata/

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
