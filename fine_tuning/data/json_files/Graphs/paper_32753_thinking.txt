To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Graph Neural Prompting with Large Language Models" by Yijun Tian et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that extensive experiments were conducted on multiple datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this paper, the authors mention conducting experiments on both commonsense reasoning and biomedical reasoning tasks. They specifically list the datasets used for these tasks.

In the **experiments section**, I find the following datasets mentioned:

1. **OpenBookQA (OBQA)**: This dataset is used for commonsense reasoning and is referenced as a significant benchmark in the paper.

2. **AI2 Reasoning Challenge (ARC)**: Another commonsense reasoning dataset that is utilized in the experiments.

3. **Physical Interaction Question Answering (PIQA)**: This dataset is also mentioned as part of the commonsense reasoning evaluation.

4. **RiddleSense**: A dataset that focuses on reasoning about riddle questions, included in the commonsense reasoning experiments.

5. **PubMedQA**: This dataset is used for biomedical reasoning tasks, specifically for question answering in the biomedical domain.

6. **BioASQ**: Another biomedical reasoning dataset that is referenced in the context of the experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for each of these datasets:

- For **OpenBookQA (OBQA)**, the citation is:
  > Mihaylov, T., Clark, P., Khot, T., & Sabharwal, A. (2018). *Can a suit of armor conduct electricity? A new dataset for open book question answering*. In EMNLP.

- For **AI2 Reasoning Challenge (ARC)**, the citation is:
  > Clark, P., Cowhey, I., Etzioni, O., Khot, T., Sabharwal, A., Schoenick, C., & Tafjord, O. (2018). *Think you have solved question answering? Try ARC, the AI2 reasoning challenge*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1803.05457.

- For **Physical Interaction Question Answering (PIQA)**, the citation is:
  > Bisk, Y., Zellers, R., Gao, J., & Choi, Y. (2020). *PIQA: Reasoning about physical commonsense in natural language*. In AAAI.

- For **RiddleSense**, the citation is:
  > Lin, B. Y., Wu, Z., Yang, Y., Lee, D.-H., & Ren, X. (2021). *RiddleSense: Reasoning about riddle questions featuring linguistic creativity and commonsense knowledge*. In ACL-IJCNLP.

- For **PubMedQA**, the citation is:
  > Jin, Q., Dhingra, B., Liu, Z., Cohen, W. W., & Lu, X. (2019). *PubMedQA: A dataset for biomedical research question answering*. In EMNLP.

- For **BioASQ**, the citation is:
  > Tsatsaronis, G., Balikas, G., Malakasiotis, P., Partalas, I., Zschunke, M., Alvers, M. R., Weissenborn, D., Krithara, A., & Polychronopoulos, D. (2015). *An overview of the BIOASQ large-scale biomedical semantic indexing and question answering competition*. BMC bioinformatics.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its full citation for clarity and proper attribution.
