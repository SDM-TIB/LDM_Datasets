To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Leveraging Intra-modal and Inter-modal Interaction for Multi-Modal Entity Alignment" by Zhiwei Hu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that extensive experiments were conducted on two real-world datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed present. I will look for specific names or descriptions of these datasets.

Next, I will check the **experiments section** (Section 5) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they mention two datasets: **FB15K-DB15K** and **FB15K-YAGO15K**. I will note down the details provided about these datasets, including the number of alignment pairs they contain.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide a complete context for future researchers.

For the **FB15K-DB15K dataset**, the citation is:
> Liyi Chen, Zhi Li, Yijun Wang, Tong Xu, Zhefeng Wang, and Enhong Chen. *MMEA: Entity Alignment for Multi-modal Knowledge Graph*. In KSEM. Springer, Hangzhou, China, 134–147, 2020.

For the **FB15K-YAGO15K dataset**, the citation is:
> Farzaneh Mahdisoltani, Joanna Biega, and Fabian M. Suchanek. *YAGO3: A Knowledge Base from Multilingual Wikipedias*. In CIDR. www.cidrdb.org, Asilomar, the United States, 1–12, 2015.

Now that I have the dataset names and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset along with its citation. This will ensure that the datasets are accurately represented and easily accessible for future reference.
