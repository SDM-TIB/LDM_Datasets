To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fine-Grained Off-Road Semantic Segmentation and Mapping via Contrastive Learning" by Biao Gao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to gather initial insights about any datasets referenced. The abstract mentions that experiments were conducted on a dataset of three driving segments representing diverse off-road scenes, which indicates that a specific dataset is being utilized.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental results section** where the authors provide detailed statistics about the dataset. In **Table I**, they describe the dataset, which consists of three subsets (A, B, and C) with specific details about the number of frames and anchor patches. This table is crucial as it provides quantitative information about the dataset.

The paper states that the dataset contains over 12,000 image frames across three driving segments, which is significant for understanding the scale and diversity of the dataset. Each subset has a different number of frames and anchor patches, which I will note down.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. However, in this case, the authors do not provide a specific citation for the off-road dataset they developed, as it appears to be a novel contribution of their research. Therefore, I will document the dataset as follows:

1. **Off-Road Dataset**: This dataset is developed by the authors and contains over 12,000 image frames from three driving segments. The dataset is used for evaluating the proposed method and includes human-annotated anchor patches for training.

Since there is no external citation for this dataset, I will note it as an original dataset created for the study.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and any relevant statistics that were provided in the paper. This will ensure that the dataset extraction is thorough and well-documented for future reference or analysis.
