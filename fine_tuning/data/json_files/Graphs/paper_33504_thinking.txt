To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Exploiting Data Hierarchy as a New Modality for Contrastive Learning" by Arjun Bhalla et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and dataset sections** to locate any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract mentions the **WikiScenes dataset**, which is a strong indication that this dataset is central to the research.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Dataset)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the **WikiScenes dataset**. They describe it as consisting of data from 99 cathedrals, with images associated with various hierarchical components. This section is crucial as it outlines the dataset's structure and its relevance to the study.

In **subsection 3.1 (WikiScenes Dataset)**, the authors elaborate on the dataset's characteristics, including the hierarchical organization of cathedral components and the different modalities included (images, image descriptions, and 3D image correspondence). This detailed description confirms that the **WikiScenes dataset** is the primary dataset used in their experiments.

Additionally, in **subsection 3.2 (Contrastive Training Dataset Construction)**, the authors discuss how they constructed datasets of varying sizes (small, medium, and large) based on the WikiScenes dataset. This indicates that they utilized different subsets of the WikiScenes dataset for their experiments, but the core dataset remains the same.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the **WikiScenes dataset**. The authors reference Elor et al. [6] for granting access to the dataset, so I will look for the corresponding citation in the references.

The citation for the **WikiScenes dataset** is:
> Elor, H., Sun, J., & Snavely, N. (2017). Towers of Babel: Combining images, language, and 3D geometry for multimodal vision. Work in progress.

Since the authors do not provide a separate citation for the WikiScenes dataset itself, I will use the citation for the work that provided access to it.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the **WikiScenes dataset** as it is critical for proper attribution.

After completing these steps, I will have a clear and concise entry for the dataset used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
