To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Certifying Robustness of Graph Convolutional Networks for Node Perturbation with Polyhedra Abstract Interpretation" by Boqi Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and it may mention specific datasets used for experiments or evaluations.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors often discuss the context of their work and may reference datasets that are relevant to their research. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or benchmarks.

Then, I will examine the **experiments section**, which typically contains detailed information about the datasets used for evaluation. This section is crucial as it usually lists the datasets along with their characteristics, such as size, type, and any specific features relevant to the study.

In this paper, the authors mention that they conducted experiments on three popular node classification datasets: **Citeseer, Cora, and PubMed**. I will note down these datasets and look for any specific details provided about them, such as the number of nodes, edges, features, and labels.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is important for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

For the datasets mentioned:
1. **Citeseer**: I will look for the original paper or source that introduced this dataset to provide a complete citation.
2. **Cora**: Similarly, I will find the original reference for this dataset.
3. **PubMed**: I will also locate the citation for this dataset.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset information in a structured format, ready for further processing or review.
