To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Debiased Contrastive Learning of Unsupervised Sentence Representations" by Kun Zhou et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on "seven semantic textual similarity tasks," which suggests that there are datasets associated with these tasks. I need to identify these datasets explicitly.

Next, I will look into **section 5 (Experiment)**, where the authors describe their experimental setup. They mention evaluating their approach on "seven standard STS tasks," specifically naming the datasets used for these tasks. I will carefully note down the names of these datasets and any relevant details provided.

The paper lists the following datasets in **section 5.1 (Experiment Setup)**:

1. **STS 2012**: This dataset is part of the Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) tasks and is used for evaluating sentence similarity.
2. **STS 2013**: Another dataset from the STS tasks, used for similar evaluations.
3. **STS 2014**: This dataset continues the trend of evaluating semantic textual similarity.
4. **STS 2015**: Yet another dataset in the series, contributing to the evaluation of sentence representations.
5. **STS 2016**: This dataset is also part of the STS tasks.
6. **STS Benchmark**: A benchmark dataset for evaluating semantic textual similarity.
7. **SICK-Relatedness**: This dataset is used for measuring semantic relatedness between sentences.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the STS datasets are as follows:

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations, ensuring that each dataset is clearly documented with its full citation for future reference or processing.
