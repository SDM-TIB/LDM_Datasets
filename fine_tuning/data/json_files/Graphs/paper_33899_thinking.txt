To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Enhancing Information Maximization with Distance-Aware Contrastive Learning for Source-Free Cross-Domain Few-Shot Learning" by Huali Xu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions evaluations on **4 datasets in the BSCD-FSL benchmark**, which indicates that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will look specifically in the **experiments section** where the authors describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, they mention the following datasets:

1. **CropDiseases Dataset**: This dataset comprises around 87,000 images of 38 crop leaf types, both healthy and diseased.

2. **EuroSAT Dataset**: This dataset offers 27,000 labeled images across 10 land use categories with a resolution of 64x64 pixels.

3. **ISIC 2018 Dataset**: This dataset contains 2,594 dermoscopic images spanning 7 categories.

4. **ChestX Dataset**: This dataset features 112,120 X-ray images from 30,805 patients, annotated for 14 diseases.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:

- For **CropDiseases Dataset**:

Now that I have the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use. This process ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their respective citations from the research paper.
