To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SHGNN: Structure-Aware Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network" by Wentao Xu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on benchmark datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly state that they evaluated their method on three benchmark heterogeneous graph datasets: **IMDB, DBLP, and ACM**. This section provides a summary of the datasets, including the types of nodes and their counts, which is crucial for understanding the context of the experiments.

In **Table 1**, the authors provide statistics for each dataset, which includes the number of nodes and edges, as well as the types of nodes present in each dataset. This information is essential for a comprehensive understanding of the datasets used.

The paper also includes detailed descriptions of each dataset in the **5.1 Datasets** subsection:

1. **IMDB**: This dataset consists of 4278 movies, 2081 directors, and 5257 actors. It is derived from an online database of movies and television programs, and the movies are classified into three genres: Action, Comedy, and Drama.

2. **DBLP**: This dataset includes 4057 authors, 14328 papers, 7723 terms, and 20 publication venues. It is a subset of a computer science bibliography website, with authors categorized into four research areas.

3. **ACM**: This dataset comprises 4019 papers, 7167 authors, and 60 subjects. It includes a collection of all ACM publications, and the papers are classified into three classes.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are typically provided in the context of the datasets' original sources or related works. 

For the IMDB dataset, the citation is:
> [10] Yizhou Sun, Jiawei Han, Xifeng Yan, Philip S Yu, and Tianyi Wu. *Pathsim: Meta path-based top-k similarity search in heterogeneous information networks*. Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment 4, 11 (2011), 992–1003.

For the DBLP dataset, the citation is:
> [10] Yizhou Sun, Jiawei Han, Xifeng Yan, Philip S Yu, and Tianyi Wu. *Pathsim: Meta path-based top-k similarity search in heterogeneous information networks*. Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment 4, 11 (2011), 992–1003.

For the ACM dataset, the citation is:
> [15] Di Jin, Cuiying Huo, Chundong Liang, and Liang Yang. *Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network via Attribute Completion*. In Proceedings of the Web Conference 2021. 391–400.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described with its respective citation, ready for structured output or further processing.
