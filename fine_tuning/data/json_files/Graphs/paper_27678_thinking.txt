To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Self-Supervision for Video Identification of Individual Holstein-Friesian Cattle: The Cows2021 Dataset" by Jing Gao et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the paper introduces the **Cows2021 dataset**, which is a significant indicator that this dataset is central to the research.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for further details about the dataset. The authors mention that the Cows2021 dataset is the largest identity-annotated dataset for Holstein-Friesian cattle, which reinforces its importance.

In the **dataset section (Section 2)**, the authors provide a detailed description of the Cows2021 dataset. They specify that it contains:
- **10,402 RGB images** with labels for localization and identity.
- **301 videos** from the same herd, captured in a specific environment.

The section also describes the acquisition process, the resolution of the images, and the annotations provided, which are crucial for understanding the dataset's structure and purpose.

I will also check the **experiments and results sections** to see if the dataset is used in any experiments or evaluations, which it is, as the authors discuss the performance of their self-supervision framework using this dataset.

Finally, I will look at the **references section** to find the full citation for the Cows2021 dataset. The authors provide a link to the dataset, which is essential for proper citation. The citation is as follows:
> Gao, J., Burghardt, T., Andrew, W., Dowsey, A. W., & Campbell, N. W. (2021). *Towards Self-Supervision for Video Identification of Individual Holstein-Friesian Cattle: The Cows2021 Dataset*. Available online at https://data.bris.ac.uk/data/dataset/10m32xl88x2b61zlkkgz3fml17.

Now, I will compile this information into a structured format that highlights the dataset's name, description, and citation, ensuring that all necessary details are included for future reference or processing.
