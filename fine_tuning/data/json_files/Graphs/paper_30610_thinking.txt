To extract datasets from the research paper titled "1-D Convolutional Graph Convolutional Networks for Fault Detection in Distributed Energy Systems" by Bang L.H. Nguyen et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors present a method for fault detection in microgrids and mention the use of a specific dataset, which is a good starting point.

Next, I will focus on **Section II (Graph Dataset of Potsdam Microgrid)**, where the authors describe the dataset in detail. They provide information about the structure of the dataset, including the adjacency matrix, node features, and the types of faults included. This section is crucial as it outlines the specifics of the dataset used for their experiments.

In this section, the authors mention the **Potsdam microgrid dataset**, which includes various parameters such as fault types, fault resistance, fault locations, and the total number of fault cases. They also provide details about the data collection process, including the sampling frequency and the method of data generation.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Potsdam microgrid dataset. However, since the dataset is generated by the authors themselves through real-time simulation using Opal-RT, it may not have a traditional citation like publicly available datasets. Instead, I will note that the dataset is based on their own simulation work.

The relevant details I will extract for the dataset are:
- **Dataset Name**: Potsdam Microgrid Dataset
- **Description**: A dataset generated from a real-time simulation of a 13-bus microgrid, including various fault scenarios and voltage measurements.
- **Parameters**: Fault types (AG, BG, CG, etc.), fault resistance (0.1, 1, 10 Î©), fault locations (buses 1-13), and total fault cases (64,350).
- **Data Collection Method**: Collected via real-time simulation using Opal-RT.

Since the dataset is not from a traditional source, I will note that the authors created it for their study, and I will summarize the information accordingly.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format that captures all the necessary details for further processing or review.
