To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Topology-aware Graph Neural Networks for Learning Feasible and Adaptive AC-OPF Solutions" by Shaohui Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and numerical results sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the development of a GNN approach for predicting optimal solutions for the AC-OPF problem but does not specify any datasets. 

Next, I will examine the **numerical results section** where the authors describe their experiments. They mention generating data samples using the **MATPOWER ac/dc-OPF solvers** on various test systems, specifically the **ieee118-bus, pegase1354-bus, and wp2383-bus systems** from the IEEE PES PGLib-OPF library. This indicates that these systems serve as datasets for their experiments.

I will also check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. The paper cites the following sources:

1. For the **MATPOWER** dataset:
   > R. D. Zimmerman, C. E. Murillo-Sanchez, and R. J. Thomas. *MATPOWER: Steady-state operations, planning, and analysis tools for power systems research and education*. IEEE Transactions on Power Systems, vol. 26, no. 1, pp. 12â€“19, 2011.

2. For the **IEEE PES PGLib-OPF library**:
   > S. Babaeinejadsarookolaee, A. Birchfield, R. D. Christie, C. Coffrin, C. DeMarco, R. Diao, M. Ferris, S. Fliscounakis, S. Greene, R. Huang et al. *The power grid library for benchmarking ac optimal power flow algorithms*. arXiv:1908.02788, 2019.

Now, I will compile the identified datasets along with their full citations. The datasets extracted from the paper are:

1. **ieee118-bus system**: A test system used for generating data samples in the experiments.
2. **pegase1354-bus system**: Another test system utilized for data generation.
3. **wp2383-bus system**: A third test system referenced in the experiments.

With the citations gathered, I will ensure that each dataset is documented with its respective citation for clarity and completeness. This structured approach will help in accurately representing the datasets used in the research.
