To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Superpixel Image Classification with Graph Attention Networks" by Pedro H. C. Avelar et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the methodology and mentions experiments on various datasets, which indicates that datasets are likely included.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. They mention four datasets:

1. **MNIST**: A well-known dataset containing grayscale images of handwritten digits, with a size of 28 × 28 pixels and 10 classes.

2. **FashionMNIST**: Similar to MNIST, this dataset contains grayscale images of clothing items, also sized at 28 × 28 pixels and consisting of 10 classes.

3. **Street View House Numbers (SVHN)**: This dataset consists of color images of house numbers from Google Street View, specifically the cropped version sized at 32 × 32 pixels.

4. **CIFAR-10**: A dataset containing 50,000 color images of size 32 × 32 pixels, categorized into 10 classes.

In the same section, the authors provide details about how they processed these datasets using their proposed methodology, confirming their use in the experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **MNIST**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun, Léon Bottou, Yoshua Bengio, and Patrick Haffner. *Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition*. Proceedings of the IEEE, 86(11):2278–2324, 1998.

- For **FashionMNIST**, the citation is:
  > Han Xiao, Kashif Rasul, and Roland Vollgraf. *Fashion-MNIST: A novel image dataset for benchmarking machine learning algorithms*. CoRR, abs/1708.07747, 2017.

- For **SVHN**, the citation is:
  > Yuval Netzer, Tao Wang, Adam Coates, Alessandro Bissacco, Bo Wu, and Andrew Y Ng. *Reading digits in natural images with unsupervised feature learning*. 2011.

- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton, et al. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*, 2009.

With this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
