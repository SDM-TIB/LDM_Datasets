To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Rethinking the Setting of Semi-supervised Learning on Graphs" by Ziang Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors propose a new benchmark called IGB, which consists of four datasets. This suggests that there are specific datasets that I need to look for.

Next, I will examine **section 3 (IGB: An Independent and Identically Distributed Graph Benchmark)**, where the authors describe the datasets included in IGB. They mention that IGB consists of four datasets: AMiner, Facebook, NELL, and Flickr. I will take note of the details provided for each dataset, including their characteristics and the context in which they are used.

In the **subsection 3.3 (Datasets)**, the authors provide specific information about each dataset:

1. **AMiner**: A co-authorship graph extracted from the AMiner system, where nodes represent authors and edges represent co-authorship. The dataset has 4,485 average nodes, 236,017 original size, and features indicating publication venues.

2. **Facebook**: A graph of official Facebook pages, where nodes are pages and edges represent mutual likes. It has 3,475 average nodes and 22,470 original size.

3. **NELL**: A knowledge graph dataset where nodes represent entities and edges represent relationships. It has 3,540 average nodes and 63,910 original size.

4. **Flickr**: A graph of photos uploaded to Flickr, where nodes are photos and edges indicate shared properties. It has 4,452 average nodes and 89,250 original size.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for future researchers.

- For **AMiner**, the citation is:
  > Jie Tang, Jing Zhang, Limin Yao, Juan-Zi Li, Li Zhang, and Zhong Su. *Arnetminer: extraction and mining of academic social networks*. In Proceedings of the ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, 2008.

- For **Facebook**, the citation is:
  > Benedek Rozemberczki, Carl Allen, and Rik Sarkar. *Multi-scale attributed node embedding*. CoRR, abs/1909.13021, 2019.

- For **NELL**, the citation is:
  > Andrew Carlson, Justin Betteridge, Bryan Kisiel, Burr Settles, Estevam R. Hruschka, and Tom Michael Mitchell. *Toward an architecture for never-ending language learning*. In Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, 2010.

- For **Flickr**, the citation is:
  > Hanqing Zeng, Hongkuan Zhou, Ajitesh Srivastava, Rajgopal Kannan, and Viktor K. Prasanna. *Graphsaint: Graph sampling based inductive learning method*. CoRR, abs/1907.04931, 2019.

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets and their respective citations from the paper.
