To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Unsupervised Feature Clustering Improves Contrastive Representation Learning for Medical Image Segmentation" by Yejia Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant details, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions experiments on "2D skin dermoscopic image segmentation" and "3D multi-class whole heart CT segmentation," indicating that there are specific datasets used for these tasks.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In the **Experiments and Results** section, the authors explicitly mention two datasets:

1. **ISIC Skin Lesion Dataset**: The authors refer to the ISIC'2017 dataset, which includes 2000 training images, 150 validation images, and 600 test images. They also mention using additional training images from ISIC's 2018 and 2020 challenges, totaling 45141 unlabeled samples after removing duplicates.

2. **MMWHS Heart CT Dataset**: The paper discusses the MMWHS'2017 dataset, which contains 20 CT volumes with 7 foreground classes. The authors describe their approach to cross-validation and preprocessing for this dataset.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **ISIC Skin Lesion Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Gutman, D. A., Codella, N. C. F., Celebi, M. E., Helba, B., Marchetti, M. A., Mishra, N. K., & Halpern, A. C. (2018). Skin lesion analysis toward melanoma detection: A challenge at the 2017 international symposium on biomedical imaging (ISBI), hosted by the international skin imaging collaboration (ISIC). In *ISBI*, pages 168–172.

- For the **MMWHS Heart CT Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Zhuang, X. (2013). Challenges and methodologies of fully automatic whole heart segmentation: a review. *Journal of Healthcare Engineering*, 4(3), 371–408.

After gathering this information, I will ensure that I accurately represent each dataset's details, including their names, descriptions, and citations, in the required format for further processing or review. This structured approach will help maintain clarity and ensure that all relevant information is captured effectively.
