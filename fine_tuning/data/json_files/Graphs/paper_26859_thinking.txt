To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Driver Anomaly Detection: A Dataset and Contrastive Learning Approach" by Okan Köpüklü et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract**. The authors introduce the **Driver Anomaly Detection (DAD) dataset**, which is a key component of their research. This indicates that I should look for more details about this dataset in the subsequent sections.

Next, I will move to the **introduction** section. Here, the authors elaborate on the significance of the DAD dataset, emphasizing its role in addressing the open set recognition problem in driver monitoring. They mention that the dataset includes normal driving videos and a variety of anomalous actions, which is crucial information for understanding its structure.

In the **Datasets section (Section 3)**, the authors provide a detailed description of the DAD dataset. They specify that it is a large-scale, multi-view, multi-modal dataset recorded using a driving simulator. The dataset includes recordings from 31 subjects, with specific details about the training and test sets, including the number of subjects, video lengths, and types of anomalous actions. This section is critical for extracting comprehensive information about the dataset.

I will also check the **experiments** section to see if the authors mention any other datasets used for comparison or validation. However, the primary focus appears to be on the DAD dataset.

Finally, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citation for the DAD dataset. Since the dataset is introduced in this paper, I will cite it as follows:

- **Driver Anomaly Detection (DAD) Dataset**:
  > Okan Köpüklü, Jiapeng Zheng, Hang Xu, and Gerhard Rigoll. *Driver Anomaly Detection: A Dataset and Contrastive Learning Approach*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2023.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset details into a structured format that highlights the key attributes of the DAD dataset, ensuring that the citation is included for reference. This will provide a clear and concise summary of the dataset as presented in the paper.
