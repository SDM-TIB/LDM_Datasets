To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Tensor Factorisation for Polypharmacy Side Effect Prediction" by Oliver Lloyd et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of a benchmark dataset for comparing tensor factorisation models against established techniques. This indicates that there is at least one dataset that is crucial for the experiments.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **methods** section, particularly where the authors describe their data preparation and the models they are using. In this section, they mention downloading raw data used by Decagon from the Stanford Network Analysis Project, which suggests that the Decagon dataset is one of the primary datasets utilized in their research.

I will also check the **results** and **discussion** sections for any additional datasets that may be referenced or compared. The authors discuss the performance of their models on the Decagon dataset, confirming its significance in their experiments.

Now, I will gather the necessary details about the datasets:

1. **Decagon Dataset**: This dataset is used for polypharmacy side effect prediction and is publicly available. The authors reference the original work by Zitnik et al. that introduced this dataset.

Next, I will locate the full citation for the Decagon dataset in the **references section** of the paper. The citation for the Decagon dataset is:

- Zitnik, M., Agrawal, M., & Leskovec, J. (2018). Modeling polypharmacy side effects with graph convolutional networks. *Bioinformatics*, 34(i457-i466). doi: 10.1093/bioinformatics/bty294.

After confirming the details and citation for the Decagon dataset, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and future reference.

In summary, the key steps I took were:
1. Read the abstract and introduction for initial dataset mentions.
2. Examine the methods section for specific datasets used.
3. Check the results and discussion for additional context.
4. Retrieve the full citation from the references section.

This systematic approach ensures that I accurately capture all relevant datasets and their citations from the research paper.
