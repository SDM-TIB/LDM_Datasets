To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On the Importance of Distractors for Few-Shot Classification" by Rajshekhar Das et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of a prior model trained on a large-sample base domain, which suggests that datasets are involved. I will look for specific mentions of datasets in these sections.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this paper, they mention evaluating their method on various datasets, specifically in the context of few-shot classification tasks.

In the **experiments section**, I will identify the datasets mentioned:
1. **miniImageNet**: This dataset is used as the base domain for training. It is a well-known dataset in few-shot learning research.
2. **CUB (Caltech-UCSD Birds 200)**: This dataset is used as a novel domain for few-shot classification tasks.
3. **Cars**: Another dataset mentioned for evaluation in the few-shot classification tasks.
4. **Places**: This dataset is also used as a novel domain for the experiments.
5. **Plantae**: This dataset is included as a novel domain for evaluation.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations I will extract are:
- For **miniImageNet**:
  > Vinyals, O., Blundell, C., Lillicrap, T., Kavukcuoglu, K., & Wierstra, D. (2016). Matching networks for one shot learning. In NIPS.

- For **CUB (Caltech-UCSD Birds 200)**:
  > Welinder, P., Branson, S., Mita, T., Wah, C., Schroff, F., Belongie, S., & Perona, P. (2010). Caltech-UCSD Birds 200. Technical Report CNS-TR-2010-001, California Institute of Technology.

- For **Cars**:
  > Krause, J., Stark, M., Deng, J., & Fei-Fei, L. (2013). 3D object representations for fine-grained categorization. In ICCV Workshops.

- For **Places**:
  > Zhou, B., Lapedriza, A., Khosla, A., Oliva, A., & Torralba, A. (2018). Places: A 10 million image database for scene recognition. TPAMI, 40(6), 1452-1464.

- For **Plantae**:
  > Van Horn, G., Mac Aodha, O., Song, Y., Cui, Y., Sun, C., Shepard, A., Perona, P., & Belongie, S. (2016). The iNaturalist species classification and detection dataset. In CVPR.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or processing.
