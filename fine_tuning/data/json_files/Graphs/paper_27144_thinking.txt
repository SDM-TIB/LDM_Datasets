To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Adversarial Permutation Guided Node Representations for Link Prediction" by Indradyumna Roy et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their method on several real-world datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, they explicitly list five datasets:

1. **Twitter Dataset**: A snapshot of a part of Twitter’s social network.
2. **Google+ Dataset**: A snapshot of a part of Google-Plus social network.
3. **Cora Dataset**: A snapshot of a citation network.
4. **Citeseer Dataset**: Another snapshot of a citation network.
5. **PB Dataset**: A network of US political blogs.

I will also check the **appendices** for any additional details about these datasets, including their characteristics and how they were used in the experiments. The paper provides some statistics about each dataset, such as the number of nodes, average degree, and diameter, which can be useful for understanding their scale and complexity.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations may not be explicitly listed for each dataset, but I can infer them based on the context provided in the paper. For example, the Twitter and Google+ datasets are often referenced in the literature, and I can find their citations from previous works.

Here are the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

- **Twitter Dataset**:
  > Leskovec, J., & Mcauley, J. J. (2012). Learning to discover social circles in ego networks. In Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS).

- **Google+ Dataset**:
  > Leskovec, J., Chakrabarti, D., Kleinberg, J., Faloutsos, C., & Ghahramani, Z. (2010). Kronecker graphs: An approach to modeling networks. Journal of Machine Learning Research, 11(Feb), 985–1042.

- **Cora Dataset**:
  > Getoor, L. (2005). Link-based classification. In Advances in methods for knowledge discovery from complex data (pp. 189–207). Springer.

- **Citeseer Dataset**:
  > Getoor, L. (2005). Link-based classification. In Advances in methods for knowledge discovery from complex data (pp. 189–207). Springer.

- **PB Dataset**:
  > Ackland, R., et al. (2005). Mapping the US political blogosphere: Are conservative bloggers more prominent? In BlogTalk Downunder 2005 Conference, Sydney.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation, ready for further processing or review.
