To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Wireless Link Scheduling via Graph Representation Learning: A Comparative Study of Different Supervision Levels" by Navid Naderializadeh, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned or implied. The abstract discusses the use of graph representation learning for link scheduling in wireless networks, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine **section 4 (Empirical Evaluation of the Impact of Supervision Level on Trained Models)**, where the author describes the experiments conducted. Here, the author mentions generating training and testing samples for K-user interference channels, specifically stating that they generated a total of 256 training samples and 256 testing samples, all labeled using exhaustive search. However, the specific datasets or sources of these samples are not detailed in this section.

I will also check the **references section** to see if any datasets are cited or if any previous works provide datasets that were used in this study. The references include various papers related to wireless resource management and graph neural networks, but they do not explicitly mention datasets.

Since the paper does not provide specific dataset names or citations, I will summarize the information I have gathered:

1. **Training Samples**: The paper mentions generating 256 training samples and 256 testing samples for K-user interference channels, but it does not provide a specific dataset name or citation. The generation process involves using a dual-slope path-loss model and log-normal shadowing to create channel gains.

2. **Testing Samples**: Similar to the training samples, the testing samples are also generated using the same methodology, but again, no specific dataset name is provided.

Given that the paper does not reference any established datasets or provide full citations, I will note that the datasets used in this study are generated by the authors and do not have external citations.

In conclusion, I will compile the findings regarding the datasets, noting that they are generated samples without specific citations. If I were to format this information, I would ensure to clearly state that the datasets are not publicly available or cited from other sources.
