To extract datasets from the research paper titled "NAPA-VQ: Neighborhood Aware Prototype Augmentation with Vector Quantization for Continual Learning" by Tamasha Malepathirana, Damith Senanayake, and Saman Halgamuge, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on **CIFAR-100, TinyImageNet, ImageNet-Subset, and ImageNet-1K datasets**, which suggests that these datasets are crucial to their research.

Next, I will look specifically at **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors provide a detailed list of the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention:

1. **CIFAR-100**: A dataset containing 60,000 32x32 color images in 100 classes, with 600 images per class.
2. **TinyImageNet**: A smaller version of the ImageNet dataset, containing 200 classes with 500 training images per class.
3. **ImageNet-Subset**: A subset of the larger ImageNet dataset, used for specific experiments.
4. **ImageNet-1K**: The full ImageNet dataset containing 1,000 classes, widely used for image classification tasks.

To ensure accuracy, I will also check the **References section** for full citations of these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **CIFAR-100**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton, and others. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. 2009.

- For **TinyImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Ya Le and Xuan Yang. *Tiny ImageNet Visual Recognition Challenge*. CS 231N, 7(7):3, 2015.

- For **ImageNet-Subset**, the citation is:
  > Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, and Li Fei-Fei. *Imagenet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In 2009 IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pages 248–255, 2009.

- For **ImageNet-1K**, the citation is the same as for ImageNet-Subset:
  > Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, and Li Fei-Fei. *Imagenet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In 2009 IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pages 248–255, 2009.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
