To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Motif-Driven Contrastive Learning of Graph Representations" by Shichang Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors pre-trained their model on the **ogbg-molhiv dataset**, which is a strong indication that this dataset is crucial to their research.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. In section 4.1, the authors state that they evaluated their model on several chemical property prediction benchmarks, specifically mentioning the **ogbg-molhiv dataset**. This dataset is described as containing 40,000 molecules, which is important for understanding the scale and application of their research.

In section 4.2, the authors provide a summary of the datasets used for evaluation, including:

1. **bace**: A dataset for qualitative binding results for a set of inhibitors of human Î²-secretase 1.
2. **bbbp**: A dataset for blood-brain barrier penetration (membrane permeability).
3. **clintox**: A dataset classifying drugs approved by the FDA and those that have failed clinical trials for toxicity reasons.
4. **hiv**: A dataset for experimentally measured abilities to inhibit HIV replication.
5. **sider**: A database of marketed drugs and adverse drug reactions (ADR), grouped into 27 system organ classes.
6. **tox21**: A dataset on toxicity data for 12 biological targets.
7. **toxcast**: A dataset based on over 600 in vitro high-throughput screenings.

I will now check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The **ogbg-molhiv dataset** is referenced as part of the Open Graph Benchmark (OGB), which is cited as follows:
> Weihua Hu, Matthias Fey, Marinka Zitnik, Yuxiao Dong, Hongyu Ren, Bowen Liu, Michele Catasta, and Jure Leskovec. *Open Graph Benchmark: Datasets for Machine Learning on Graphs*. arXiv:2005.00687, 2020.

For the other datasets, I will summarize their citations based on the context provided in the paper:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries with their full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented and properly cited for future reference.
