To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Simple Temporal Information Matching Mechanism for Entity Alignment Between Temporal Knowledge Graphs" by Li Cai et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that "Extensive experiments on public datasets indicate that our supervised method significantly outperforms the previous methods," which suggests that datasets are used for evaluation. I will look for specific names of datasets in these sections.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 5), where the authors typically describe the datasets used in their experiments. In this section, they explicitly mention four datasets:

1. **DICEWS**: This dataset is built from ICEWS05-15 and contains events from 2005 to 2015. The authors refer to two subsets: DICEWS-1K and DICEWS-200, with 1,000 and 200 alignment seeds, respectively.

2. **YAGO-WIKI50K**: This dataset extracts the top 50,000 entities from Wikidata and links them to their equivalent YAGO entities. It also has two subsets: YAGO-WIKI50K-5K and YAGO-WIKI50K-1K, differing in the number of alignment seeds (5,000 and 1,000).

I will then check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and will be included in the dataset descriptions.

The citations I need to gather are:

- For **DICEWS**:
  > García-Durán, A., Dumancic, S., & Niepert, M. (2018). Learning sequence encoders for temporal knowledge graph completion. In Proceedings of the 2018 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (pp. 4816-4821). Association for Computational Linguistics.

- For **YAGO-WIKI50K**:
  > Lacroix, T., Obozinski, G., & Usunier, N. (2020). Tensor decompositions for temporal knowledge base completion. In 8th International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR 2020). OpenReview.net.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details and that the citations are accurate and complete.
