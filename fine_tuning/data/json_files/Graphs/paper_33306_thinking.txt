To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Toward Energy-Efficient Massive MIMO: Graph Neural Network Precoding for Mitigating Non-Linear PA Distortion" by Thomas Feys et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and while it may not explicitly mention datasets, it can give hints about the experiments conducted.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section V) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for validation and testing. In this section, I will look for any specific datasets that are referenced, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

I will also check the **references section** at the end of the paper to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. This is crucial as it provides the necessary details for proper attribution.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention using a **modified Rapp model** for their experiments, but they do not specify a dataset in the traditional sense (like a publicly available dataset). Instead, they describe the simulation setup and parameters used for their experiments.

Since the paper does not provide explicit datasets, I will note that the authors generated channels sampled from a complex normal distribution for their simulations. However, this does not constitute a dataset in the conventional sense.

In summary, I will document the following:

1. **Generated Channels**: The authors used a simulated channel model based on a complex normal distribution with zero mean and variance one. This is not a publicly available dataset but rather a simulation setup.

2. **Modified Rapp Model**: The paper discusses using a modified Rapp model for the power amplifier, which is relevant for understanding the context of the experiments but does not refer to a dataset.

Since there are no specific datasets mentioned in the paper, I will conclude that there are no datasets to extract in the traditional sense, but I will document the simulation parameters and models used for clarity.

Finally, I will ensure to provide a clear citation for the paper itself:
> Thomas Feys, Liesbet Van der Perre, Fran√ßois Rottenberg. *Toward Energy-Efficient Massive MIMO: Graph Neural Network Precoding for Mitigating Non-Linear PA Distortion*. [Journal/Conference Name], [Year].

This will serve as a reference for the methods and models discussed in the paper.
