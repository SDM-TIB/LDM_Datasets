To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Spectral Augmentations for Graph Contrastive Learning" by Amur Ghose et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly **section 5**, where the authors summarize the datasets used for pre-training and downstream tasks. Here, I will look for any tables or lists that explicitly detail the datasets, including their names, sizes, and any relevant characteristics.

In **Table 2**, the authors list several datasets for pre-training, including:

1. **DBLP (SNAP)**: This dataset contains 540,486 nodes and 317,080 edges.
2. **Academia**: This dataset has 30,491,458 nodes and 2,099,732 edges.
3. **DBLP (NetRep)**: This dataset includes 137,969 nodes and 739,384 edges.
4. **IMDB**: This dataset consists of 896,305 nodes and 7,564,894 edges.
5. **Facebook**: This dataset has 3,097,165 nodes and 47,334,788 edges.
6. **LiveJournal**: This dataset contains 4,843,953 nodes and 85,691,368 edges.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations may not always be directly provided in the text, so I will look for any references that correspond to the datasets mentioned.

For example, if the authors reference a dataset like the **DBLP dataset**, I will find the corresponding citation in the references, which might look something like this:

- **DBLP (SNAP)**: 
  > Leskovec, J., & Krevl, A. (2014). *Snap Datasets: Stanford Large Network Dataset Collection*. Retrieved from http://snap.stanford.edu/data

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation.

Finally, I will ensure that all extracted information is accurate and formatted correctly for any further processing or review.
