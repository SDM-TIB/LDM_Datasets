To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Skeleton-based Action Recognition of People Handling Objects" by Kimin Yun et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments using an open benchmark and their own datasets, which suggests that there are specific datasets to look for.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention two datasets:

1. **IRD Dataset**: This dataset is constructed for monitoring illegal rubbish dumping and contains videos from CCTV cameras. It includes 1374 video clips, with annotations for actions such as garbage dumping and normal events. The dataset is noted for its realistic data captured in unconstrained environments.

2. **ICVL-4 Dataset**: This dataset includes dynamic sub-actions of multiple people in surveillance scenes, divided into 13 categories. The authors specifically use classes related to object-related actions, such as phoning, smoking, texting, and dumping, for their experiments.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For the **IRD Dataset**, since it is a new dataset introduced by the authors, I will create a citation based on the information provided in the paper:
> Kimin Yun, Sunoh Kim, Jin Young Choi, Jongyoul Park. *Illegal Rubbish Dumping (IRD) Dataset for Object-Related Human Action Recognition*. In Proceedings of the [Conference Name], [Year].

For the **ICVL-4 Dataset**, I will refer to the original paper that introduced this dataset:
> C.-B. Jin, T. D. Do, M. Liu, and H. Kim. *Real-Time Action Detection in Video Surveillance using a Sub-Action Descriptor with Multi-Convolutional Neural Networks*. Journal of Institute of Control, Robotics and Systems, 24(3):298â€“308, Mar. 2018.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described accurately and includes the full citation. This structured approach will help in organizing the information effectively for further processing or review.
