To extract datasets from the research paper titled "TriDoNet: A Triple Domain Model-driven Network for CT Metal Artifact Reduction" by Baoshun Shi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of a novel network for CT metal artifact reduction, but it does not specify any datasets. However, the introduction discusses the challenges of metal artifacts in CT images and hints at the use of datasets for training and evaluation.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methods** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the relevant information is found in the **Experiments and Results** section. Here, the authors state that they selected 1200 clean CT images from the **DeepLesion dataset** and  100 metal masks from another source to synthesize metal artifacts. This is a clear indication of the datasets used in their experiments.

I will now gather the details of the datasets mentioned:

1. **DeepLesion Dataset**: The authors indicate that they used 1200 clean CT images from this dataset. I need to find the full citation for this dataset in the references section.

2. **Metal Masks**: The authors mention using 100 metal masks from a specific source, which is also referenced in the paper. I will need to locate this reference to provide the full citation.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **DeepLesion dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yan, K., Wang, X. S., Lu, L., Zhang, L., Harrison, A. P., Bagheri, M., & Summers, R. M. (2019). Deep lesion graph in the wild: Relationship learning and organization of significant radiology image findings in a diverse large-scale lesion database. In Proceedings of Deep Learning and Convolutional Neural Networks for Medical Imaging and Clinical Informatics (pp. 413–435).

- For the **metal masks**, the authors refer to a previous work, which is cited as:
  > Liao, H. F., Lin, W. A., Zhou, S. K., & Luo, J. (2020). ADN: Artifact disentanglement network for unsupervised metal artifact reduction. IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging, 39(3), 634–643.

With these citations in hand, I can now summarize the datasets extracted from the paper:

1. **Dataset Name**: DeepLesion Dataset
   - **Description**: Contains 1200 clean CT images used for synthesizing metal artifacts.
   - **Citation**: Yan, K., Wang, X. S., Lu, L., Zhang, L., Harrison, A. P., Bagheri, M., & Summers, R. M. (2019). Deep lesion graph in the wild: Relationship learning and organization of significant radiology image findings in a diverse large-scale lesion database. In Proceedings of Deep Learning and Convolutional Neural Networks for Medical Imaging and Clinical Informatics (pp. 413–435).

2. **Dataset Name**: Metal Masks
   - **Description**: 100 metal masks used to synthesize metal artifacts.
   - **Citation**: Liao, H. F., Lin, W. A., Zhou, S. K., & Luo, J. (2020). ADN: Artifact disentanglement network for unsupervised metal artifact reduction. IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging, 39(3), 634–643.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
