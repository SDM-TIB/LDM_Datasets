To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Self Contrastive Learning for Session-based Recommendation" by Zhengxiang Shi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on three benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved. I will note the names of these datasets as they are mentioned.

Next, I will look into **section 5.1 (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention:

1. **Tmall Dataset**: Sourced from the IJCAI-15 competition, it includes anonymized shopping logs from users on the Tmall online shopping platform. The dataset has a training size of 351,268, a test size of 25,898, and an average session length of 6.69.

2. **Nowplaying Dataset**: This dataset describes the music-listening behavior of users, with a training size of 825,304, a test size of 89,824, and an average session length of 7.42.

3. **Diginetica Dataset**: Sourced from the CIKM Cup 2016, it comprises typical transaction data with a training size of 719,470, a test size of 60,858, and an average session length of 5.12.

I will confirm that these datasets are indeed used in the experiments by cross-referencing with the **results section** where the authors discuss their findings based on these datasets.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and will be formatted as follows:

- For the **Tmall Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Jannach, D., Ludewig, M., Lerche, L. (2017). *Session-based item recommendation in e-commerce: on short-term intents, reminders, trends and discounts*. User Modeling and User-Adapted Interaction, 27(3), 351-392.

- For the **Nowplaying Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Brost, B., Mehrotra, R., Jehan, T. (2019). *The music streaming sessions dataset*. In Proceedings of the World Wide Web Conference (WWW), 2594-2600.

- For the **Diginetica Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Rendle, S., Freudenthaler, C., Schmidt-Thieme, L. (2010). *Factorizing personalized markov chains for next-basket recommendation*. In Proceedings of the 19th International Conference on World Wide Web (WWW), 811-820.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described accurately with its respective citation. This structured approach will help in creating a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
