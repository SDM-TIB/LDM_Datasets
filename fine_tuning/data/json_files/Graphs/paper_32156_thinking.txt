To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CLARA: Classifying and Disambiguating User Commands for Reliable Interactive Robotic Agents" by Jeongeun Park et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. In the abstract, the authors mention presenting a dataset for robotic situational awareness, which indicates that a dataset is indeed included in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors discuss their approach and mention the dataset designed to evaluate situational awareness in robotic tasks. They refer to this dataset as the **Situational Awareness for Goal Classification in Robotic Tasks (SaGC)**, which is crucial for understanding the context of their research.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide details about the dataset formulation. They describe how the SaGC dataset consists of high-level goals paired with scene descriptions and uncertainty types, and they mention that it contains 5,006 pairs in total, categorized into certain, ambiguous, and infeasible commands. This section will give me the necessary details about the dataset's structure and purpose.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the SaGC dataset. However, since the dataset is created by the authors themselves, it may not have a separate citation in the references. Instead, I will note that the dataset is introduced in the paper itself.

The relevant details I will extract for the dataset are:

1. **Dataset Name**: Situational Awareness for Goal Classification in Robotic Tasks (SaGC)
2. **Description**: A dataset consisting of high-level user commands, scene descriptions, and uncertainty types to evaluate situational awareness in robotic tasks.
3. **Size**: 5,006 pairs, including 1,749 certain, 1,560 ambiguous, and 1,697 infeasible goals.

Since the dataset is not published separately, I will cite the paper itself as the source of the dataset.

The citation for the dataset will be:
> Jeongeun Park, Seungwon Lim, Joonhyung Lee, Sangbeom Park, Minsuk Chang, Youngjae Yu, and Sungjoon Choi. *CLARA: Classifying and Disambiguating User Commands for Reliable Interactive Robotic Agents*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA), 2023.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format for further processing.
