To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Graph Anomaly Detection via Multi-Scale Contrastive Learning Networks with Augmented View" by Jingcan Duan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on six benchmark datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed present in the paper. I will look for specific names of these datasets.

Next, I will navigate to the **experiments section** where the authors provide details about the datasets used. In this section, they mention six benchmark datasets: **EAT**, **WebKB**, **UAT**, **Cora**, **UAI2010**, and **Citation**. I will take note of these names and any additional details provided about each dataset, such as the number of nodes, edges, attributes, and anomalies.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for each dataset's origin.

The citations I will look for are as follows:

1. **EAT Dataset**: I will check if the paper provides a specific citation or reference for this dataset.
2. **WebKB Dataset**: This dataset is often associated with the work by Craven et al. (1998), which I will confirm.
3. **UAT Dataset**: I will look for the original source or paper that introduced this dataset.
4. **Cora Dataset**: This dataset is commonly referenced in machine learning literature, and I will find its original citation.
5. **UAI2010 Dataset**: I will check for the reference that describes this dataset.
6. **Citation Dataset**: Similar to the others, I will find the original source for this dataset.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, including the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset's details and its corresponding citation.

Finally, I will ensure that the extracted information is accurate and complete, ready for any further processing or analysis that may be required.
