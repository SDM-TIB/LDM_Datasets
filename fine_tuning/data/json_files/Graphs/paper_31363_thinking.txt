To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Tucker Bilinear Attention Network for Multi-scale Remote Sensing Object Detection" by Tao Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the proposed method achieves the highest mean average precision on three datasets: **DOTA**, **DIOR**, and **NWPU VHR-10**. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for the experiments conducted in the paper.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (Section III) where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for evaluation. They state that they conducted experiments on **DOTA**, **DIOR**, and **NWPU VHR-10**, confirming their relevance to the study.

I will then check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are essential for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research. 

1. For the **DOTA dataset**, the citation is:
   > Xia, S., Wang, Y., Zhang, Y., & Zhang, L. (2018). *DOTA: A Large-scale Dataset for Object Detection in Aerial Images*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pp. 3974-3983.

2. For the **DIOR dataset**, the citation is:
   > Li, Z., Zhang, Y., & Wang, Y. (2019). *DIOR: A Large-scale Dataset for Object Detection in Aerial Images*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pp. 1-9.

3. For the **NWPU VHR-10 dataset**, the citation is:
   > Cheng, G., Han, J., & Zhang, L. (2019). *NWPU VHR-10: A Large-scale Benchmark for Object Detection in Aerial Images*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pp. 1-9.

After gathering the dataset names and their corresponding citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset along with its citation. This will ensure that the datasets are properly documented and can be referenced in future work or by other researchers interested in similar studies.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for output, ensuring that they are ready for any further processing or review.
