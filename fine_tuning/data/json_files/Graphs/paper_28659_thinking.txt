To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Molecular Contrastive Learning with Chemical Element Knowledge Graph" by Yin Fang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted extensive experiments on eight molecular datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention that they evaluated their method on eight benchmark datasets from MoleculeNet, which is a strong indication that these datasets will be listed.

I will look for a subsection specifically dedicated to datasets, which is often labeled as "Datasets" or something similar. In this case, the authors provide a list of datasets used for fine-tuning and evaluation, including:

1. **BBBP**: A dataset involving records of whether a compound can penetrate the blood-brain barrier. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Martins, I. F., Teixeira, A. L., Pinheiro, L., & Falcão, A. O. (2012). A Bayesian Approach to in Silico Blood-Brain Barrier Penetration Modeling. *Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling*, 52(6), 1686–1697.

2. **SIDER**: This dataset records marketed drugs along with their adverse drug reactions. The citation is:
   > Kuhn, M., Letunic, I., Jensen, L. J., & Bork, P. (2016). The SIDER database of drugs and side effects. *Nucleic Acids Research*, 44(Database-Issue), D1075–D1079.

3. **ClinTox**: This dataset compares drugs approved through the FDA and those eliminated due to toxicity during clinical trials. The citation is:
   > Gayvert, K. M., Madhukar, N. S., & Elemento, O. (2016). A data-driven approach to predicting successes and failures of clinical trials. *Cell Chemical Biology*, 23(10), 1294–1301.

4. **BACE**: A dataset for recording compounds that could act as inhibitors of human β-secretase 1. The citation is:
   > Subramanian, G., Ramsundar, B., Pande, V., & Denny, R. A. (2016). Computational modeling of β-secretase 1 (BACE-1) inhibitors using ligand-based approaches. *Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling*, 56(10), 1936–1949.

5. **Tox21**: A public database measuring the toxicity of compounds. The citation is:
   > Richard, A. M., Judson, R. S., Houck, K. A., Grulke, C. M., Volarath, P., Thillainadarajah, I., Yang, C., Rathman, J., Martin, M. T., Wambaugh, J. F., et al. (2016). ToxCast chemical landscape: paving the road to 21st century toxicology. *Chemical Research in Toxicology*, 29(8), 1225–1251.

6. **ToxCast**: Contains multiple toxicity labels over thousands of compounds. The citation is:
   > Richard, A. M., Judson, R. S., Houck, K. A., Grulke, C. M., Volarath, P., Thillainadarajah, I., Yang, C., Rathman, J., Martin, M. T., Wambaugh, J. F., et al. (2016). ToxCast chemical landscape: paving the road to 21st century toxicology. *Chemical Research in Toxicology*, 29(8), 1225–1251.

7. **ESOL**: A dataset documenting the solubility of compounds. The citation is:
   > Delaney, J. S. (2004). ESOL: estimating aqueous solubility directly from molecular structure. *Journal of Chemical Information and Computer Sciences*, 44(3), 1000–1005.

8. **FreeSolv**: A dataset containing hydration free energy of small molecules. The citation is:
   > Mobley, D. L., & Guthrie, J. P. (2014). FreeSolv: a database of experimental and calculated hydration free energies, with input files. *Journal of Computer-Aided Molecular Design*, 28(7), 711–720.

After identifying these datasets and their citations, I will compile them into a structured format for easy reference. This ensures that I have accurately captured all relevant information regarding the datasets used in the research paper.
