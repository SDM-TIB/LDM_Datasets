To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Dual Mean-Teacher: An Unbiased Semi-Supervised Framework for Audio-Visual Source Localization" by Yuxin Guo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their method on two datasets: **Flickr-SoundNet** and **VGG-Sound Source**. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for the experiments conducted in the study.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (section 5) where the authors discuss the datasets used for training and evaluation. Here, they explicitly mention that they conducted experiments on **Flickr-SoundNet** and **VGG-Sound**, providing details about the number of samples and the nature of the annotations.

In the **datasets section** (section 5.1), the authors provide a brief overview of the datasets:
1. **Flickr-SoundNet**: This dataset consists of 5,000 bounding-box annotated samples.
2. **VGG-Sound Source**: This dataset contains 5,158 bounding-box annotated samples.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are essential for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations I will extract are:
- For **Flickr-SoundNet**:
  > Honglie Chen, Weidi Xie, Andrea Vedaldi, and Andrew Zisserman. *Vggsound: A large-scale audio-visual dataset*. In International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing (ICASSP), 2020.

- For **VGG-Sound Source**:
  > Honglie Chen, Weidi Xie, Andrea Vedaldi, and Andrew Zisserman. *Vggsound: A large-scale audio-visual dataset*. In International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing (ICASSP), 2020.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations as required. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details and that the citations are accurate and complete.
