To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Predicting the Hosts of Prokaryotic Viruses Using GCN-Based Semi-Supervised Learning" by Jiayu Shang and Yanni Sun, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their full citations.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions the need for knowledge of viral-host relationships and highlights the challenges in computational host prediction. This suggests that datasets related to virus-host interactions are likely to be discussed.

Next, I will examine the **methods** and **results** sections, particularly focusing on any subsections that explicitly mention datasets. In the results section, the authors provide a summary of three datasets used for benchmarking their tool:

1. **VHM Dataset**: This dataset contains 1,426 virus-host interactions, which is a significant dataset for understanding virus-host relationships.
2. **TEST Dataset**: This dataset includes 671 virus-host interactions submitted between 2015 and 2020, providing a more recent benchmark for evaluation.
3. **Single Cell Tagging Dataset**: This dataset consists of 139 virus-host interactions identified through single-cell viral tagging, which is crucial for understanding novel interactions.

I will also look for any specific details about these datasets, such as their sources or how they were constructed, which may be found in the methods or results sections.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. The citations are essential for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **VHM Dataset**:
  > Nathan A Ahlgren, Jie Ren, Yang Young Lu, Jed A Fuhrman, and Fengzhu Sun. *Alignment-free oligonucleotide frequency dissimilarity measure improves prediction of hosts from metagenomically-derived viral sequences*. Nucleic acids research, 45(1):39–53, 2017.

- For the **TEST Dataset**:
  > Congyu Lu, Zheng Zhang, Zena Cai, Zhaozhong Zhu, Ye Qiu, Aiping Wu, Taijiao Jiang, Heping Zheng, and Yousong Peng. *Prokaryotic virus host predictor: a Gaussian model for host prediction of prokaryotic viruses in metagenomics*. BMC biology, 19(1):1–11, 2021.

- For the **Single Cell Tagging Dataset**:
  > Mária Džunková, Soo Jen Low, Joshua N Daly, Li Deng, Christian Rinke, and Philip Hugenholtz. *Defining the human gut host–phage network through single-cell viral tagging*. Nature microbiology, 4(12):2192–2203, 2019.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
