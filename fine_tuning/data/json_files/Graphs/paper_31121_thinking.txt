To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning with Graph Q-Networks for Antenna Tuning" by Maxime Bouton et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned or implied. The abstract discusses the use of a multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm for optimizing mobile network configurations, but it does not specify any datasets at this point.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section V) closely, as this is where datasets are typically described. I will look for any specific mention of datasets used for training or evaluation. In this case, the authors mention using a "proprietary system level simulator" for their experiments, which suggests that they may not be using publicly available datasets but rather a custom simulation environment.

I will also check the **appendix** for any additional details regarding the datasets or simulation parameters. The appendix provides information about the experimental setup, including the number of base stations and users, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets.

Since the paper does not reference any publicly available datasets, I will note that the experiments are based on a proprietary simulator rather than traditional datasets. However, I will still look for any references to similar works or datasets in the **References section** that might provide context or related datasets.

After reviewing the references, I will compile the information I have gathered. If there are no specific datasets mentioned, I will document that the experiments were conducted using a proprietary simulator without publicly available datasets.

Finally, I will ensure to format any findings according to the required citation style, even if it pertains to the simulator or related works rather than traditional datasets. If any relevant citations are found in the references that could be considered as datasets or related works, I will include those citations as well.

In summary, my steps will be:
1. Review the abstract and introduction for dataset mentions.
2. Examine the experiments section for specific datasets.
3. Check the appendix for additional details on datasets or simulations.
4. Review the references for related works or datasets.
5. Document findings and citations appropriately.

Since the paper primarily discusses a proprietary simulation environment, I will conclude that there are no publicly available datasets to cite.
