To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Consistency of Implicit and Explicit Features Matters for Monocular 3D Object Detection" by Qian Ye et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on monocular 3D object detection, but I need to look for specific datasets.

Next, I will examine **section 4.1 (Experiments)**, where the authors discuss the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention the **KITTI Object Detection Dataset** as a key dataset for their evaluation. The authors describe it as a pioneering dataset for visual recognition systems in robotic applications, providing detailed information about the dataset's structure and contents.

In this section, the authors specify that the KITTI dataset includes:
- 7481 training samples and 7518 testing samples.
- Each sample contains two color images, two grayscale images, a point cloud, and object annotations in the form of 3D bounding boxes.

This detailed description confirms that the KITTI dataset is central to their research.

Now, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citation for the KITTI dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:
> Andreas Geiger, Philip Lenz, and Raquel Urtasun. *Are we ready for autonomous driving? The KITTI vision benchmark suite*. 2012 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 3354â€“3361, 2012.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets explicitly, I will focus solely on the KITTI dataset for my extraction.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and full citation, ensuring that all details are accurately represented for future reference or processing.
