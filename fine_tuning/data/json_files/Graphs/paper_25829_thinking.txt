To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Video Semantic Object Segmentation by Self-Adaptation of DCNN" by Seong-Jin Park and Ki-Sang Hong, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the proposed method and mentions the use of a specific dataset for validation, which is a good starting point.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of semantic segmentation in videos and reference existing methods. I will look for any specific datasets mentioned here. 

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**. This section typically contains detailed information about the datasets used for validation and testing. The authors mention validating their method on the **Youtube-Object-Dataset**. I will note this dataset as it is crucial for understanding the context of their experiments.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the **Youtube-Object-Dataset**. The authors reference multiple works related to this dataset, including:

- **Youtube-Object-Dataset**: 
  > Prest, A., Leistner, C., Civera, J., Schmid, C., & Ferrari, V. (2012). Learning object class detectors from weakly annotated video. In *Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2012 IEEE Conference on* (pp. 3282–3289). IEEE.

Additionally, the authors mention modifications made to the dataset in subsequent works, specifically by Jain and Grauman (2014) and Zhang et al. (2015). I will ensure to include these citations as well:

- **Jain and Grauman (2014)**: 
  > Jain, S.D., & Grauman, K. (2014). Supervoxel-consistent foreground propagation in video. In *Computer Vision–ECCV 2014*. Springer, pp. 656–671.

- **Zhang et al. (2015)**: 
  > Zhang, Y., Chen, X., Li, J., Wang, C., & Xia, C. (2015). Semantic object segmentation via detection in weakly labeled video. In *Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition* (pp. 3641–3649).

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and that the full citations are included. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, which is essential for any further analysis or replication of the study.
