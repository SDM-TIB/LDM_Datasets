To extract datasets from the research paper titled "What do we learn? Debunking the Myth of Unsupervised Outlier Detection" by Cosmin I. Bercea et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, and the introduction often outlines the datasets used for experiments.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of outlier detection and mention the use of various datasets. I will look for specific names of datasets or references to them.

Next, I will examine the **methodology and experiments sections** in detail. In these sections, the authors typically describe the datasets used for training and testing their models. I will look for any tables or figures that summarize the datasets, as well as any specific metrics or characteristics that are provided.

From my reading, I identify the following datasets:

1. **MedNIST Dataset**: This dataset is mentioned as containing 58,954 medical images across six classes (ChestCT, BreastMRI, CXR, Hand, HeadCT, AbdomenCT) with a resolution of 64 × 64 pixels. The authors specify the number of images per class and how they split the dataset for training, validation, and testing.

2. **Covid-19 Dataset**: The authors refer to a dataset containing chest X-ray images categorized into normal/healthy, Covid-19, and lung opacity classes. They provide the number of images for each category and detail how they split the dataset for training and testing.

Can AI help in screening viral and COVID-19 pneumonia? IEEE Access, 8, 132665–132676. doi:10.1109/access.2020.3010287.

After identifying these datasets, I will ensure to note any additional details provided in the paper, such as the specific splits used for training and testing, as well as any metrics that are relevant to the datasets.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and that the full citations are included for reference. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research.
