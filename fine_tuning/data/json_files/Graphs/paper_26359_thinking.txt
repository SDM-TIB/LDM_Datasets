To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Graph Neural Networks for Decentralized Multi-Robot Path Planning" by Qingbiao Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract discusses the evaluation of the proposed method in simulations, which may imply the use of specific datasets, but does not explicitly name any.

Next, I will examine the **methodology and experiments sections** (particularly sections 5 and 6) to look for any specific datasets used for training or testing the models. In section 5.6 (Expert Data Generation), the authors mention generating a dataset comprising 30,000 cases for a grid world with static obstacles. This indicates that there is a dataset involved, but I need to gather more details.

In section 5.6, the authors describe how they generate problem instances consisting of pairs of start and goal positions for all robots, and they mention using an expert algorithm (Conflict-Based Search) to compute optimal trajectories. However, they do not provide a specific name for the dataset itself.

I will also check the **references section** to see if any datasets are cited or if there are any papers that describe datasets relevant to their work. The references include various works related to multi-robot path planning and graph neural networks, but they do not explicitly cite a dataset.

Since the paper does not provide a specific dataset name or citation, I will summarize the dataset information as follows:

1. **Dataset Name**: Multi-Robot Path Planning Dataset
   - **Description**: A dataset comprising 30,000 cases generated for a grid world with static obstacles, used for training and testing the proposed model. Each case consists of pairs of start and goal positions for multiple robots.
   - **Citation**: Not explicitly provided in the paper.

2. **Expert Algorithm**: Conflict-Based Search (CBS)
   - **Description**: An expert algorithm used to compute optimal trajectories for the generated problem instances.
   - **Citation**: Guni Sharon, Roni Stern, Ariel Felner, and Nathan R Sturtevant. *Conflict-based search for optimal multi-agent pathfinding*. Artificial Intelligence, 219 (2015), 40â€“66.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format, ensuring that I include the necessary details and citations for any datasets mentioned or implied in the paper. This will help in documenting the datasets used in the research effectively.
