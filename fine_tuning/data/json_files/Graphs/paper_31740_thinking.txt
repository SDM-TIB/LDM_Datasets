To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ContraNeRF: 3D-Aware Generative Model via Contrastive Learning with Unsupervised Implicit Pose Embedding" by Mijeong Kim et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the proposed method is validated on multiple datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 6 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they list four datasets:

1. **LSUN Bedroom**: This dataset is referenced as a challenging dataset for 3D-aware GANs, containing a large number of images (3,033,042). The authors note that the canonical pose is hard to define for this dataset.

2. **LSUN Church**: Similar to the Bedroom dataset, this dataset consists of 126,227 images and presents challenges in defining canonical poses.

3. **AFHQ (Animal Faces-HQ)**: This dataset includes images of animal faces across three categories (cats, dogs, and wildlife), with a total of 14,630 images.

4. **CUB (Caltech-UCSD Birds-200-2011)**: This dataset contains 11,788 images of birds and is noted for having large object pose variations.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **LSUN Bedroom** and **LSUN Church**, the citation is:
  > Fisher Yu, Ari Seff, Yinda Zhang, Shuran Song, Thomas Funkhouser, and Jianxiong Xiao. *LSUN: Construction of a large-scale image dataset using deep learning with humans in the loop*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1506.03365, 2015.

- For **AFHQ**, the citation is:
  > Yunjey Choi, Youngjung Uh, Jaejun Yoo, and Jung-Woo Ha. *StarGAN v2: Diverse image synthesis for multiple domains*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2020.

- For **CUB**, the citation is:
  > Catherine Wah, Steve Branson, Peter Welinder, Pietro Perona, and Serge Belongie. *The Caltech-UCSD Birds-200-2011 dataset*. 2011.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. Each dataset will be described with its name, a brief description, and the full citation.
