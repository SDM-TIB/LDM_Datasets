To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CLeaRForecast: Contrastive Learning of High-Purity Representations for Time Series Forecasting" by Jiaxin Gao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the proposed method is evaluated on multiple real-world datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they explicitly list five datasets:

1. **Electricity Dataset**: This dataset comprises hourly electricity consumption data from 321 clients spanning the years 2012 to 2014, with 26,304 timesteps for each variable.

2. **Weather Dataset**: This dataset includes local climatological data for nearly 1,600 areas in the United States, collected over four years at 10-minute intervals, capturing 11 weather variables.

3. **ETT Dataset**: This dataset consists of two sets of hourly-level data (ETTh1 and ETTh2) and one set of 15-minute-level data (ETTm1), containing oil and load features of electricity transformers recorded from July 2016 to July 2018.

The paper also mentions that the datasets are used for both univariate and multivariate forecasting tasks, which is important for understanding their application.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For the **Electricity Dataset**, the citation is:
  > UCI. 2015. Electricity. Available at: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/ElectricityLoadDiagrams20112014.

- For the **Weather Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Wetterstation. 2020. Weather. Available at: https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/data/local-climatological-data/.

- For the **ETT Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Zhou, H.; Zhang, S.; Peng, J.; Zhang, S.; Li, J.; Xiong, H.; and Zhang, W. 2021. Informer: Beyond Efficient Transformer for Long Sequence Time-Series Forecasting. In AAAI.

With this information, I can now summarize the datasets and their citations clearly.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that is ready for review or further processing.
