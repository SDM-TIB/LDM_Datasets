To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Backdoor Attack with Mode Mixture Latent Modification" by Hongwei Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant details, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method on four popular benchmark datasets: **MNIST, CIFAR-10, GTSRB, and TinyImageNet**. This is a clear indication that these datasets are central to the research.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In the paper, there is a **Table 1** that provides detailed information about the datasets used, including their characteristics such as the number of labels, input size, number of training images, and number of test images. This table confirms the datasets mentioned in the abstract.

The datasets listed in Table 1 are:

1. **MNIST**: A dataset of handwritten digits with 10 labels, an input size of 28 × 28 pixels, 60,000 training images, and 10,000 test images.
2. **CIFAR-10**: A dataset containing natural images with 10 labels, an input size of 32 × 32 pixels, 50,000 training images, and 10,000 test images.
3. **GTSRB**: The German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark, which has 43 labels, an input size of 64 × 64 pixels, 39,209 training images, and 12,630 test images.
4. **TinyImageNet**: A dataset of natural images with 200 labels, an input size of 64 × 64 pixels, 500 training images per class, and 50 test images per class.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- **MNIST**: 
  > Yann LeCun. The MNIST database of handwritten digits. http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/, 1998.

- **CIFAR-10**: 
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton, et al. Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images. 2009.

- **GTSRB**: 
  > Johannes Stallkamp, Marc Schlipsing, Jan Salmen, and Christian Igel. The German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark: A multi-class classification competition. In The 2011 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks, pages 1453–1460. IEEE, 2011.

- **TinyImageNet**: 
  > Ya Le and Xuan Yang. Tiny ImageNet visual recognition challenge. CS 231N, 7(7):3, 2015.

With this information, I can now summarize the datasets and their citations clearly. 

In conclusion, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective details and citations, ensuring that I have accurately captured all necessary information for further processing or review.
