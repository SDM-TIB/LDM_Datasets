To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Contrastive Self-Supervised Learning Based Approach for Patient Similarity: A Case Study on Atrial Fibrillation Detection from PPG Signal" by Subangkar Karmaker Shanto et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions a dataset of over 170 individuals, which indicates that a dataset is indeed used.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors describe the dataset used for their case study. In **section 3.2 (Dataset)**, they specify that they used the **Stanford Wearable Photoplethysmography Dataset** for training their model. This dataset is described as containing over 500K segments collected from 175 individuals, with specific details about the subjects and the nature of the data.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the Stanford Wearable Photoplethysmography Dataset. The authors reference the dataset as being made public by another work, specifically citing:

> [50] Jessica Torres-Soto and Euan A Ashley. *Multi-task deep learning for cardiac rhythm detection in wearable devices*. NPJ digital medicine, 3(1):1â€“8, 2020.

This citation is crucial as it provides the necessary details for anyone looking to access the dataset.

Now, I will compile the information about the dataset into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation as required. 

In summary, the key steps I took were:
1. Read through the relevant sections of the paper to identify datasets.
2. Locate the specific dataset mentioned in the experiments section.
3. Retrieve the full citation from the references section to ensure proper attribution.

With this information, I can now create a detailed entry for the dataset used in the research.
