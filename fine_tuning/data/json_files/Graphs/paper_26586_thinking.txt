To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Joint Item Recommendation and Attribute Inference: An Adaptive Graph Convolutional Network Approach" by Le Wu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on three real-world datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed present. I will look for specific names and descriptions of these datasets.

Next, I will navigate to **section 5.1.1 (Datasets Description)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention three datasets:

1. **Amazon-Video Games**: This dataset contains users' implicit feedback and product attributes, specifically focusing on three attributes: price, platform, and theme. The authors note that they selected attributes that appear in the top 25% and processed the data accordingly.

2. **Movielens-1M**: This is a classical recommendation dataset that includes user attributes. The authors mention that they filtered the dataset to increase sparsity by only selecting ratings equal to 5, which indicates users' liked movies.

3. **Movielens-20M**: This dataset contains 20 million rating records of movies, along with item attributes. The authors treat items rated by users as positive feedback and mention that each item belongs to several genres.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and will provide additional context about the datasets.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **Amazon-Video Games**, the citation is:
  > Julian McAuley, Christopher Targett, Qinfeng Shi, and Anton Van Den Hengel. *Image-based recommendations on styles and substitutes*. In Proceedings of the 38th International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval, pages 43–52, 2015.

- For **Movielens-1M**, the citation is:
  > F. Maxwell Harper and Joseph A. Konstan. *The movielens datasets: History and context*. ACM Transactions on Interactive Intelligent Systems, 5(4):1–19, 2015.

- For **Movielens-20M**, the citation is:
  > F. Maxwell Harper and Joseph A. Konstan. *The movielens datasets: History and context*. ACM Transactions on Interactive Intelligent Systems, 5(4):1–19, 2015.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
