To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fairness-aware Multi-view Clustering" by Lecheng Zheng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on several datasets, which indicates that there are datasets to extract.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they explicitly mention three datasets with fairness constraints and two datasets without fairness constraints:

1. **Credit Card Dataset**: This dataset is used for evaluating the proposed method, and it includes sensitive features such as gender. The authors mention that it consists of 30,000 samples with 24 attributes.

2. **Bank Marketing Dataset**: This dataset is associated with direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution. It contains 1,000 instances and 20 attributes, with marital status as a sensitive feature.

3. **Zafar Dataset**: A widely-used synthetic dataset where one binary value is generated as the sensitive feature.

4. **Noisy MNIST Dataset**: This dataset consists of 70,000 images of handwritten digits, which have been perturbed with noise for the experiments.

5. **X-ray Microbeam (XRMB) Dataset**: This dataset consists of acoustic and articulatory data, with 40 binary labels.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets:

- For the **Credit Card Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yeh, I.-C., & Lien, C.-H. (2009). The comparisons of data mining techniques for the predictive accuracy of probability of default of credit card clients. *Expert Systems with Applications*, 36(2), 2473-2480.

- For the **Bank Marketing Dataset**, the citation is:

- For the **Zafar Dataset**, the citation is:

- For the **Noisy MNIST Dataset**, the citation is:
  > LeCun, Y., & Cortes, C. (1998). MNIST handwritten digit database. *http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/*.

- For the **X-ray Microbeam (XRMB) Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Westbury, J. (1994). X-ray microbeam speech production database userâ€™s handbook. *Waisman Center, University of Wisconsin*.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will facilitate further research and validation of the findings presented in the paper.
