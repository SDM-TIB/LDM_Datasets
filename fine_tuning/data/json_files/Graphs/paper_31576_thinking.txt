To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Detecting and Grounding Multi-Modal Media Manipulation" by Rui Shao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract introduces the concept of a new dataset specifically for the DGM4 problem, which indicates that a dataset is indeed present.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Multi-Modal Media Manipulation Dataset)**, where the authors describe the dataset in detail. Here, they mention the construction of the **DGM4 dataset**, which is the primary dataset for their experiments. I will note the key characteristics of this dataset, including its size, the types of manipulations included, and the annotations provided.

In this section, the authors explain that the DGM4 dataset consists of 230,000 news samples, including 77,426 pristine image-text pairs and 152,574 manipulated pairs. They detail the types of manipulations (face swap, face attribute, text swap, and text attribute) and the rich annotations for detection and grounding tasks.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the source dataset used to construct the DGM4 dataset. The authors mention that they based their dataset on the **VisualNews dataset**, which collects image-text pairs from real-world news sources. I will look for the citation for this dataset as well.

The citation for the **VisualNews dataset** is:
> Fuxiao Liu, Yinghan Wang, Tianlu Wang, and Vicente Ordonez. *Visual news: Benchmark and challenges in news image captioning*. In EMNLP, 2021.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citations for both datasets:

1. **DGM4 Dataset**: A large-scale dataset constructed for the DGM4 problem, containing 230,000 samples with rich annotations for manipulation detection and grounding.
2. **VisualNews Dataset**: The source dataset used to create the DGM4 dataset, which provides the foundational image-text pairs.

Finally, I will prepare to present this information in the required format, ensuring that all citations are complete and accurate for future reference.
