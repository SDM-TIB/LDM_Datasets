To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Triple-Encoders: Representations That Fire Together, Wire Together" by Justus-Jonas Erker et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. In the abstract, the authors mention that their experiments are conducted on two datasets: **DailyDialog** and **MDC**. This indicates that these datasets are likely important for the research and should be included.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **Datasets** section or any mention of datasets in the **experiments** section. In the **experiments** section, the authors explicitly state that they evaluate their models on **DailyDialog** (Li et al., 2017) and **MDC** (Li et al., 2018). This confirms that these are the datasets used for their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References** section to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For **DailyDialog**, the citation is:
   > Li, Y., Su, H., Shen, X., Li, W., & Cao, Z. (2017). DailyDialog: A manually labelled multi-turn dialogue dataset. In Proceedings of the Eighth International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing (Volume 1: Long Papers), pages 986â€“995, Taipei, Taiwan. Asian Federation of Natural Language Processing.

2. For **MDC**, the citation is:
   > Li, X., Wang, Y., Sun, S., Panda, S., Liu, J., & Gao, J. (2018). Microsoft dialogue challenge: Building end-to-end task-completion dialogue systems. arXiv:1807.11125.

Having gathered the necessary information, I will now compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
