To extract datasets from the research paper titled "To Supervise or Not to Supervise: Understanding and Addressing the Key Challenges of 3D Transfer Learning" by Souhail Hadgi et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and datasets section** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a general overview, but the **introduction** and **section 3 (Datasets and Architectures)** are likely to contain specific details about the datasets used in the research.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of 3D transfer learning and mention the need for large-scale labeled datasets. However, I need to look for specific dataset names.

Moving to **section 3 (Datasets and Architectures)**, the authors explicitly list the datasets used in their experiments. They mention:

1. **ShapeNet**: A dataset containing 51,300 annotated 3D synthetic shapes across 55 categories, used for pre-training.
2. **ModelNet40**: A synthetic object-level dataset with 12,311 shapes and 40 object classes, used for shape classification tasks.
3. **ScanObjectNN**: A real object-level dataset with 15,000 scanned 3D shapes and 15 object classes, used for shape classification tasks.
4. **S3DIS**: A real scene-level dataset consisting of 3D scans of large-scale indoor areas with 13 semantic categories, used for semantic segmentation tasks.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for the datasets used in the research.

- For **ShapeNet**, the citation is:
  > Chang, A.X., Funkhouser, T., Guibas, L., Hanrahan, P., Huang, Q., Li, Z., Savarese, S., Savva, M., Song, S., Su, H., Xiao, J., Yi, L., Yu, F. (2015). *ShapeNet: An information-rich 3D model repository*. Tech. rep.

- For **ModelNet40**, the citation is:
  > Wu, Z., Song, S., Khosla, A., Yu, F., Zhang, L., Tang, X., Xiao, J. (2015). *3D ShapeNets: A deep representation for volumetric shapes*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 1912–1920.

- For **ScanObjectNN**, the citation is:
  > Uy, M.A., Pham, Q.H., Hua, B.S., Nguyen, T., Yeung, S.K. (2019). *Revisiting point cloud classification: A new benchmark dataset and classification model on real-world data*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision, pp. 1588–1597.

- For **S3DIS**, the citation is:
  > Armeni, I., Sener, O., Zamir, A.R., Jiang, H., Brilakis, I., Fischer, M., Savarese, S. (2016). *3D semantic parsing of large-scale indoor spaces*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 1534–1543.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their full citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or analysis. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets referenced in the paper along with their proper citations.
