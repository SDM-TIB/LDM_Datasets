To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Explanation Guided Contrastive Learning for Sequential Recommendation" by Zhiwei Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments on **four real-world benchmark datasets**. This indicates that datasets are indeed involved, and I need to find their names and details.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In the paper, there is a **Table 2** that summarizes the statistics of the datasets used, which includes:

1. **Beauty Dataset**: 
   - Users: 22,363
   - Items: 12,101
   - User-item Interactions: 198,502
   - Avg Sequence Length: 8.9
   - Sparsity: 99.93%

2. **Clothing Dataset**: 
   - Users: 39,387
   - Items: 23,033
   - User-item Interactions: 278,677
   - Avg Sequence Length: 7.1
   - Sparsity: 99.97%

3. **Sports Dataset**: 
   - Users: 35,598
   - Items: 18,357
   - User-item Interactions: 296,337
   - Avg Sequence Length: 8.3
   - Sparsity: 99.95%

4. **ML-1M Dataset**: 
   - Users: 6,041
   - Items: 3,417
   - User-item Interactions: 999,611
   - Avg Sequence Length: 165.5
   - Sparsity: 95.16%

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. The paper does not provide specific citations for the datasets directly, but I can infer that the **ML-1M dataset** is a well-known dataset in the recommendation systems community. The citation for the ML-1M dataset is:

- For **ML-1M Dataset**:
  > F. Maxwell Harper and Joseph A. Konstan. *The Movielens Datasets: History and Context*. ACM Transactions on Interactive Intelligent Systems (TIIS), 5(4):1-19, 2015. 

The other datasets (Beauty, Clothing, and Sports) are from Amazon and may not have formal citations in the same way as ML-1M, but they are commonly referenced in the literature.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citation for the ML-1M dataset and noting the other datasets as commonly used benchmarks in the field.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring clarity and completeness for future reference or processing.
