To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Spatial-Temporal Dynamic Graph Attention Networks for Ride-hailing Demand Prediction" by Weiguo Pian et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on a "real-world ride-hailing demand dataset," which suggests that a specific dataset is being used.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any relevant mentions in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the dataset is described in detail in the **Implementation Details** and **Experiments** sections. Here, the authors specify that they used a ride-hailing dataset from Didi Chuxing, which is crucial for my extraction.

The dataset is described as follows:
- **Didi Chuxing Dataset**: This dataset contains ride-hailing orders from Haikou, China, spanning from May 1, 2017, to October 31, 2017. It includes a total of 12,185,427 orders, divided into 4,416 time intervals, with 121 regions, each approximately 1 km x 1 km in size.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The dataset is sourced from Didi Chuxing's GAIA Initiative, but it does not have a formal citation like a typical academic paper. However, I can still note the source as follows:

- **Didi Chuxing Dataset**: Data source: Didi Chuxing GAIA Initiative.

With this information, I will summarize the dataset details and ensure that I include the full citation for the dataset as required.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry in a structured format, ensuring that all necessary details are included for clarity and completeness.
