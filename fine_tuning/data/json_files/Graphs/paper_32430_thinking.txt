To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Predicting Drug-Drug Interactions Using Knowledge Graphs" by Lizzy Farrugia et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors used a dataset based on Drug-Drug Interactions (DDIs) found in DrugBank version 5.1.8, which suggests that this is a key dataset for their research.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any additional context or datasets. The authors mention the importance of integrating data from various drug-related repositories, specifically citing DrugBank and SIDER as sources for their Knowledge Graph (KG). This indicates that both DrugBank and SIDER are relevant datasets.

In the **methodology section**, I will look for detailed descriptions of how the datasets were used. The authors state that they accumulated 2,477,864 unique DDIs from multiple sources, including DrugBank, KEGG, and SIDER. This confirms that these datasets are integral to their research.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

1. **DrugBank**: The citation for DrugBank is:
   > Wishart, D. S., Knox, C., Guo, A. C., Cheng, D., Shrivastava, S., Tzur, D., Gautam, B., & Hassanali, M. (2007). Drugbank: a knowledgebase for drugs, drug actions and drug targets. *Nucleic acids research*, 36(suppl 1), D901-D906.

2. **SIDER**: The citation for SIDER is:
   > Kuhn, M., Letunic, I., Jensen, L. J., & Bork, P. (2015). The sider database of drugs and side effects. *Nucleic acids research*, 44(D1), D1075-D1079.

3. **KEGG**: The citation for KEGG is:
   > Kanehisa, M., & Goto, S. (2000). Kegg: kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes. *Nucleic acids research*, 28(1), 27-30.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
