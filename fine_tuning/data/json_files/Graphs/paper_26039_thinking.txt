To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-Label Image Recognition with Graph Convolutional Networks" by Zhao-Min Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors conducted experiments on **two multi-label image recognition datasets**, which indicates that specific datasets will be discussed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically detail the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they explicitly mention the datasets:

1. **MS-COCO Dataset**: This dataset is described as a widely used benchmark for multi-label image recognition, containing 82,081 images for training and 40,504 images for validation, categorized into 80 classes.

2. **PASCAL VOC 2007 Dataset**: This dataset is noted for containing 9,963 images across 20 object categories, which are divided into training, validation, and test sets.

To confirm the details about these datasets, I will also check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **MS-COCO**, the citation is:
  > Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, Serge Belongie, James Hays, Pietro Perona, Deva Ramanan, Piotr Dollár, and C Lawrence Zitnick. *Microsoft COCO: Common objects in context*. In Proceedings of the European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), pages 740–755, 2014.

- For **PASCAL VOC 2007**, the citation is:
  > Mark Everingham, Luc Van Gool, Christopher KI Williams, John Winn, and Andrew Zisserman. *The pascal visual object classes (VOC) challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision (IJCV), 88(2):303–338, 2010.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations.
