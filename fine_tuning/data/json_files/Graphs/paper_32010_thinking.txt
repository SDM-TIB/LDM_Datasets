To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Robust Representation Learning with Reliable Pseudo-labels Generation via Self-Adaptive Optimal Transport for Short Text Clustering" by Xiaolin Zheng et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract states that the authors conducted empirical studies on **eight short text clustering datasets**, which indicates that multiple datasets are involved.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, the authors list the datasets used for their experiments:

1. **AgNews**: A dataset consisting of 8,000 news titles in 4 topic categories. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Rakib, M. H., Zeh, N., Jankowska, M., & Milios, E. (2020). Enhancement of short text clustering by iterative classification. In International Conference on Applications of Natural Language to Information Systems (pp. 105-117). Springer.

2. **StackOverflow**: This dataset contains 20,000 question titles associated with 20 different tags. The citation is:
   > Xu, J., Xu, B., Wang, S., Zheng, S., Tian, G., Zhao, J., & Xu, B. (2017). Self-taught convolutional neural networks for short text clustering. Neural Networks, 88, 22-31.

3. **Biomedical**: Composed of 20,000 paper titles from 20 different topics. The citation is:
   > Xu, J., Xu, B., Wang, S., Zheng, S., Tian, G., Zhao, J., & Xu, B. (2017). Self-taught convolutional neural networks for short text clustering. Neural Networks, 88, 22-31.

4. **SearchSnippets**: Contains 12,340 snippets from 8 different classes. The citation is:
   > Phan, X. H., Nguyen, L. M., & Horiguchi, S. (2008). Learning to classify short and sparse text & web with hidden topics from large-scale data collections. In Proceedings of the 17th international conference on World Wide Web (pp. 91-100).

5. **GoogleNews-TS**: This dataset consists of the titles and snippets of 11,109 news articles about 152 events. The citation is:
   > Yin, J., & Wang, J. (2016). A model-based approach for text clustering with outlier detection. In 2016 IEEE 32nd International Conference on Data Engineering (ICDE) (pp. 625-636). IEEE.

6. **GoogleNews-T**: A subset of GoogleNews-TS that only contains titles. The citation is the same as for GoogleNews-TS.

7. **GoogleNews-S**: Another subset of GoogleNews-TS that only has snippets. The citation is the same as for GoogleNews-TS.

8. **Tweet**: This dataset consists of 2,472 tweets related to 89 queries. The citation is:
   > Yin, J., & Wang, J. (2016). A model-based approach for text clustering with outlier detection. In 2016 IEEE 32nd International Conference on Data Engineering (ICDE) (pp. 625-636). IEEE.

After identifying the datasets and their citations, I will ensure to compile this information clearly, emphasizing the importance of providing full citations for each dataset used in the research.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for further processing or review, ensuring that all relevant details are included.
