To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Two-stage Generative Question Answering on Temporal Knowledge Graph Using Large Language Models" by Yifu Gao et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and it may mention datasets used for evaluation or experimentation. 

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically **section 5.1 (Datasets, Metrics and Baselines)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used in their experiments. Here, I find that the authors mention the **CronQuestions dataset**. They provide details about its composition, including the number of entities, relations, timestamps, and facts, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's scope.

In this section, the authors state that the **CronQuestions dataset** is based on the **Wikidata TKG** and includes 125k entities, 203 relations, 1.7k timestamps, and 328k facts. They also mention that it contains 410K unique question-answer pairs, categorized into simple and complex reasoning types.

Now, I will look for the full citation of the **CronQuestions dataset** in the **References section**. The citation provided is:
> Apoorv Saxena, Soumen Chakrabarti, and Partha P. Talukdar. *Question answering over temporal knowledge graphs*. In ACL-IJCNLP, pages 6663–6676, 2021.

Additionally, I will also note the citation for the **Wikidata TKG**, which is referenced in the context of the dataset:
> Timothée Lacroix, Guillaume Obozinski, and Nicolas Usunier. *Tensor decompositions for temporal knowledge base completion*. In ICLR, 2020.

With these citations, I can now summarize the datasets extracted from the paper:

1. **CronQuestions Dataset**: A temporal QA dataset based on the Wikidata TKG, comprising 125k entities, 203 relations, 1.7k timestamps, and 328k facts. It contains 410K unique question-answer pairs, categorized into simple reasoning and complex reasoning types.
   - Citation: Apoorv Saxena, Soumen Chakrabarti, and Partha P. Talukdar. *Question answering over temporal knowledge graphs*. In ACL-IJCNLP, pages 6663–6676, 2021.

2. **Wikidata TKG**: A knowledge graph that serves as the basis for the CronQuestions dataset.
   - Citation: Timothée Lacroix, Guillaume Obozinski, and Nicolas Usunier. *Tensor decompositions for temporal knowledge base completion*. In ICLR, 2020.

Finally, I will compile these dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
