To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Real-Time Machine Learning Enabled Low-Cost Magnetometer System" by Talha Siddique and Md. Shaad Mahmud, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, results, and conclusion sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on a low-cost magnetometer system, but I need to look for specific datasets used in the experiments.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of estimating Geomagnetically Induced Currents (GICs) and mention the use of ground-based magnetometers. They reference the **SuperMAG** dataset, which is a collection of data from over 300 ground-based magnetometers, indicating that this dataset is relevant to their work.

Next, I will examine the **methodology section**, where the authors describe their experimental setup. They mention using data from the **SWUG magnetometer**, which is a collaboration between the University of New Hampshire and local high schools to collect geomagnetic data. This dataset is crucial for their analysis and model training.

In the **results section**, the authors present findings based on the data collected from the RM3100 sensor and the SWUG magnetometer. They also discuss the performance of their machine learning models in relation to the baseline-corrected data from the SWUG magnetometer, confirming its importance in their experiments.

Now, I will look at the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. **SuperMAG Dataset**: The citation for the SuperMAG data processing technique is:
   > J. W. Gjerloev, “The SuperMAG data processing technique,” Journal of Geophysical Research (Space Physics), vol. 117, no. A9, p. A09213, Sep. 2012.

2. **SWUG Magnetometer Dataset**: The citation for the SWUG initiative is:
   > C. W. Smith et al., “The Space Weather Underground: Design and Early Results from A Student-Built Array of Ground-Based Fluxgate Magnetometers in Northern New England,” in AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts, vol. 2020, Dec. 2020, pp. SM011–12.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes the full citation as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
