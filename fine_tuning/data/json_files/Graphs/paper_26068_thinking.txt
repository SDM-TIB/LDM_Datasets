To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Understanding Urban Dynamics via Context-aware Tensor Factorization with Neighboring Regularization" by Jingyuan Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors applied their model to a real-life dataset containing taxi GPS trajectories and POI records of Beijing. This indicates that there are specific datasets used in their experiments.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In the introduction, the authors discuss the importance of understanding urban dynamics and mention the use of mobile crowd sensing technologies, which suggests that they are working with real-world data.

Upon reaching the **experiments section**, I will find detailed descriptions of the datasets used. The authors specify three types of datasets:

1. **Taxi Trajectory Data**: This dataset contains GPS trajectories of over 20,000 taxis in Beijing, collected from November 2008 to November 2015. The authors mention that they extracted more than 6 million trips from this data.

2. **POI Data**: This dataset includes over 400,000 POI records in Beijing for the years 2008 and 2015. This data is crucial for understanding urban contexts.

3. **Traffic Analysis Zone (TAZ) Data**: Provided by the Beijing Municipal Commission of Transportation, this dataset segments the Beijing area into 651 zones.

Next, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are important for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, facilitating further exploration and validation of the findings presented in the paper.
