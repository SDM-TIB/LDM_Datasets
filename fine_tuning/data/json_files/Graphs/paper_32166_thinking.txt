To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Pairing Information Augmentation Approach for Aspect Sentiment Triplet Extraction" by Fan Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their method on **four ASTE datasets**: 14lap, 14res, 15res, and 16res. This is a clear indication that I need to gather more details about these datasets.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the datasets used. They mention that these datasets are part of the **ASTE-Data-V2** collection released by Xu et al. and originally come from SemEval Challenges. The datasets are:

1. **14lap**: A dataset focused on laptops, containing reviews and sentiment annotations.
2. **14res**: A dataset focused on restaurants, containing reviews and sentiment annotations.
3. **15res**: Another restaurant-focused dataset, also containing reviews and sentiment annotations.
4. **16res**: Yet another restaurant dataset, with similar characteristics.

In the **References section**, I will look for the full citations of the original sources of these datasets. The authors reference the SemEval Challenges, which will guide me to the appropriate citations.

The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **14lap**, the citation is:
  > Kirange, D., Deshmukh, R.R., Kirange, M. *Aspect based sentiment analysis semeval-2014 task 4*. Asian J. Comput. Sci. & Inf. Technol 4(8), 72–75, 2014.

- For **14res**, **15res**, and **16res**, the citations are:
  > Pontiki, M., Galanis, D., Papageorgiou, H., Androutsopoulos, I., Manandhar, S., Al-Smadi, M., Al-Ayyoub, M., Zhao, Y., Qin, B., De Clercq, O., et al. *SemEval-2016 task 5: Aspect based sentiment analysis*. In: International workshop on semantic evaluation, pp. 19–30, 2016.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
