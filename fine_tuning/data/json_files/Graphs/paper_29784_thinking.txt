To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The Right Tool for the Job: Open-Source Auditing Tools in Machine Learning" by Cherie M. Poland, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections that discuss tools and techniques** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a general overview, but I will focus on the sections that are likely to contain specific dataset references.

In the **introduction**, the author discusses the importance of fairness in machine learning and mentions various auditing tools. However, it does not explicitly mention any datasets at this point.

Next, I will examine the **sections on tools and techniques**. In section IV, the author lists several open-source auditing tools, such as AI Fairness 360, LIME, and others. While these tools are important, I need to check if any specific datasets are referenced in relation to these tools.

As I continue through the paper, I will look for any **examples or case studies** that might mention datasets used for testing or demonstrating the tools. If the author provides any specific datasets, I will note their names and descriptions.

After identifying any datasets, I will then refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access the datasets.

If the paper does not explicitly mention datasets, I will note that as well, indicating that while various tools are discussed, no specific datasets were cited.

Once I have gathered all the relevant information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets referenced in the paper, if any.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for easy review and processing.
