To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-Relational Graph Neural Network for Out-of-Domain Link Prediction" by Asma Sattar et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the introduction of five benchmarks based on two retail domains, which indicates that datasets are likely discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section**. In this paper, the relevant information is found in **section V (Benchmarks and Experimental Analysis)**. Here, the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments, which include:

1. **Seasonal Transaction (ST) Datasets (ST1, ST2, ST3)**: These datasets are derived from an internal dataset provided by H&M, consisting of online transactions from multiple markets and different seasons. They are represented as multi-relational graphs with various types of products and edges.

2. **Customer Segmentation Datasets (CS1, CS2)**: These datasets are publicly available and consist of online transactions from customers in the UK. They also represent multi-relational graphs with different types of products and edges.

In section V, the authors provide statistical information about these datasets, including the number of nodes and edges, which further confirms their relevance.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the **References section**. However, since the datasets are derived from internal and publicly available sources, I will need to cite them appropriately:

- For **Seasonal Transaction Datasets (ST1, ST2, ST3)**, the citation is:
  > H&M Group. *Seasonal Transaction Dataset*. Internal dataset, 2023.

- For **Customer Segmentation Datasets (CS1, CS2)**, the citation is:
  > Fabiendaniel. *Customer Segmentation Dataset*. Available at: https://www.kaggle.com/fabiendaniel/customer-segmentation/data, accessed 2023.

After collecting this information, I will summarize the datasets, including their types, characteristics, and citations, ensuring that I adhere to the required format for clarity and completeness. This will prepare me for the final step of structuring the dataset information for further use or analysis.
