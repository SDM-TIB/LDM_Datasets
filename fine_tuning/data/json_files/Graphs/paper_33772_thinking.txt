To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fusion of Diffusion Weighted MRI and Clinical Data for Predicting Functional Outcome after Acute Ischemic Stroke with Deep Contrastive Learning" by Chia-Ling Tsai et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and materials and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's aim and mentions that the model was trained and evaluated with a dataset of **3297 patients**. This indicates that a dataset is indeed present.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Materials and Methods)**, specifically the subsection **2.1 (Dataset)**, where the authors describe the dataset in detail. Here, they mention that the dataset consists of **ADC and DWI images** taken from **3297 patients** who were hospitalized for acute ischemic stroke (AIS) between October 2007 and September 2021. They also specify that the dataset includes **62 clinical variables**, such as age, onset-to-admission delay, comorbidities, and the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS).

The authors clarify that only the earliest hospitalization for each patient is considered, and they provide additional details about the data collection process, including the exclusion of images with substantial artifacts. This section confirms the dataset's relevance and the specific patient population involved.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. However, since the dataset is derived from a specific hospital's patient records and does not appear to be a publicly available dataset, I will note that the dataset is not formally cited in the references. Instead, I will summarize the dataset's characteristics based on the information provided in the paper.

The dataset can be described as follows:
- **Dataset Name**: Ditmanson Medical Foundation Chia-Yi Christian Hospital AIS Dataset
- **Description**: A dataset consisting of ADC and DWI images from 3297 patients hospitalized for acute ischemic stroke, along with 62 clinical variables.
- **Time Period**: Data collected from October 2007 to September 2021.
- **Patient Characteristics**: Includes various clinical attributes such as age, NIHSS, and comorbidities.

Since the dataset does not have a formal citation, I will note that it is based on internal hospital records and is not publicly available.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format for clarity and future reference.
