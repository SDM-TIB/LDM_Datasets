To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Sound Localization Better from Semantically Similar Samples" by Arda Senocak et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors demonstrate their method on the **VGG-SS** and **SoundNet-Flickr** test sets, which suggests that these are the datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 3) where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for training and testing. In this section, they state that they train their method on **VGGSound** and **SoundNet-Flickr**, and test it on **VGG-SS** and **SoundNet-Flickr-Test**. This confirms that these datasets are integral to their research.

Now, I will gather detailed descriptions of each dataset from the text:

1. **VGGSound**: The authors describe it as a recently released audio-visual dataset containing around 200,000 videos. This dataset is crucial for training their model.

2. **SoundNet-Flickr**: This dataset is mentioned as being used for training, with the authors noting that it consists of static images paired with audio samples. The training set is provided by previous works, specifically referenced in the paper.

3. **VGG-SS**: This dataset is used for testing and is noted to have bounding box annotations of sound sources for 5,000 samples.

4. **SoundNet-Flickr-Test**: This dataset is also used for testing and contains 250 samples.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **VGGSound**, the citation is:
  > Honglie Chen, Weidi Xie, Andrea Vedaldi, and Andrew Zisserman. *Vggsound: A large-scale audio-visual dataset*. In ICASSP, 2020.

- For **SoundNet**, the citation is:
  > Yusuf Aytar, Carl Vondrick, and Antonio Torralba. *Soundnet: Learning sound representations from unlabeled video*. In NeurIPS, 2016.

- For **VGG-SS**, the citation is:
  > Honglie Chen, Weidi Xie, Triantafyllos Afouras, Arsha Nagrani, Andrea Vedaldi, and Andrew Zisserman. *Localizing visual sounds the hard way*. In CVPR, 2021.

- For **SoundNet-Flickr**, the citation is:
  > Arda Senocak, Tae-Hyun Oh, Junsik Kim, Ming-Hsuan Yang, and In So Kweon. *Learning to localize sound sources in visual scenes*. In CVPR, 2018.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
