To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Pooling in Graph Convolutional Neural Networks" by Mark Cheung et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions evaluating methods on "popular graph classification datasets," which indicates that datasets are involved. 

Next, I will focus on **section IV (Experiments)**, where the authors discuss the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they explicitly list the datasets and provide descriptions:

1. **MUTAG Dataset**: This dataset consists of chemical compounds represented as graphs, with the task of predicting whether a compound is mutagenic. The authors mention that it contains 188 graphs.

2. **Proteins Dataset**: This dataset consists of proteins represented as graphs, with the objective of predicting whether a protein functions as an enzyme. It contains 1,113 graphs.

3. **IMDB-Binary Dataset**: This dataset corresponds to ego-networks of actors and actresses, where an edge is drawn between two actors if they were cast in the same movie. The task is to predict whether a movie is romance or action, and it contains 1,000 graphs.

4. **Reddit-Binary Dataset**: Each graph in this dataset corresponds to an online discussion thread, with edges drawn between users if one has replied to the other. The task is to predict whether a thread belongs to a discussion forum or a question answering forum, and it contains 2,000 graphs.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The authors reference the following papers for each dataset:

- For **MUTAG Dataset**:

- For **Proteins Dataset**:
  > B. Karsten, C. S. Ong, S. Schnauer, S. Vishwanathan, A. J. Smola, and H.-P. Kriegel. *Protein Function Prediction via Graph Kernels*. Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology, 2005.

- For **IMDB-Binary Dataset**:
  > P. Yanardag and S. Vishwanathan. *Deep Graph Kernels*. In Proceedings of the 21th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, KDD ’15, pp. 1365–1374, 2015.

- For **Reddit-Binary Dataset**:

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes its full citation. This will prepare the information for structured output or further processing.
