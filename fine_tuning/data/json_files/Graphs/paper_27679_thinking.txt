To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Exploring Explicit and Implicit Visual Relationships for Image Captioning" by Zeliang Song and Xiaofei Zhou, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on the **Microsoft COCO benchmark**, which suggests that this dataset is used in their research.

Next, I will examine **section 4.1 (Dataset)**, where the authors provide details about the dataset used for their experiments. They specifically mention that they evaluate their method on the **Microsoft COCO 2014 captions dataset**, which contains images with human-annotated descriptions. The authors also refer to the **Karpathy split** of this dataset, which is a common division used in image captioning tasks.

In this section, the authors provide additional details about the dataset, including the number of images and the nature of the annotations. They mention that each image has at least 5 human-annotated descriptions and that they use a specific split containing 113,287 training images, 5,000 validation images, and 5,000 test images.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Microsoft COCO dataset. The relevant citation is:

- For **Microsoft COCO**:
  > Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, Serge Belongie, et al. *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. In European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), 2014.

With this information, I will summarize the dataset details and ensure that I include the full citation for the Microsoft COCO dataset.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and citation, ready for further processing or review.
