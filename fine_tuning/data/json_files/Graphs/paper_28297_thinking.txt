To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Self-training with Few-shot Rationalization: Teacher Explanations Aid Student in Few-shot NLU" by Meghana Moorthy Bhat et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors discuss the challenges of obtaining large-scale annotated rationales and mention their objective to improve downstream task performance using limited labeled examples. This section may provide insights into the datasets used.

In the **experimental setup section**, the authors provide a detailed description of the datasets they evaluated their framework on. They mention five specific datasets from the ERASER benchmark:

1. **Movies Dataset**: Used for sentiment analysis, containing 1,600 training samples, 200 validation samples, and 200 test samples.

2. **e-SNLI Dataset**: A natural language inference dataset with 547,000 training samples, 9,800 validation samples, and 9,800 test samples.

3. **FEVER Dataset**: A dataset for fact extraction and verification, comprising 98,000 training samples, 6,100 validation samples, and 6,100 test samples.

4. **BoolQ Dataset**: A reading comprehension dataset with 6,300 training samples, 1,400 validation samples, and 972 test samples.

5. **Evidence Dataset**: A dataset over scientific articles for medical interventions, containing 7,900 training samples, 972 validation samples, and 972 test samples.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for the datasets used in the experiments.

The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- **Movies Dataset**:

- **e-SNLI Dataset**:

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited, ready for further processing or review.
