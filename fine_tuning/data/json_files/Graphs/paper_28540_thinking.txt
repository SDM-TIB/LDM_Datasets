To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Augmentations in Graph Contrastive Learning: Current Methodological Flaws & Towards Better Practices" by Puja Trivedi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to gather initial insights about the datasets used. The abstract mentions that the authors analyze the performance of graph contrastive learning frameworks on small benchmark datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be referenced.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Empirical Setup)**, where the authors provide a table (Table 1) listing the datasets used for their experiments. This table includes the following datasets:

1. **IMDB-BINARY**: A dataset used for binary classification of movie reviews.
2. **REDDIT-BINARY**: A dataset for binary classification of Reddit posts.
3. **GOSSIPCOP**: A dataset for classifying news articles.
4. **DEEZER**: A dataset for social network analysis.
5. **GITHUB SGZR**: A dataset for analyzing social interactions on GitHub.
6. **MUTAG**: A dataset for molecular graph classification.
7. **PROTEINS**: A dataset for protein structure classification.
8. **DD**: A dataset for graph classification.
9. **NCI1**: A dataset for chemical compound classification.

I will then verify the details of these datasets in the **experiments section** to confirm their usage and any specific characteristics mentioned by the authors.

After confirming the datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations of these datasets. The paper cites the following references for the datasets:

Now, I will compile the dataset entries along with their full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its respective citation for future reference or processing.
