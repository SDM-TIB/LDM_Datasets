To extract datasets from the research paper titled "When Does Contrastive Visual Representation Learning Work?" by Elijah Cole et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors study contrastive self-supervised learning on **four diverse large-scale datasets**, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Methods)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. They mention:

1. **ImageNet**: A well-known dataset with 1.3 million images across 1,000 classes, used as a standard benchmark in computer vision.
2. **iNat21**: The 2021 iNaturalist Challenge dataset, which contains 2.7 million images covering 10,000 species.
3. **Places365**: A dataset with 1.8 million images across 365 scene categories, specifically designed for scene recognition tasks.
4. **GLC20**: A collection of remote sensing images with 1 million training images covering 16 land cover classes.

In **section 4 (Experiments)**, the authors further elaborate on their experimental setup using these datasets, confirming their relevance and application in the study.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **ImageNet**, the citation is:

With these citations in hand, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
