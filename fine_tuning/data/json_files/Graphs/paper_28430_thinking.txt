To extract datasets from the research paper titled "GRAPE for Fast and Scalable Graph Processing and random walk-based Embedding" by Luca Cappelletti et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, results, and methods sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that GRAPE provides access to "over 80,000 graphs from the literature and other sources," which indicates that there are multiple datasets involved.

Next, I will focus on the **results section**, particularly section 2.5, where the authors discuss the performance of GRAPE on various large real-world graphs. They specifically mention three datasets used for their experiments:

1. **English Wikipedia graph**: This dataset is constructed from the Wikipedia network, which is a well-known large-scale graph used for various graph processing tasks.

2. **Comparative Toxicogenomic Database (CTD)**: This dataset is referenced as a biomedical graph, which is commonly used in research related to toxicogenomics.

3. **PheKnowLator biomedical graph**: This graph is generated through the PheKnowLator framework, which is designed for biomedical knowledge representation.

In the **methods section**, the authors provide additional context about how these datasets are utilized within the GRAPE framework, but they do not provide full citations for the datasets. Therefore, I will need to look up the full citations for each dataset in the **References section**.

Now, I will compile the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **Comparative Toxicogenomic Database (CTD)**, the citation is:
  > Davis, A. P., Grondin, C. J., Johnson, R. J., Sciaky, D., Wiegers, T., & Mattingly, C. J. (2020). Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD): update 2021. *Nucleic Acids Research*, 49(D1), D1138–D1143.

- For the **PheKnowLator biomedical graph**, the citation is:
  > Callahan, T. J., Tripodi, I. J., Hunter, L. E., & Baumgartner, W. A. (2020). A framework for automated construction of heterogeneous large-scale biomedical knowledge graphs. In *Bio-Ontologies COSI - Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology*.

- The **English Wikipedia graph** does not have a specific citation in the paper, but it is commonly referenced in the literature. A general citation could be:
  > Leskovec, J., & Sosič, R. (2016). SNAP: A general-purpose network analysis and graph-mining library. *ACM Transactions on Intelligent Systems and Technology (TIST)*, 8(1), 1.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets and their citations in a structured format for easy reference. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations for future use or verification.
