To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learn from Zoom: Decoupled Supervised Contrastive Learning for WCE Image Classification" by Kunpeng Qiu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their method on a blend of two publicly accessible WCE datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe their dataset. Here, they mention that they evaluated their method on a combined dataset of 3022 images, merging two datasets: **CAD-CAP** and **KID**. The paper specifies the number of images in each dataset and the classes included, which is crucial information for dataset extraction.

In this section, the authors provide the following details:
1. **CAD-CAP Dataset**: Contains 1812 images.
2. **KID Dataset**: Contains 1210 images.
The combined dataset includes three classes: normal images (1300 images), vascular lesions (888 images), and inflammatory lesions (834 images).

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The relevant citations are:

Romain, S. Sacher-Huvelin, C. Simon-Shane, G. Vanbiervliet, P. Marteau, A. Histace, and X. Dray. “CAD-CAP: a 25,000-image database serving the development of artificial intelligence for capsule endoscopy.” *Endoscopy International Open*, vol. 8, no. 3, pp. E415–E420.

- For **KID Dataset**:

Tontini. “KID project: an internet-based digital video atlas of capsule endoscopy for research purposes.” *Endoscopy International Open*, vol. 5, no. 6, pp. E477–E483.

With this information, I can now summarize the datasets extracted from the paper, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.
