To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Authentication and Integrity of Smartphone Videos through Multimedia Container Structure Analysis" by Carlos Quinto Huamána et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors have generated a dataset of videos for their analysis, which is a good starting point.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Multimedia Container Structure Analysis)**, particularly **subsection 3.1 (Dataset Preparation)**, where the authors describe the datasets they created. Here, they mention a total of **1957 original videos** generated by **86 devices, 66 models, and 11 brands**. This is a significant dataset that I need to document.

The authors also mention **3682 videos shared through social networks** and **1084 videos shared through instant messaging applications**. Additionally, they manipulated **721 videos** using **five editing programs**. Each of these datasets is crucial for understanding the scope of their research.

Now, I will look for the **full citations** for these datasets in the **References section**. The paper does not provide specific citations for the datasets themselves, but it does reference various studies and standards related to video formats and forensic analysis. I will note that the datasets are original contributions of the authors and do not have external citations.

Here’s a summary of the datasets I will extract:

1. **Original Video Dataset**: 
   - Description: A dataset of 1957 original videos generated by 86 devices, 66 models, and 11 brands.
   - Citation: Quinto Huamána, C., Sandoval Orozco, A.L., García Villalba, L.J. (2024). Authentication and Integrity of Smartphone Videos through Multimedia Container Structure Analysis. *Preprint submitted to Elsevier*.

2. **Social Networks Video Dataset**: 
   - Description: A dataset of 3682 videos shared through various social networks.
   - Citation: Quinto Huamána, C., Sandoval Orozco, A.L., García Villalba, L.J. (2024). Authentication and Integrity of Smartphone Videos through Multimedia Container Structure Analysis. *Preprint submitted to Elsevier*.

3. **Instant Messaging Applications Video Dataset**: 
   - Description: A dataset of 1084 videos shared through instant messaging applications.
   - Citation: Quinto Huamána, C., Sandoval Orozco, A.L., García Villalba, L.J. (2024). Authentication and Integrity of Smartphone Videos through Multimedia Container Structure Analysis. *Preprint submitted to Elsevier*.

4. **Edited Video Dataset**: 
   - Description: A dataset of 721 videos manipulated using five editing programs.
   - Citation: Quinto Huamána, C., Sandoval Orozco, A.L., García Villalba, L.J. (2024). Authentication and Integrity of Smartphone Videos through Multimedia Container Structure Analysis. *Preprint submitted to Elsevier*.

After gathering this information, I will compile it into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations as required.
