To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Finding the Law: Enhancing Statutory Article Retrieval via Graph Neural Networks" by Antoine Louis et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on a "real-world expert-annotated SAR dataset," which suggests that a specific dataset is being used.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experimental Setup)**, particularly **subsection 4.1 (Dataset)**, where the authors describe the dataset used for their experiments. Here, they mention the **Belgian Statutory Article Retrieval Dataset (BSARD)**, which is crucial for understanding the context of their research.

In this subsection, the authors provide details about the dataset:
- The BSARD consists of over 1,100 French native questions on various legal topics, labeled by experts with references to relevant statutory articles from Belgian legislation.
- The retrieval corpus includes over 22,600 articles collected from 32 Belgian codes.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the BSARD dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:
> Antoine Louis and Gerasimos Spanakis. *A statutory article retrieval dataset in French*. In Proceedings of the 60th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers), pages 6789â€“6803, 2022.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity.

The dataset entry will include:
- The name of the dataset: Belgian Statutory Article Retrieval Dataset (BSARD)
- A brief description of the dataset's contents and purpose
- The full citation for the dataset as provided in the references

After gathering all this information, I will ensure that it is presented clearly and accurately, ready for any further processing or review.
