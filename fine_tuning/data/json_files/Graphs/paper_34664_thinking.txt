To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DUPLEX: Dual GAT for Complex Embedding of Directed Graphs" by Zhaoru Ke et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. In the abstract, the authors discuss their method's performance on various tasks but do not specify datasets. The introduction provides context about the importance of directed graphs but does not name any datasets either.

Next, I will look into **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, which is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets used in the experiments. Here, I find that the authors explicitly list five datasets used for their experiments:

1. **Cora-ml**: A subset of the Cora dataset, specifically for machine learning research. It contains 8,416 nodes and 2,995 edges.
2. **Citeseer**: A citation network dataset with 4,715 nodes and 3,312 edges.
3. **Cora**: The original Cora dataset, which has 91,500 nodes and 23,166 edges.
4. **Epinions**: A social network dataset with 75,879 nodes and 508,837 edges.
5. **Twitter**: Another social network dataset with 93,939 nodes and 834,797 edges.

In this section, the authors also provide some characteristics of these datasets, such as the number of directed edges and feature dimensions.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The paper cites the following sources for the datasets:

- For **Cora-ml** and **Citeseer**, the citation is:
  > Zhang, X., He, Y., Brugnone, N., Perlmutter, M., & Hirn, M. J. (2021). Magnet: A neural network for directed graphs. In Proceedings of the 35th International Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems, volume 34, pp. 27003–27015.

- For **Cora**, the citation is:
  > Subelj, L., & Bajec, M. (2013). Model of complex networks based on citation dynamics. In Proceedings of the 22nd International Conference on World Wide Web, pp. 527–530.

- For **Epinions** and **Twitter**, the datasets are sourced from the Stanford Large Network Dataset Collection:
  > Leskovec, J., & Krevl, A. (2014). SNAP Datasets: Stanford Large Network Dataset Collection. http://snap.stanford.edu/data.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and future reference. Each dataset will include its name, a brief description, and the full citation.
