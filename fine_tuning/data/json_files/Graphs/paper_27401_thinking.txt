To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Session-based Social and Dependency-aware Software Recommendation" by Dengcheng Yan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that extensive experiments were conducted on real-world datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed present. I will look for specific names or descriptions of these datasets.

Next, I will focus on **section 5.1 (Experimental Settings)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they mention integrating datasets from **GHTorrent** and **Libraries.io** to extract three datasets based on programming languages: **PHP**, **Ruby**, and **JavaScript**. I will note the details provided for each dataset, including the number of developers, software packages, interactions, and any specific criteria for inclusion.

The paper provides statistics for each dataset:
1. **PHP Dataset**: 
   - Number of Developers: 7,095
   - Number of Software Packages: 1,487
   - Number of Interactions: 118,256
   - Average Friends per Developer: 8.59
   - Average Dependencies per Package: 4.56
   - Average Session Length: 2.95

2. **Ruby Dataset**: 
   - Number of Developers: 5,935
   - Number of Software Packages: 8,144
   - Number of Interactions: 116,832
   - Average Friends per Developer: 13.05
   - Average Dependencies per Package: 5.09
   - Average Session Length: 3.13

3. **JavaScript Dataset**: 
   - Number of Developers: 1,402
   - Number of Software Packages: 2,282
   - Number of Interactions: 436,409
   - Average Friends per Developer: 16.24
   - Average Dependencies per Package: 10.09
   - Average Session Length: 3.25

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper does not provide specific citations for the datasets themselves, but it does reference the sources from which the datasets were derived:
- **GHTorrent**: Georgios Gousios. *The ghtorrent dataset and tool suite*. In Proceedings of the 10th Working Conference on Mining Software Repositories, MSR ’13, pages 233–236. IEEE Press, 2013.
- **Libraries.io**: The dataset is mentioned as being available at https://libraries.io/data, but no formal citation is provided in the references.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the relevant statistics and citations for each dataset. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for further processing or review.
