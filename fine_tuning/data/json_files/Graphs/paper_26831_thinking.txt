To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Feature Distillation With Guided Adversarial Contrastive Learning" by Tao Bai et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. In the abstract, the authors mention conducting experiments on "popular datasets such as CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and STL-10." This indicates that these datasets are likely to be important for the study.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **Datasets** section, which is often included in research papers. In this case, I find that the authors explicitly list the datasets used in their experiments:

1. **CIFAR-10**: The paper states that CIFAR-10 contains 60,000 images across 10 classes, with 50,000 for training and 10,000 for testing.

2. **CIFAR-100**: This dataset is described as similar to CIFAR-10 but contains 100 classes, each with 600 images.

3. **STL-10**: The authors mention that STL-10 has a training set of 50,000 labeled images from 10 classes and 100,000 unlabeled images, along with a test set of 8,000 images.

To confirm the details and obtain full citations for these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper:

- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
  > Krizhevsky, A., Hinton, G., et al. (2009). *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. 

- For **CIFAR-100**, the citation is:
  > Krizhevsky, A., Hinton, G., et al. (2009). *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*.

- For **STL-10**, the citation is:
  > Coates, A., Ng, A., & Lee, H. (2011). *An analysis of single-layer networks in unsupervised feature learning*. In Proceedings of the fourteenth international conference on artificial intelligence and statistics, 215–223.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will summarize the findings:

1. **CIFAR-10**: A dataset with 60,000 images in 10 classes (50,000 training, 10,000 testing).
   - Citation: Krizhevsky, A., Hinton, G., et al. (2009). *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*.

2. **CIFAR-100**: Similar to CIFAR-10 but with 100 classes (600 images each).
   - Citation: Krizhevsky, A., Hinton, G., et al. (2009). *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*.

3. **STL-10**: Contains 50,000 labeled images from 10 classes and 100,000 unlabeled images, with a test set of 8,000 images.
   - Citation: Coates, A., Ng, A., & Lee, H. (2011). *An analysis of single-layer networks in unsupervised feature learning*. In Proceedings of the fourteenth international conference on artificial intelligence and statistics, 215–223.

With this information, I can now compile the dataset entries for further processing or review.
