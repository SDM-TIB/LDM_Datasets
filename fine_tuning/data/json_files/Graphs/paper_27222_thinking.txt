To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Cross-Modal Contrastive Learning of Representations for Navigation using Lightweight, Low-Cost Millimeter Wave Radar for Adverse Environmental Conditions" by Jui-Te Huang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their method using real-world data, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section V (Evaluation)**, where the authors describe their data collection process. They mention that they collected range data from four 60-GHz TI 6843 mmWave radar modules and a Velodyne VLP-16 LiDAR. This section provides crucial details about the dataset, including the number of frames recorded and the environments in which the data was collected.

The authors state that a total of **110,381 frames (approximately 6 robot hours)** were recorded in various environments, including corridors, parking areas, and outdoor open areas. This information is essential for describing the dataset.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper does not provide specific citations for the datasets themselves, but it does reference the LiDAR system used:

- For **Velodyne VLP-16 LiDAR**, the citation is:
  > Velodyne Lidar, Inc. *VLP-16 Lidar Sensor*. [Online]. Available: https://velodynelidar.com/products/vlp-16/

The mmWave radar modules are referenced in the context of their specifications but do not have a specific citation in the references. However, I can note that they are commercially available sensors.

Next, I will summarize the datasets extracted from the paper:

1. **Dataset of mmWave Radar and LiDAR Data**: This dataset consists of range data collected from four 60-GHz TI 6843 mmWave radar modules and a Velodyne VLP-16 LiDAR. It includes a total of 110,381 frames recorded in various environments (corridors, parking areas, and outdoor open areas).

Now, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing. This will include the dataset name, description, and full citation where applicable.
