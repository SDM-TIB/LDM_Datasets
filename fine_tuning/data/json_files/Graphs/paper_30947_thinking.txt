To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Higher order organizational features can distinguish protein interaction networks of disease classes: a case study of neoplasms and neurological diseases" by Vikram Singh, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study and may mention the datasets used. In this case, it states that the authors examined **112 and 175 protein interaction networks** belonging to neoplasms and neurological diseases, respectively. This indicates that there are datasets related to these disease classes.

Next, I will look into the **Methods section**, specifically **section 2.1 (Data acquisition and disease network construction)**, where the authors describe how they constructed the disease networks. They mention using **DisGeNET**, which is a comprehensive resource for disease-gene associations, and they specify the number of diseases and genes involved. This section confirms the datasets used for the analysis.

The authors state that they constructed **220 protein interaction networks** (112 for neoplasms and 175 for neurological diseases) based on gene associations from DisGeNET. This is crucial information for dataset extraction.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The relevant citations are:

1. **DisGeNET**: 
   > Piñero, J., et al. (2020). "DisGeNET: a comprehensive platform integrating information on human disease-associated genes and variants." *Nucleic Acids Research*, 48(D1), D845–D855. doi:10.1093/nar/gkz1021.

2. **STRING Database**: 
   > Szklarczyk, D., et al. (2021). "STRING v11.5: protein-protein association networks with increased coverage, supporting functional discovery in genome-wide experimental datasets." *Nucleic Acids Research*, 49(D1), D605–D612. doi:10.1093/nar/gkaa1074.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

- **Dataset 1**: Protein interaction networks for neoplasms (112 networks).
- **Dataset 2**: Protein interaction networks for neurological diseases (175 networks).
- **Dataset 3**: DisGeNET for disease-gene associations.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries with their full citations, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and attributed to its source. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture the datasets referenced in the paper.
