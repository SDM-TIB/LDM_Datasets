To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Zero-shot Recognition via Semantic Embeddings and Knowledge Graphs" by Xiaolong Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the use of a knowledge graph and semantic embeddings, which suggests that datasets may be involved in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors describe their methodology and the datasets used. In this section, they explicitly mention two datasets:

1. **NELL (Never-Ending Language Learning)**: This dataset is constructed from publicly available knowledge bases and is used to demonstrate the robustness of their approach. The authors note that it contains a large number of object entities and relationships.

2. **NEIL (Never-Ending Image Learning)**: This dataset provides images corresponding to the object nodes in the NELL dataset. The authors explain that they use images from NEIL to train their model.

In the **dataset settings subsection**, the authors provide specific details about how they constructed a knowledge graph based on NELL and NEIL. They mention the number of nodes and edges in the graph, which indicates the scale of the datasets involved.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **NELL**, the citation is:
  > Carlson, A., Betteridge, J., Kisiel, B., Settles, B., R. H. Jr., E., & Mitchell, T. M. (2010). *Toward an architecture for never-ending language learning*. In AAAI.

- For **NEIL**, the citation is:
  > Chen, X., Shrivastava, A., & Gupta, A. (2013). *Neil: Extracting visual knowledge from web data*. In ICCV.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and that the full citations are included. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, which is essential for reproducibility and further research.
