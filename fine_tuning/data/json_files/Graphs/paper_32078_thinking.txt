To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Cook-Gen: Robust Generative Modeling of Cooking Actions from Recipes" by Revathy Venkataramanan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to gather initial insights about the datasets used in the research. The abstract mentions the use of generative AI methods to analyze recipes, which suggests that there may be a dataset involved in this analysis.

Next, I will focus on **section III (Description of the Dataset and Task)**, where the authors explicitly describe the dataset they utilized. Here, they mention the **Recipe1M dataset**, which is a comprehensive collection of 1 million high-quality recipes, including titles, ingredients, cooking instructions, and images. This section provides a clear description of the dataset's contents and its relevance to the study.

In this section, the authors also explain how they engaged graduate students to identify cooking actions from a sample of 10,000 recipe texts. This indicates that they not only used the Recipe1M dataset but also created a subset of annotated data for their specific task.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Recipe1M dataset. The citation is as follows:
> A. Salvador, N. Hynes, Y. Aytar, J. Marin, F. Ofli, I. Weber, and A. Torralba. *Learning cross-modal embeddings for cooking recipes and food images*. In Proceedings of the IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pages 3020â€“3028, 2017.

Since the authors did not mention any other datasets in the paper, I will compile the information about the Recipe1M dataset, including its citation, into a structured format for clarity.

Finally, I will ensure that the dataset entry is complete and ready for any further processing or review.
