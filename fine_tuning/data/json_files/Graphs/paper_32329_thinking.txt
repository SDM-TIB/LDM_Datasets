To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Power Allocation for Device-to-Device Interference Channel Using Truncated Graph Transformers" by Dohoon Kim and Shenghui Song, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and numerical experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of deep learning architectures for power control in wireless communications, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine the **numerical experiments section** where the authors describe their experimental setup. Here, they mention that the models were trained on a dataset of **25,000 network instances**, which consists of **50 randomly sampled channel states** on **500 randomly sampled network topologies**. This indicates that there is a dataset used for training, but I need to find out if there are any specific names or references for this dataset.

I will also check the **references section** to see if any datasets are cited or if there are any papers that describe the datasets used. The authors reference several works related to power allocation and graph neural networks, but they do not provide a specific citation for the dataset they used.

Since the dataset is described in terms of its characteristics (25,000 instances, 50 channel states, 500 topologies), I will summarize this information as follows:

1. **Wireless Power Allocation Dataset**: This dataset consists of 25,000 network instances, each containing 50 randomly sampled channel states on 500 randomly sampled network topologies. However, there is no formal citation provided for this dataset in the paper.

Finally, I will compile the information I have gathered about the dataset, noting that while the dataset is described, it lacks a formal citation. This is important to highlight, as it may affect the reproducibility of the research.

Now, I will prepare the dataset entry based on the information extracted, ensuring to note the absence of a formal citation for the dataset.
