To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Bi-CLKT: Bi-Graph Contrastive Learning based Knowledge Tracing" by Xiangyu Song et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. In the abstract, the authors mention that they conducted extensive experiments on four real-world datasets. This indicates that there are specific datasets that I need to identify.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments in **section 5.1 (Datasets)**. Here, they provide the names of the datasets along with brief descriptions.

The datasets mentioned are:

1. **ASSISTment 2009**: This dataset is provided by the online tutorial website ASSISTment and is widely used for validating Knowledge Tracing problems. It includes accurate labels and practice data.

2. **ASSISTment 2015**: Similar to the 2009 dataset, this dataset clarifies the data collected in 2009 by collapsing the number of concepts and introducing a larger number of students.

3. **ASSISTment Challenge**: Collected for a data mining competition run by ASSISTments in 2017, this dataset has a high degree of completeness and normality.

4. **STATICS 2011**: This dataset is course-specific and contains interactions between students and concepts, making it the most intensive of the four datasets.

Now, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:

- For **ASSISTment 2009**, the citation is:
  > A. T. Corbett, J. R. Anderson. "Knowledge tracing: Modeling the acquisition of procedural knowledge." *User modeling and user-adapted interaction*, 4(4), 253–278, 1994. [Link](https://sites.google.com/site/assistmentsdata/home/assistment-2009-2010-data)

- For **ASSISTment 2015**, the citation is:
  > A. T. Corbett, J. R. Anderson. "Knowledge tracing: Modeling the acquisition of procedural knowledge." *User modeling and user-adapted interaction*, 4(4), 253–278, 1994. [Link](https://sites.google.com/site/assistmentsdata/home/2015-assistments-concept-builder-data)

- For **ASSISTment Challenge**, the citation is:
  > A. T. Corbett, J. R. Anderson. "Knowledge tracing: Modeling the acquisition of procedural knowledge." *User modeling and user-adapted interaction*, 4(4), 253–278, 1994. [Link](https://sites.google.com/view/assistmentsdatamining/dataset)

- For **STATICS 2011**, the citation is:
  > A. T. Corbett, J. R. Anderson. "Knowledge tracing: Modeling the acquisition of procedural knowledge." *User modeling and user-adapted interaction*, 4(4), 253–278, 1994. [Link](https://pslcdatashop.web.cmu.edu/DatasetInfo?datasetId=507)

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that I have accurately captured all necessary details for each dataset.
