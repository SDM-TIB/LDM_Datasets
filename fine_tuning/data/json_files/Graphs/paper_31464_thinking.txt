To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Preventing Dimensional Collapse of Incomplete Multi-View Clustering via Direct Contrastive Learning" by Kaiwu Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the method was evaluated on **5 public datasets**, which indicates that there are specific datasets to look for.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly the part where the authors describe their experimental setup. In this section, they mention the datasets used for testing and provide details about each one. I will look for a subsection titled **"1) Datasets Descriptions"** where they list the datasets.

The paper describes the following datasets:

1. **BDGP Dataset**: This dataset consists of images of drosophila embryos, containing 2,500 samples across 5 classes, with each sample having two views of 1750-dimensional visual features and 79-dimensional textual features.

2. **MNIST-USPS Dataset**: This dataset contains 5,000 samples across 10 categories, with two views derived from the MNIST and USPS datasets.

3. **Caltech Dataset**: An image dataset constructed into a dual-view dataset for evaluation.

4. **Fashion Dataset**: A dataset with 10,000 samples of products, where two different styles are treated as two views.

5. **Noisy MNIST Dataset**: This dataset is a variant of the MNIST dataset, containing 20,000 samples with Gaussian noise added to the images.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets mentioned in the paper are as follows:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use.
