To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Open Set Domain Recognition via Attention-Based GCN and Semantic Matching Optimization" by Xinxing He et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the challenges of open set domain recognition and hints at the datasets used for evaluation. The introduction provides context about the problem but does not explicitly name any datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors describe their experiments in section IV, where they mention two datasets: **I2AwA** and **I2CIFAR**.

1. **I2AwA Dataset**: The authors state that the target domain of I2AwA is AwA2, which contains 50 animal classes and a total of 37,322 images. This dataset is crucial for their experiments, particularly in evaluating the performance of their proposed method under different openness settings.

2. **I2CIFAR Dataset**: The source domain consists of 1130 simulated images belonging to 15 classes, while the target domain includes 45 classes from the CIFAR dataset. This dataset is also significant for their experiments, especially in assessing the method's robustness across different datasets.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **AwA2 dataset**, the citation is:
  > Xian, Y., Schiele, B., & Akata, Z. (2017). *Zero-shot learning—the good, the bad and the ugly*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pp. 4582–4591.

- For the **CIFAR dataset**, the citation is:
  > Krizhevsky, A., & Hinton, G. (2009). *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. Technical Report, University of Toronto.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and includes its full citation. This structured approach will help in accurately documenting the datasets used in the research paper.
