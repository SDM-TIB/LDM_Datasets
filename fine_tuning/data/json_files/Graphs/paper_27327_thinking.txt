To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Meta-Path-Free Representation Learning on Heterogeneous Networks" by Jie Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on three real-world heterogeneous networks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 5) where the authors provide details about the datasets used. In this section, they explicitly mention three datasets:

1. **DBLP**: This dataset is described as containing 14,328 papers, 4,057 authors, 20 conferences, and 8,811 terms. The authors note that the "Terms" are processed as features of the "Papers." The dataset is used for node classification tasks with four classes for authors.

2. **IMDB**: This dataset consists of 3,015 movies, 4,293 actors, and 1,676 directors. The movies are categorized into three classes: Action, Comedy, and Drama. This dataset is also used for node classification tasks.

3. **AMiner**: This dataset includes 4,162 scientists, 14,209 papers, and 2,179 conferences. The authors mention that there are eight classes for scientists, covering various fields in computer science.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For the **DBLP dataset**, the citation is:
> Yizhou Sun and Jiawei Han. "Mining heterogeneous information networks: a structural analysis approach." ACM Sigkdd Explorations Newsletter, 14(2):20–28, 2013.

For the **IMDB dataset**, the citation is:
> Giles, C. Lee. "The future of citeseer: citeseer x." In European Conference on Machine Learning, pages 2–2. Springer, 2006.

For the **AMiner dataset**, the citation is:
> Tang, J., et al. "AMiner: A Research Network for Academic Social Networks." In Proceedings of the 2018 ACM on Conference on Information and Knowledge Management, pages 1-10. ACM, 2018.

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This structured approach will help in accurately documenting the datasets used in the research.
