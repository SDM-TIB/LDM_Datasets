To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Political Depolarization of News Articles Using Attribute-aware Word Embeddings" by Ruibo Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the research focus and any datasets that may be referenced. The abstract mentions that the authors trained a model on **360k full-length media articles**, which indicates a significant dataset used for their experiments.

Next, I will look into the **implementation section**, specifically under the **Datasets** subsection, where the authors describe their data collection process. Here, they mention that the data was collected from **Media Cloud**, which is an academic research project that aggregates articles from various media outlets. They specify that they collected around **360k full-length articles** from May 1st, 2018, to May 1st, 2019, and that these articles were labeled with ideological polarity based on data from the **Pew Research Center**.

I will also note the specific topics covered in their dataset, which include **11 topics** related to political issues, as indicated in the paper. This detailed description of the dataset will be crucial for understanding the context in which the data was used.

Now, I will gather the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The citation for the **Media Cloud** dataset is as follows:
> Media Cloud. *An academic research project led by MIT and Harvard University*. Available at: https://mediacloud.org/

Additionally, the citation for the **Pew Research Center** data used for ideological labeling is:
> Pew Research Center. *Survey of news consumption by people with different political affiliation*. Available at: https://www.journalism.org/interactives/media-polarization/table/overall/

After compiling this information, I will ensure that I have accurately documented the datasets and their citations, as this is essential for proper attribution and further research.

Finally, I will summarize the findings in a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset, its description, and the corresponding citations, ready for any downstream processing or review.
