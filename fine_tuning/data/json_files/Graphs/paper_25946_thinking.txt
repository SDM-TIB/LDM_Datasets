To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Predict Then Propagate: Graph Neural Networks Meet Personalized PageRank" by Johannes Klicpera et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically looking for any tables or figures that summarize the datasets. In this paper, there is a **Table 1** that lists dataset statistics, which is crucial for identifying the datasets used in the experiments.

In **Table 1**, I will note the following datasets mentioned:

1. **CITESEER**: A citation dataset with 2,110 nodes, 3,703 edges, and 6 classes.
2. **CORA-ML**: Another citation dataset with 2,810 nodes, 2,879 edges, and 7 classes.
3. **PUBMED**: A citation dataset with 19,717 nodes, 68,05 edges, and 3 classes.
4. **MS ACADEMIC Co-author**: A co-authorship dataset with 18,333 nodes, 81,894 edges, and 15 classes.

Next, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are typically provided in the references, and I will ensure to extract the correct ones for each dataset.

The full citations I will include are:

- For **CITESEER**:
  > Sen, P., Namata, B., Bilgic, M., Getoor, L., Gallagher, B., & Eliassi-Rad, T. (2008). Collective Classification in Network Data. *AI Magazine*, 29(3), 93-106.

- For **CORA-ML**:
  > McCallum, A. K., Nigam, K., Rennie, J., & Seymore, K. (2000). Automating the Construction of Internet Portals with Machine Learning. *Information Retrieval*, 3(2), 127-163.

- For **PUBMED**:
  > Namata, B., London, G., Getoor, L., & Huang, B. (2012). Query-driven Active Surveying for Collective Classification. In *International Workshop on Mining and Learning with Graphs (MLG)*.

- For **MS ACADEMIC Co-author**:
  > Shchur, O., Mumme, M., Bojchevski, A., & GÃ¼ndemann, S. (2018). Pitfalls of Graph Neural Network Evaluation. In *NeurIPS*.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described with its corresponding citation. This structured approach will help in maintaining clarity and completeness in the dataset extraction process.
