To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Implicit Coordination Graphs for Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning" by Sheng Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions and may mention specific datasets used for evaluation. 

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors often discuss the context of their research and may reference datasets that are foundational to their work. Here, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or benchmarks.

In the **results section**, the authors typically describe the experiments conducted and the datasets used. I will pay close attention to any subsections that detail the experimental setup, as these often include specific datasets.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention two key datasets used in their experiments:

1. **StarCraft II Multi-Agent Challenge (SMAC)**: This dataset is used for evaluating the performance of multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithms in a complex environment. The authors reference the original work that introduced this challenge.

2. **Traffic Junction Environment**: This dataset is used to test the coordination capabilities of agents in a traffic scenario. The authors also provide a reference to the original paper that introduced this environment.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to gather the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **StarCraft II Multi-Agent Challenge (SMAC)**, the citation is:
  > Mikayel Samvelyan, Tabish Rashid, Christian Schroeder de Witt, Gregory Farquhar, Nantas Nardelli, Tim GJ Rudner, Chia-Man Hung, Philip HS Torr, Jakob Foerster, and Shimon Whiteson. *The Starcraft multi-agent challenge*. In International Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems (AAMAS), International Foundation for Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems, 2186–2188, 2019.

- For the **Traffic Junction Environment**, the citation is:
  > Sainbayar Sukhbaatar and Rob Fergus. *Learning multiagent communication with backpropagation*. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS), 2244–2252, 2016.

With these citations in hand, I will now summarize the datasets:

1. **StarCraft II Multi-Agent Challenge (SMAC)**: A benchmark designed for multi-agent environments that tests coordination and micromanagement skills in complex scenarios.

2. **Traffic Junction Environment**: A multi-agent environment where agents must navigate traffic junctions while avoiding collisions, requiring effective coordination.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation.
