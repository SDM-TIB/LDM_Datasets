To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MoNET: Tackle State Momentum via Noise-Enhanced Training for Dialogue State Tracking" by Haoning Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that "Experimental results on MultiWOZ datasets show that MoNET outperforms previous DST methods." This indicates that datasets are involved, specifically the MultiWOZ datasets.

Next, I will look into **section 4 (Experiment Setting)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. They state that they chose **MultiWOZ 2.0, 2.1, and 2.4** as their datasets. The paper describes MultiWOZ as a standard human-human conversational dialogue corpus with seven domains, and it mentions that MultiWOZ 2.1 has re-annotated some incorrect state labels from the 2.0 version. MultiWOZ 2.4 is noted as the latest refined version correcting all incorrect state labels in validation and test sets.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and cited according to the specified format. This will include the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation for each dataset.
