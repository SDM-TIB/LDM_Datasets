To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "Joint Embedding of Structural and Functional Brain Networks with Graph Neural Networks for Mental Illness Diagnosis" by Yanqiao Zhu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on two real-world disease datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly subsection A, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they describe two datasets:

1. **HIV Dataset**: This dataset consists of 35 patients with HIV and 35 seronegative controls. Each modality graph has 90 nodes, and the edge weights are calculated based on correlations between brain regions. The dataset is constructed following the methodology outlined by Cao et al. (2015).

2. **Bipolar Disorder (BP) Dataset**: This dataset includes 52 bipolar subjects in a euthymic state and 45 healthy controls, with 82 brain regions stimulated according to Freesurfer-generated cortical and subcortical gray matter regions. The authors used the CONN toolbox for constructing the brain network.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **HIV Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Bokai Cao, Xiangnan Kong, Jingyuan Zhang, Philip S. Yu, and Ann B. Ragin. *Identifying HIV-Induced Subgraph Patterns in Brain Networks with Side Information*. Brain Informatics, vol. 2, no. 4, pp. 211â€“223, 2015.

- For the **Bipolar Disorder Dataset**, there is no specific citation provided in the paper, but it is mentioned that the data was processed using the CONN toolbox, which is a widely used software for functional connectivity analysis in neuroimaging.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets used in the research.
