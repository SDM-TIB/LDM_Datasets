To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Eliciting Structural and Semantic Global Knowledge in Unsupervised Graph Contrastive Learning" by Kaize Ding et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. In the abstract, the authors mention that their experiments are conducted on several public benchmark datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed used in their research.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments in **section 4.1 (Experimental Settings)**. They mention six public benchmark datasets: **Cora**, **Citeseer**, **Pubmed**, **Amazon-P**, **Coauthor CS**, and **ogbn-arxiv**.

I will then gather detailed information about each dataset, including the number of nodes, edges, features, and classes, as provided in **Table 4** of the paper. This table summarizes the statistics of the datasets, which is crucial for understanding their characteristics.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations for the datasets mentioned in the paper are as follows:

1. **Cora**:
   > Sen, P., Namata, G., Bilgic, M., Getoor, L., Galligher, B., & Eliassi-Rad, T. (2008). Collective classification in network data. *AI Magazine*.

2. **Citeseer**:
   > Sen, P., Namata, G., Bilgic, M., Getoor, L., Galligher, B., & Eliassi-Rad, T. (2008). Collective classification in network data. *AI Magazine*.

3. **Pubmed**:
   > Namata, G., London, B., Getoor, L., Huang, B., & EDU, U. (2012). Query-driven active surveying for collective classification. In *Workshop on MLG*.

4. **Amazon-P**:
   > Shchur, O., Mumme, M., Bojchevski, A., & Günnemann, S. (2018). Pitfalls of Graph Neural Network Evaluation. In *NeurIPS Relational Representation Learning Workshop*.

5. **Coauthor CS**:
   > Shchur, O., Mumme, M., Bojchevski, A., & Günnemann, S. (2018). Pitfalls of Graph Neural Network Evaluation. In *NeurIPS Relational Representation Learning Workshop*.

6. **ogbn-arxiv**:
   > Hu, W., Fey, M., Zitnik, M., Dong, Y., Ren, H., Liu, B., Catasta, M., & Leskovec, J. (2020). Open graph benchmark: Datasets for machine learning on graphs. In *NeurIPS*.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described with its relevant statistics and full citation. This structured approach will help in accurately extracting and documenting the datasets used in the research paper.
