To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Differentiable Reasoning about Knowledge Graphs with Region-based Graph Neural Networks" by Aleksandar Pavlović et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract and introduction** sections for any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the paper discusses knowledge graph (KG) completion and mentions "standard benchmarks for KG completion," which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In the provided text, it is noted that the authors evaluate their model on three standard benchmarks for inductive knowledge graph completion: **FB15k-237**, **WN18RR**, and **NELL-995**. Each of these benchmarks consists of multiple dataset variants (v1 to v4), which is crucial information for dataset extraction.

I will then gather specific details about each dataset, including the number of entities, relations, and triples, as mentioned in **Table 1** of the paper. This table provides a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the experiments, including their splits (train, validation, and test).

Now, I will compile the full citations for each dataset based on the references provided in the paper. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

1. **FB15k-237**:
   > Bordes, A., Usunier, N., García-Durán, A., Weston, J., & Yakhnenko, O. (2013). Translating embeddings for modeling multi-relational data. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS 2013).

2. **WN18RR**:
   > Miller, G. A. (1995). Wordnet: A lexical database for English. Communications of the ACM, 38(11), 39-41.

3. **NELL-995**:
   > Carlson, A., Betteridge, J., Kisiel, B., Settles, B., & Mitchell, T. M. (2010). Toward an architecture for never-ending language learning. In Proceedings of the Twenty-Fourth AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI 2010).

After gathering this information, I will ensure that I format the dataset entries correctly, including the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ready for structured output or further processing.
