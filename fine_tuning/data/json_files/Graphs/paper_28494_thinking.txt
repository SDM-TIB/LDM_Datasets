To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Degree-Based Random Walk Approach for Graph Embedding" by Sarmad N. Mohammed and Semra Gündüç, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of graph representation learning and mention that they will conduct experiments using specific networks. This indicates that datasets are likely to be detailed in the experimental section.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental results section** where the authors present their findings. Here, they explicitly mention three datasets used for their experiments:

1. **Zachary Karate Club Network**: A well-known small network used for community detection, consisting of 34 nodes and 78 edges.

2. **CORA Dataset**: A citation network with 2,708 nodes and 5,429 edges, commonly used for node classification tasks.

3. **CiteSeer Dataset**: Another citation network with 3,327 nodes and 4,732 edges, also used for node classification and link prediction.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with sources for further exploration.

The citations I will extract are:

- For the **Zachary Karate Club Network**, the citation is:
  > Girvan M, Newman M. *Community structure in social and biological networks*. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 2002; 99(12): 7821-7826. doi: 10.1073/pnas.122653799.

- For the **CORA Dataset**, the citation is:
  > McCallum A, Nigam K, Rennie J, Seymore K. *Automating the construction of internet portals with machine learning*. Information Retrieval 2000; 3(2): 127-163. doi: 10.1023/A:1009953814988.

- For the **CiteSeer Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Giles C, Bollacker K, Lawrence S. *CiteSeer: An automatic citation indexing system*. In: Proceedings of the Third ACM Conference on Digital Libraries; 1998. 89-98. doi: 10.1145/276675.276685.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that all relevant details are captured accurately and can be referenced appropriately in future work.
