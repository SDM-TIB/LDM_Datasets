To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Structure-aware Semantic Node Identifiers for Learning on Graphs" by Yuankai Luo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract states that the authors conducted experiments on **34 datasets**, which indicates that multiple datasets are involved. However, I need to find specific names and details.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** and any dedicated **datasets section** (if available) to find explicit mentions of the datasets used. In this paper, the authors mention various tasks such as node classification, graph classification, link prediction, and attributed graph clustering, which suggests that different datasets may be used for each task.

In the **datasets description section**, the authors provide a detailed table (Table 12) summarizing the datasets used in their experiments. Here are the key datasets mentioned:

1. **Cora**: A dataset for node classification with 2,708 nodes and 5,278 edges.
2. **CiteSeer**: Another node classification dataset with 3,327 nodes and 4,732 edges.
3. **PubMed**: A dataset for node classification with 19,717 nodes and 44,324 edges.
4. **NCI1**: A graph classification dataset with 4,110 graphs.
5. **MUTAG**: A graph classification dataset with 188 graphs.
6. **PROTEINS**: A graph classification dataset with 1,113 graphs.
7. **DD**: A graph classification dataset with 1,178 graphs.
8. **COLLAB**: A graph classification dataset with 5,000 graphs.
9. **REDDIT-BINARY**: A graph classification dataset with 2,000 graphs.
10. **IMDB-BINARY**: A graph classification dataset with 1,000 graphs.
11. **ogbn-proteins**: A large-scale graph dataset.
12. **ogbn-arxiv**: Another large-scale graph dataset.
13. **ogbn-products**: A large-scale graph dataset.
14. **pokec**: A social network dataset.

Next, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The paper may not provide explicit citations for all datasets, especially if they are well-known benchmarks, but I will look for any references that are cited alongside the datasets.

For example, the Cora, CiteSeer, and PubMed datasets are commonly referenced in the literature, and I can find their citations in the references section or through a quick search in the literature.

Once I have gathered all the dataset names and their corresponding citations, I will compile them into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and full citation.

Finally, I will ensure that I have accurately represented each dataset's details and citations before finalizing the output.
