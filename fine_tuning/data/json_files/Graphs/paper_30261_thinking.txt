To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Valley-Spin Hall Effect-based Nonvolatile Memory with Exchange-Coupling-Enabled Electrical Isolation of Read and Write Paths" by Karam Cho and Sumeet Kumar Gupta, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, but it may not contain specific dataset information. The introduction often outlines the context and significance of the research, which may include references to datasets used in prior studies.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on experiments or datasets**. In this paper, there may be a section that explicitly discusses the datasets used for simulations or experiments. I will pay close attention to any tables or figures that might summarize the datasets or their characteristics.

If the paper mentions any datasets, I will note their names and descriptions. For example, if the authors refer to specific datasets used for benchmarking or comparisons, I will extract that information.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. I will ensure that I capture all necessary details such as authors, title, publication venue, volume, pages, and year.

If the datasets are not explicitly named in the paper, I will look for any references to previous works that might have introduced those datasets. In such cases, I will cite the original sources of those datasets.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including their descriptions and full citations, into a structured format that can be easily reviewed or processed further. This will ensure that all relevant information is captured and presented clearly.

By following these steps, I will ensure a thorough extraction of datasets from the paper while maintaining proper citation practices.
