To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Graph ARMA Processes from Time-Vertex Spectra" by Eylem Tuğçe Güneyl, Berkay Yaldız, Abdullah Canbolat, and Elif Vural, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study and may mention specific datasets used for experiments or evaluations.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology or experimental results** sections. This is where the authors typically describe the datasets they used, including their characteristics, sizes, and any relevant details about how they were collected or processed.

In this paper, I will specifically look for mentions of datasets such as:

1. **Molène Weather Dataset**: This dataset consists of hourly weather measurements collected from various weather stations in Brittany, France. The authors likely provide details about the number of stations and the time period covered.

2. **COVID-19 Pandemic Dataset**: This dataset includes daily new COVID-19 cases reported across European countries. I will note the time frame and the number of countries involved.

3. **NOAA Weather Dataset**: This dataset contains hourly average temperature measurements from multiple weather stations across the United States. I will check for the number of stations and the time period.

After identifying these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For each dataset, I will compile the following information:
- **Name**: The title or name of the dataset.
- **Description**: A brief description of the dataset, including its purpose and key characteristics.
- **Citation**: The full citation as it appears in the references section of the paper.

Once I have gathered all this information, I will organize it clearly, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I capture all relevant details about the datasets used in the research.
