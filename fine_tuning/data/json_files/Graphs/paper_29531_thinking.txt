To extract datasets from the research paper titled "COIN: Communication-Aware In-Memory Acceleration for Graph Convolutional Networks" by Sumit K. Mandal et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions "experimental evaluations with widely used datasets," which indicates that datasets are indeed discussed. I will look for specific names of datasets in these sections.

Next, I will proceed to the **experiments section** (Section V), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, I will look for any tables or lists that summarize the datasets, as they often provide concise information about each dataset's characteristics.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention several datasets in **Table I**, which includes details such as the type of dataset, number of nodes, edges, features, output labels, and layers. The datasets listed are:

1. **Cora**: A citation network with 2,708 nodes, 10,556 edges, 1,433 features, and 7 output labels.
2. **Citeseer**: Another citation network with 3,327 nodes, 9,228 edges, 3,703 features, and 6 output labels.
3. **Pubmed**: A citation network with 19,717 nodes, 88,651 edges, 500 features, and 2 output labels.
4. **Extended Cora**: A citation network with 19,793 nodes, 130,622 edges, 8,710 features, and 70 output labels.
5. **Nell**: A knowledge graph with 65,755 nodes, 266,144 edges, 5,414 features, and 210 output labels.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The paper cites the following sources for the datasets:

- For **Cora**, the citation is:
  > McCallum, A. K., Nigam, K., Rennie, J., & Seymore, K. (2000). Automating the construction of internet portals with machine learning. *Information Retrieval*, 3(2), 127-163.

- For **Citeseer**, the citation is:
  > Giles, C. L., Bollacker, K. D., & Lawrence, S. (1998). Citeseer: An automatic citation indexing system. In *Proceedings of the third ACM conference on Digital libraries* (pp. 89-98).

- For **Pubmed**, the citation is:
  > Kipf, T. N., & Welling, M. (2016). Semi-supervised classification with graph convolutional networks. *arXiv preprint arXiv:1609.02907*.

- For **Extended Cora**, the citation is:
  > Bojchevski, A., & GÂ¨unnemann, S. (2017). Deep gaussian embedding of graphs: Unsupervised inductive learning via ranking. *arXiv preprint arXiv:1707.03815*.

- For **Nell**, the citation is:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. Each dataset will be described with its characteristics and the corresponding full citation.
