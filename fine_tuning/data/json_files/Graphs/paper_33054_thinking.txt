To extract datasets from the research paper titled "KG-FRUS: a Novel Graph-based Dataset of 127 Years of US Diplomatic Relations" by Gökberk Özsoy et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract introduces the **KG-FRUS dataset**, which is a key focus of the paper, indicating that it is a significant dataset derived from US diplomatic documents.

Next, I will examine **section 1 (Introduction)**, where the authors discuss the creation of the KG-FRUS dataset and its purpose. They mention leveraging the Foreign Relations of the United States (FRUS) corpus, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's foundation.

In **section 3 (KG-FRUS)**, the authors provide detailed information about the dataset, including its structure and the number of documents it encompasses. They state that KG-FRUS is built from **311,604 diplomatic documents** spanning from **1861 to 1988**, which is essential information for describing the dataset.

I will also look for any references to other datasets that may have been used or compared in the paper. The authors mention the **FRUS corpus** as the primary source, which is publicly available and can be cited.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to gather full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. **KG-FRUS Dataset**: The citation for the KG-FRUS dataset is not explicitly provided in the references, but it is derived from the FRUS corpus. Therefore, I will cite the original source of the FRUS dataset:
   > A. Ross, seckroth, J. Wicentowski, V. Kinniburgh, K. Hite, and et al., “Foreign relations of the United States.” https://github.com/HistoryAtState/frus, 2016.

2. **Wikidata**: The authors also mention using Wikidata to enrich the KG-FRUS dataset. The citation for Wikidata is:
   > D. Vrandeˇci´c and M. Krötzsch, “Wikidata: A Free collaborative Knowledgebase,” Commun. ACM, vol. 57, p. 78–85, sep 2014.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

- **KG-FRUS Dataset**: A graph-based dataset created from the FRUS corpus, containing over 311,000 diplomatic documents from 1861 to 1988.
- **FRUS Corpus**: The original dataset from which KG-FRUS is derived, publicly available for research purposes.
- **Wikidata**: Used to enrich the KG-FRUS dataset with additional entities and relations.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the full citations, ensuring that all necessary details are captured for future reference or analysis.
