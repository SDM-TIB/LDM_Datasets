To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Pretraining Respiratory Sound Representations Using Metadata and Contrastive Learning" by Ilyass Moummad and Nicolas Farrugia, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors applied their approach to respiratory sound classification and mentions two datasets: **ICBHI** and **SPRSound**. This is a good starting point.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section**, specifically **section 3.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used in their study. Here, they describe:

1. **ICBHI 2017**: This dataset consists of 5.5 hours of recordings containing 6,898 respiratory cycles, with a breakdown of normal and abnormal breathing sounds. The dataset is noted for its imbalanced class distribution and the variety of recording devices used.

2. **SPRSound**: This is a pediatric respiratory sound database with 2,683 records and 9,089 respiratory sound events from 292 participants. The authors provide a detailed breakdown of the types of respiratory sounds included in this dataset.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and further exploration of the datasets.

The citations I will extract are:

- For **ICBHI 2017**, the citation is:
  > Rocha, B. M., Filos, D., Mendes, L., Serbes, G., Ulukaya, S., Kahya, Y. P., Jakovljevic, N., Turukalo, T. L., Vogiatzis, I. M., Perantoni, E., et al. (2019). An open access database for the evaluation of respiratory sound classification algorithms. *Physiological Measurement*, 40(12), 124003.

- For **SPRSound**, the citation is:
  > Zhang, Q., Zhang, J., Yuan, J., Huang, H., Zhang, Y., Zhang, B., Lv, G., Lin, S., Wang, N., Liu, X., Tang, M., Wang, H., Liu, L., Yuan, S., Zhou, H., Zhao, J., Li, Y., Yin, Y., Zhao, L., Wang, G., & Lian, Y. (2022). SPRSound: Open-source SJTU pediatric respiratory sound database. *IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Circuits and Systems*, 16(5), 867â€“881.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the necessary details for each dataset mentioned in the paper.
