To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Path-aware Siamese Graph Neural Network for Link Prediction" by Jingsong Lv et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant details, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the proposed algorithm is evaluated on two link property prediction datasets, which indicates that datasets are involved. This is a good starting point.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they refer to two datasets:

1. **ogbl-ddi**: This dataset is described as a homogeneous, unweighted, undirected graph representing the drug-drug interaction network, containing 4,267 nodes and 2,135,822 edges.

2. **ogbl-collab**: This dataset is also an undirected graph, representing a subset of collaborations between authors indexed by the Microsoft Academic Graph (MAG). It includes 128-dimensional content embeddings associated with published papers, along with attributes such as the year and edge weight.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The relevant citations are:

- For **ogbl-ddi**, the citation is:
  > Hu, W., Fey, M., Zitnik, M., Dong, Y., Ren, H., Liu, B., Catasta, M., & Leskovec, J. (2020). Open Graph Benchmark: Datasets for Machine Learning on Graphs. *arXiv preprint arXiv:2005.00687*.

- For **ogbl-collab**, the citation is also included in the same reference:
  > Hu, W., Fey, M., Zitnik, M., Dong, Y., Ren, H., Liu, B., Catasta, M., & Leskovec, J. (2020). Open Graph Benchmark: Datasets for Machine Learning on Graphs. *arXiv preprint arXiv:2005.00687*.

Both datasets are part of the Open Graph Benchmark (OGB), which is a well-known resource for graph-based machine learning tasks.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This structured approach will help ensure that I accurately capture all necessary information for downstream processing.
