To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Node Classification in Random Trees" by Wouter W. L. Nuijten and Vlado Menkovski, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions evaluating the proposed method on the **Stanford Sentiment Treebank dataset**, which indicates that this dataset is crucial for the experiments conducted in the paper.

Next, I will look into **section 4 (Evaluation)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset used. In **section 4.1**, they describe the **Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST)** dataset, noting that it consists of fully labeled parse trees of sentences from movie reviews. The dataset includes 11,855 fully labeled sentences, with each node labeled by its sentiment across five categories: very negative, negative, neutral, positive, and very positive. This section confirms that the SST dataset is the primary dataset used for evaluation.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Stanford Sentiment Treebank dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:

- For the **Stanford Sentiment Treebank**, the citation is:
  > Socher, R., Perelygin, A., Wu, J., Chuang, J., Manning, C.D., Ng, A.Y., Potts, C. *Recursive deep models for semantic compositionality over a sentiment treebank*. In Proceedings of the 2013 conference on empirical methods in natural language processing, pp. 1631â€“1642, 2013.

Having gathered all the necessary information, I will summarize the dataset details and prepare to format them according to the required structure. The key dataset extracted is the **Stanford Sentiment Treebank**, and I will ensure to include its full citation in the final output.
