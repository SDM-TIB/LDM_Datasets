To extract datasets from the research paper titled "HiURE: Hierarchical Exemplar Contrastive Learning for Unsupervised Relation Extraction" by Xuming Hu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the experimental results are based on "two public datasets," which indicates that specific datasets will be discussed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experiments)**, where the authors detail the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they specifically mention the following datasets:

1. **NYT+FB Dataset**: This dataset is generated via distant supervision, aligning sentences from the New York Times corpus with Freebase triplets. The authors note that they filtered out sentences with non-binary relations, resulting in 41,685 labeled sentences containing 262 target relations.

2. **TACRED Dataset**: This is a large-scale crowd-sourced relation extraction dataset with 42 relation types and 18,659 relation mentions in the test set. The authors mention that they evaluate their model on this dataset to reflect performance on unseen data.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **NYT+FB Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Evan Sandhaus. *The New York Times Annotated Corpus*. Linguistic Data Consortium, Philadelphia, 6(12):e26752, 2008.

- For the **TACRED Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Zhang, Y., Zhong, V., Chen, D., Angeli, G., & Manning, C. D. (2017). *Position-aware attention and supervised data improve slot filling*. In Proceedings of the EMNLP, pages 35â€“45.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **NYT+FB Dataset**: A dataset generated from the New York Times corpus aligned with Freebase triplets, containing 41,685 labeled sentences and 262 target relations.
2. **TACRED Dataset**: A large-scale crowd-sourced relation extraction dataset with 42 relation types and 18,659 relation mentions in the test set.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly presents each dataset along with its citation, ensuring that all details are accurately captured for future reference or analysis.
