To extract datasets from the research paper titled "LG4AV: Combining Language Models and Graph Neural Networks for Author Verification" by Maximilian Stubbemann and Gerd Stumme, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction typically outlines the context and significance of the work, which may include references to datasets.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of authorship verification and the challenges associated with it, but they do not mention specific datasets. Therefore, I will proceed to the **experiments section**, specifically **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe their methodology and the datasets used for evaluation.

In **section 4.1 (Data Source)**, the authors mention two datasets:

1. **GAI (German AI Researchers Dataset)**: This dataset consists of publication information of German AI researchers, including titles and abstracts sourced from Semantic Scholar and co-authorship relations from DBLP.

2. **KDD Dataset**: This dataset includes authors with publications at the KDD conference, also derived from the international AI researchers dataset.

Next, I will gather more details about these datasets, including how they were prepared and any relevant statistics provided in the paper. In **section 4.2 (Data Preparation)**, the authors describe the process of generating pairs of authors and potential co-authors, which is crucial for understanding the datasets' structure.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. However, since the datasets are derived from existing databases (DBLP and Semantic Scholar), I will cite these sources instead:

- For the **GAI dataset**, the citation is:
  > Koopmann, T., Stubbemann, M., Kapa, M., Paris, M., Buenstorf, G., Hanika, T., Hotho, A., JÃ¤schke, R., & Stumme, G. (2021). Proximity dimensions and the emergence of collaboration: a HypTrails study on German AI research. *Scientometrics*, 1-22.

- For the **KDD dataset**, the citation is:
  > DBLP. (n.d.). DBLP Computer Science Bibliography. Retrieved from https://dblp.org/

After gathering all necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture the datasets used in the research paper.
