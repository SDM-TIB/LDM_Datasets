To extract datasets from the research paper titled "How Expressive are Spectral-Temporal Graph Neural Networks for Time Series Forecasting?" by Ming Jin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract and introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may highlight key datasets used for experiments. 

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology or experiments sections**. In this paper, the authors mention several datasets in the **Experiments** section, specifically in the **Datasets** subsection. 

I will note the following datasets mentioned in the paper:

1. **PeMS03 Dataset**: This dataset is collected from traffic sensors in California, specifically measuring traffic flow. The authors mention that it has a sampling rate of 5 minutes.

2. **PeMS04 Dataset**: Similar to PeMS03, this dataset also comes from traffic sensors and focuses on traffic speed, with the same sampling rate of 5 minutes.

3. **PeMS07 Dataset**: Another dataset from the Caltrans Performance Measurement System, which records traffic flow, with a 5-minute sampling rate.

4. **PeMS08 Dataset**: This dataset records traffic flow as well, with a 5-minute sampling rate.

5. **Electricity Dataset**: This dataset consists of electricity consumption records from 321 customers, with a sampling rate of 1 hour.

6. **Solar-Energy Dataset**: This dataset includes photovoltaic production records from 137 sites in Alabama State, with a sampling rate of 10 minutes.

7. **Weather Dataset**: This dataset consists of records from 21 meteorological stations in Germany, with a sampling rate of 10 minutes.

8. **ECG Dataset**: This dataset includes 5000 records of electrocardiograms, with no specific sampling rate mentioned.

After identifying these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, the citation for the PeMS datasets is typically:
> California Department of Transportation. *Performance Measurement System (PeMS)*. [Online]. Available: https://pems.dot.ca.gov/

For the Electricity dataset, the citation might be:
> "Electricity Consumption Dataset." [Online]. Available: https://github.com/laiguokun/multivariate-time-series-data

For the Solar-Energy dataset, the citation could be:
> "Solar Energy Production Dataset." [Online]. Available: https://github.com/laiguokun/multivariate-time-series-data

For the Weather dataset, the citation might be:
> "Weather Dataset." [Online]. Available: https://github.com/zhouhaoyi/Informer2020

For the ECG dataset, the citation could be:
> "ECG Dataset." [Online]. Available: https://github.com/microsoft/StemGNN/blob/master/dataset/ECG_data.csv

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant datasets from the paper.
