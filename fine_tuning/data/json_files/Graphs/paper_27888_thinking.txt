To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Watching Too Much Television is Good: Self-Supervised Audio-Visual Representation Learning from Movies and TV Shows" by Mahdi M. Kalayeh et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the datasets discussed. The abstract mentions that the authors study the efficacy of learning from movies and TV shows, which suggests that these are the primary datasets of interest.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments** section, particularly in **section 4.1 (Experimental Setup)**. Here, the authors describe their pretraining datasets, which include:

1. **Movie Dataset**: This dataset consists of 3,600 films with an average duration of 105 minutes. It is noted that this dataset comprises 0.7 years' worth of uncurated audiovisual content.

2. **TV Dataset**: This dataset includes 9,200 episodes from a total of 581 shows, with an average duration of 42 minutes per episode. Similar to the movie dataset, it also represents 0.7 years' worth of uncurated audiovisual content.

In the **experiments** section, the authors also mention that they benchmark their model on several datasets for evaluation, including:

- **UCF101**: A dataset for action recognition.
- **HMDB51**: Another dataset for action recognition.
- **ESC50**: A dataset for environmental sound classification.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **UCF101**, the citation is:
  > K. Soomro, A. R. Zamir, and M. Shah. *UCF101: A dataset of 101 human actions classes from videos in the wild*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1212.0402, 2012.

- For **HMDB51**, the citation is:
  > H. Kuehne, H. Jhuang, E. Garrote, T. Poggio, and T. Serre. *HMDB: A large video database for human motion recognition*. In 2011 International Conference on Computer Vision, pages 2556–2563. IEEE, 2011.

- For **ESC50**, the citation is:
  > K. J. Piczak. *ESC: Dataset for environmental sound classification*. In Proceedings of the 23rd ACM international conference on Multimedia, pages 1015–1018, 2015.

Since the Movie and TV datasets are not publicly available due to copyright reasons, they do not have formal citations, but I will note their descriptions as they are critical to the paper's findings.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and citations where applicable. This will ensure that all relevant information is captured for further processing or review.
