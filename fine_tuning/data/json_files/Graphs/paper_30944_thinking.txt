To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MAViC: Multimodal Active Learning for Video Captioning" by Gyanendra Das et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are referenced. The abstract mentions the need for large amounts of annotated video-caption pairs, which suggests that datasets are likely discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will look into the **Related Work** section, where the authors typically discuss previous datasets used in similar research. Here, I notice that they mention several large-scale video captioning datasets, including **MSR-VTT**, **MSVD**, **MPII-MD**, **Charades-STA**, **ANet-Captions**, **LSMDC**, **VATEX**, and **YouCook**. This indicates that these datasets are relevant to their work.

I will then proceed to the **Experiments** section, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. They specifically mention:

1. **MSR-VTT**: This dataset consists of over 7,000 videos and 10,000 clips, with each clip annotated with 20 captions. The authors use the standard splits of 6,500 clips for training and 2,900 clips for testing.

2. **MSVD**: This dataset contains 1,970 clips, each annotated with one caption. The authors use the standard splits of 1,200 for training, 100 for validation, and 670 for testing.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **MSR-VTT**, the citation is:
  > Jun Xu, Tao Mei, Ting Yao, and Yong Rui. *MSR-VTT: A Large Video Description Dataset for Bridging Video and Language*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 5288–5296, 2016.

- For **MSVD**, the citation is:
  > David Chen and William B Dolan. *Collecting Highly Parallel Data for Paraphrase Evaluation*. In Proceedings of the 49th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, pages 190–200, 2011.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations.
