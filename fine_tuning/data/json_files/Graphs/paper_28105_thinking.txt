To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Legislator Representation Learning with Social Context and Expert Knowledge" by Shangbin Feng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract indicates that the authors collected a dataset of political actors by retrieving social context information from Wikipedia and expert knowledge from political think tanks. This suggests that there are specific datasets involved, which I need to identify.

Next, I will examine the **methodology section**, particularly **section 3 (Methodology)**, where the authors describe their data collection process in detail. Here, they mention that they collected data about political actors in the United States from Wikipedia and two political think tanks, AFL-CIO and Heritage Action. This section provides crucial information about the datasets used.

In **subsection 3.1 (Data Collection)**, the authors specify that they retrieved a list of senators and congresspersons from the 114th to the 117th Congress, which amounts to 1,069 social and political entities. They also mention extracting 777 scores from AFL-CIO and 679 scores from Heritage Action, which are used as expert knowledge in their experiments. This indicates that there are at least two datasets to document.

Now, I will compile the details of the datasets:

1. **Political Actors Dataset**: This dataset includes social context information about legislators, which was collected from their Wikipedia pages. It consists of 1,069 entities, including senators, congresspersons, governors, and other political figures.

2. **Expert Knowledge Scores**: This dataset includes scores from two political think tanks:
   - **AFL-CIO Scores**: 777 scores indicating the political leanings of various legislators.
   - **Heritage Action Scores**: 679 scores indicating the political leanings of various legislators.

Next, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper does not provide specific citations for the datasets themselves, but I can infer the sources based on the information provided:

- For the **Political Actors Dataset**, the citation can be attributed to the Wikipedia pages of the political actors, which are publicly accessible.
- For the **AFL-CIO Scores**, the citation is:
  > AFL-CIO. *Legislator Scoreboard*. Available at: https://aflcio.org/
  
- For the **Heritage Action Scores**, the citation is:
  > Heritage Action. *Legislator Scoreboard*. Available at: https://heritageaction.com/

Finally, I will summarize the datasets with their respective citations, ensuring that I provide a clear and concise description of each dataset along with its source.

After completing this process, I will have a well-documented list of datasets extracted from the paper, ready for further analysis or use in related research.
