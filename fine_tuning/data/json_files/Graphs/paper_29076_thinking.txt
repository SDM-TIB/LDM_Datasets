To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MERIt: Meta-Path Guided Contrastive Learning for Logical Reasoning" by Fangkai Jiao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper, as these sections typically contain references to datasets used in the research. In the abstract, the authors mention evaluating their method on **two challenging logical reasoning benchmarks**, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors explicitly name the datasets: **ReClor** and **LogiQA**. They describe these datasets as benchmarks for logical reasoning tasks, indicating their significance in the experiments conducted.

I will then look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this case, the authors provide details about both datasets, including their origins and characteristics. 

1. **ReClor Dataset**: This dataset is extracted from logical reasoning questions of standardized graduate admission examinations. It is noted that the held-out test set is further divided into EASY and HARD subsets, referred to as test-E and test-H, respectively.

2. **LogiQA Dataset**: This dataset consists of 8,678 multiple-choice questions collected from National Civil Servants Examinations of China, which have been manually translated into English. The dataset is split into training, development, and test sets.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **ReClor**, the citation is:
  > Weihao Yu, Zihang Jiang, Yanfei Dong, and Jiashi Feng. *ReClor: A Reading Comprehension Dataset Requiring Logical Reasoning*. In ICLR, 2020.

- For **LogiQA**, the citation is:
  > Jian Liu, Leyang Cui, Hanmeng Liu, Dandan Huang, Yile Wang, and Yue Zhang. *LogiQA: A Challenge Dataset for Machine Reading Comprehension with Logical Reasoning*. In IJCAI, pages 3622â€“3628, 2020.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will prepare to format this information according to the required structure for further processing or review.
