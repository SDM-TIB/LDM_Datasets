To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multitask Learning On Graph Neural Networks Applied To Molecular Property Predictions" by Fabio Capela et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention the need for predictive models for physico-chemical properties and refer to the use of various datasets. However, I need to look for specific dataset names and details.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets and experimental settings)**, where the authors list the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention several datasets along with the number of molecules in each:

1. **ESOL**: 1,128 molecules, which contains experimental values of water solubility.
2. **FreeSolv**: 613 molecules, which contains experimental values for hydration free energy.
3. **logD7.4**: 4,200 molecules, corresponding to the octanol-water distribution coefficient at pH 7.4.
4. **Boiling Point (BP)**: 5,435 molecules, which includes boiling point data.
5. **LogVP**: 2,708 molecules, which refers to vapor pressure data.
6. **LogP**: 13,973 molecules, which is the octanol-water partition coefficient.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The citations I will extract are:

- For **ESOL**:
  > John S. Delaney. *Esol: Estimating aqueous solubility directly from molecular structure*. Journal of Chemical Information and Computer Sciences, 44(3):1000â€“1005, 2004.

- For **FreeSolv**:
  > David Mobley and J. Guthrie. *Freesolv: A database of experimental and calculated hydration free energies, with input files*. Journal of Computer-Aided Molecular Design, 28, 06 2014.

- For **logD7.4**:
  > A. Hersey. *ChEMBL deposited data set - AZ_dataset*. 2015.

- For **Boiling Point (BP)**, **LogVP**, and **LogP**, I will refer to the relevant citations provided in the references section, ensuring I capture the correct details.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented and properly cited. This structured approach will help maintain clarity and ensure that all relevant datasets are documented correctly.
