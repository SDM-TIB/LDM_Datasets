To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fine-Grained Urban Flow Inference with Dynamic Multi-scale Representation Learning" by Shilu Yuan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors validate their model through experiments on **three real-world datasets**, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will look closely at **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors discuss the datasets used for their experiments. They mention three datasets: **TaxiBJ**, **BikeNYC**, and **DiDi-Xi’an**. I will gather details about each dataset, including their characteristics and any relevant statistics provided in the text.

In the experiments section, the authors provide a brief overview of the datasets:
1. **TaxiBJ**: A large dataset from Beijing used for urban flow inference.
2. **BikeNYC**: A smaller dataset from New York City, also utilized for urban flow analysis.
3. **DiDi-Xi’an**: Another smaller dataset from Xi’an, China, used in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations may not be explicitly listed as datasets but could be referenced in the context of the studies or data collection methods used.

After reviewing the references, I find the following citations related to the datasets:
- For **TaxiBJ**, the citation is:
  > Zhang, J., Zheng, Y., Qi, D. *Deep spatio-temporal residual networks for citywide crowd flows prediction*. In Proceedings of the AAAI conference on artificial intelligence, vol. 31, 2017.

- For **BikeNYC**, the citation is:
  > Ouyang, K., Liang, Y., Liu, Y., Tong, Z., Ruan, S., Zheng, Y., Rosenblum, D.S. *Fine-grained urban flow inference*. IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering, 34(6), 2755–2770, 2020.

- For **DiDi-Xi’an**, the citation is:
  > Li, X., Gong, Y., Liu, W., Yin, Y., Zheng, Y., Nie, L. *Dual-track spatio-temporal learning for urban flow prediction with adaptive normalization*. Artificial Intelligence, 328, 104065, 2024.

With this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
