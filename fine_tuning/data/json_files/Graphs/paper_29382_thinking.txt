To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Spatially-Preserving Flattening for Location-Aware Classification of Findings in Chest X-Rays" by Neha Srivathsa et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors present results on a "large multi-hospital chest X-ray dataset," which suggests that a specific dataset is being utilized.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **introduction**. Here, the authors refer to "large open source datasets labeled for selected anomalies" and cite references [1] and [2]. This indicates that these references likely contain information about the datasets used.

In **section 3 (Classification of Location-Specific Findings in Chest X-Rays)**, the authors explicitly mention two datasets: **MIMIC-CXR** and **NIH Chest X-ray Dataset**. They describe the MIMIC-CXR dataset as a multi-institutional dataset collected from two reference sources, which is crucial for understanding the context of their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for these datasets:

1. For **MIMIC-CXR**, the citation is:
   > A. E. W. Johnson, T. J. Pollard, N. R. Greenbaum, M. P. Lungren, C-Y Deng, Y. Peng, Z. Lu, R. G. Mark, S. J. Berkowitz, and S. Horng, "MIMIC-CXR, a large publicly available database of labeled chest radiographs," https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.07042v5, 1 2019.

2. For **NIH Chest X-ray Dataset**, the citation is:
   > Xiaosong Wang, Yifan Peng, Le Lu, Zhiyong Lu, Mohammadhadi Bagheri, and Ronald Summers, "ChestX-ray8: Hospital-scale chest x-ray database and benchmarks on weakly-supervised classification and localization of common thorax diseases," in Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2017, pp. 3462â€“3471.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and that the full citations are included. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, which is essential for reproducibility and further research in the field.
