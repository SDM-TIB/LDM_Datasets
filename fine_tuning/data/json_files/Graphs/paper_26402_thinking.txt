To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Graph Matching Consensus" by Matthias Fey et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the practical effectiveness of the method on real-world tasks, which suggests that datasets are likely involved. The introduction elaborates on the applications of graph matching, but I need to look for specific dataset names.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section 4) closely, as this is where datasets are typically detailed. In Section 4.1, the authors mention conducting experiments on synthetic graphs, but I need to confirm if they refer to any specific datasets. 

In Section 4.2, the authors describe their experiments on the **PASCALVOC** dataset, which contains labeled keypoint locations. They provide details about the training and testing splits, which indicates that this dataset is crucial for their experiments.

In Section 4.3, they mention the **PASCALPF** dataset, which consists of image pairs for geometric feature matching. This dataset is also essential for their evaluation.

In Section 4.4, the authors discuss the **DBP15K** dataset, which links entities across different languages in knowledge graphs. This dataset is significant for their semi-supervised cross-lingual knowledge graph alignment experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

1. **PASCALVOC Dataset**:
   > Everingham, M., Van Gool, L., Williams, C. K. I., Winn, J., & Zisserman, A. (2010). The Pascal visual object classes (VOC) challenge. In *International Journal of Computer Vision (IJCV)*.

2. **PASCALPF Dataset**:
   > Ham, B., Cho, M., Schmid, C., & Ponce, J. (2016). Proposal flow. In *CVPR*.

3. **DBP15K Dataset**:
   > Sun, Z., Hu, W., & Li, C. (2017). Cross-lingual entity alignment via joint attribute-preserving embedding. In *ISWC*.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and cited according to the requirements. This will include the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation for each dataset used in the experiments of the paper.
