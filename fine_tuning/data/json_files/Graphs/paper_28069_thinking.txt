To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Spot What Matters: Learning Context Using Graph Convolutional Networks for Weakly-Supervised Action Detection" by Michail Tsiaousis et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions evaluating the model on the **DALY dataset**, which indicates that this dataset is crucial for the research.

Next, I will look into **section 4.1 (Dataset and Evaluation Metric)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the DALY dataset. They state that the DALY dataset consists of 510 videos of 10 human actions, such as "Drinking," "Phoning," and "Brushing Teeth." This section confirms that DALY is the primary dataset used for their experiments.

In the same section, the authors also mention that the dataset is annotated based on sparse spatial supervision, which is relevant for understanding how the dataset is utilized in their weakly-supervised action detection approach.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the DALY dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:
> Weinzaepfel, P., Martin, X., & Schmid, C. (2016). *Towards weakly-supervised action localization*. ArXiv abs/1605.05197.

This citation is essential for properly referencing the dataset in any subsequent work.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry for the DALY dataset, ensuring to include the full citation as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the dataset used in the research paper.
