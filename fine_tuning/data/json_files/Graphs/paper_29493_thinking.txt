To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Data Augmentation with Paraphrase Generation and Entity Extraction for Multimodal Dialogue System" by Eda Okur et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the focus on improving the Natural Language Understanding (NLU) module with limited datasets, which suggests that specific datasets may be referenced later in the paper.

Next, I will look for explicit mentions of datasets in the **experiments and results sections**. In section 6.1, the authors describe their experiments on the **KidSpace NLU datasets**, which are specifically designed for multimodal math learning experiences. They mention two datasets: the **Planting Flowers dataset** and the **Watering Flowers dataset**. 

1. **Planting Flowers Dataset**: This dataset contains 1,927 utterances specifically designed for the Flowerpot game, which focuses on teaching math concepts to children aged 5 to 8.

2. **Watering Flowers Dataset**: This dataset includes 2,115 utterances for the NumberGrid activity, also aimed at the same age group.

In section 6.1, the authors provide statistics about these datasets, such as the number of distinct intents and samples, which further confirms their significance in the study.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. However, since these datasets are likely created by the authors for their specific research, they may not have external citations. Instead, I will note the authors' own reference to the datasets:

- For the **Planting Flowers dataset** and **Watering Flowers dataset**, the citation is:
  > Okur, E., Sahay, S., and Nachman, L. (2021). *KidSpace NLU Datasets*. In Proceedings of the Second Workshop on Data Science with Human in the Loop: Language Advances, pages 31â€“40, Online, June. Association for Computational Linguistics.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets and their citations in a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its citation for future reference.
