To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SimCKP: Simple Contrastive Learning of Keyphrase Representations" by Minseok Choi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to find any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that "Experimental results on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach," which indicates that datasets are used but does not specify which ones.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for evaluation. They mention five scientific article datasets: **Inspec**, **Krapivin**, **NUS**, **SemEval**, and **KP20k**. Each dataset is likely to have specific characteristics and citations associated with it.

I will then look for detailed descriptions of these datasets within the same section. The authors provide a table (Table 1) that includes statistics about each dataset, such as the average number of keyphrases and the number of samples, which helps in understanding the context of each dataset.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. Based on the information provided in the paper, I will compile the citations as follows:

1. **Inspec Dataset**: 
   > Hulth, A. (2003). Improved automatic keyword extraction given more linguistic knowledge. In Proceedings of the 2003 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (pp. 216-223).

2. **Krapivin Dataset**: 
   > Krapivin, M., Autaeu, A., & Marchese, M. (2009). Large dataset for keyphrase extraction. In Proceedings of the 2009 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (pp. 1318-1327).

3. **NUS Dataset**: 
   > Nguyen, D. Q., & Kan, M. Y. (2007). Keyphrase extraction in scientific publications. In Asian Digital Libraries. Looking Back 10 Years and Forging New Frontiers (pp. 317-326).

4. **SemEval Dataset**: 
   > Kim, S. N., Medelyan, O., Kan, M. Y., & Baldwin, T. (2010). SemEval-2010 task 5: Automatic keyphrase extraction from scientific articles. In Proceedings of the 5th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (pp. 21-26).

5. **KP20k Dataset**: 
   > Meng, R., Yuan, X., Zhao, S., Trischler, A., & He, D. (2017). Deep keyphrase generation. In Proceedings of the 55th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (pp. 582-592).

After gathering the dataset names and their corresponding citations, I will ensure that each dataset is documented clearly, emphasizing the importance of proper citation for academic integrity and reproducibility.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that can be easily reviewed or processed further.
