To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Bias Reduction via Cooperative Bargaining in Synthetic Graph Dataset Generation" by Axel Wassington and Sergi Abadal, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the generation of synthetic graph datasets to overcome selection bias, which indicates that datasets are a central theme of the paper. I will look for specific names of datasets mentioned in these sections.

Next, I will examine the **methodology** and **results** sections, as these typically provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the experiments. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, characteristics, and how they were utilized in the study.

In the **results section**, the authors discuss the validation of their method against a set of real graphs from the SparseMatrix collection. This suggests that there are specific datasets used for validation, which I need to identify.

I will also check the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. This is crucial for providing proper attribution and context for each dataset.

From my reading, I identify the following datasets:

1. **Open Graph Benchmark (OGB)**: This dataset is mentioned as a standard for benchmarking graph processing techniques. The citation for OGB is:
   > Hu, W., Fey, M., Zitnik, M., Dong, Y., Ren, H., Liu, B., Catasta, M., & Leskovec, J. (2020). *Open graph benchmark: Datasets for machine learning on graphs*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2005.00687.

2. **SparseMatrix Collection**: This collection is used for validation in the study. The citation for this collection is:
   > Kolodziej, S. P., Aznaveh, M., Bullock, M., David, J., Davis, T. A., Henderson, M., Hu, Y., & Sandstrom, R. (2019). *The SuiteSparse Matrix Collection website interface*. Journal of Open Source Software, 4(35), 1244. https://doi.org/10.21105/joss.01244.

3. **Baseline Dataset**: The authors describe a naive baseline dataset generated using the RMAT model. While this dataset may not have a formal citation, it is important to note its significance in the study.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
