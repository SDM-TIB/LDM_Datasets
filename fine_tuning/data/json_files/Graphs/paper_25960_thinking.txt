To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Splenomegaly Segmentation on Multi-modal MRI using Deep Convolutional Networks" by Yuankai Huo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the study involves a cohort of clinically acquired MRI scans, which suggests that a dataset is being utilized.

Next, I will examine the **Methods** section, specifically **section IV (Data and Platform)**, where the authors describe the dataset in detail. Here, they mention that they used **60 clinically acquired whole abdominal MRI scans** from **27 unique patients**. This is a clear indication of the dataset being used for their experiments.

I will note the specifics of the dataset:
- The dataset consists of **32 T1-weighted (T1w)** and **28 T2-weighted (T2w)** MRI scans.
- The scans were collected from patients with splenomegaly, and the authors provide details about the number of scans per patient.

Next, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. However, since the dataset is based on clinical scans and not a publicly available dataset, there may not be a formal citation. Instead, I will summarize the dataset's details as follows:

1. **Dataset Name**: Clinically Acquired MRI Scans for Splenomegaly Segmentation
   - **Description**: This dataset consists of 60 MRI scans (32 T1w and 28 T2w) from 27 unique patients diagnosed with splenomegaly. The scans were used for training and evaluating the proposed segmentation methods.
   - **Citation**: Not applicable (dataset is based on clinical data and not publicly available).

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry in a structured format, ensuring that I include all relevant details and the citation (or lack thereof) as necessary. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the dataset used in the study.
