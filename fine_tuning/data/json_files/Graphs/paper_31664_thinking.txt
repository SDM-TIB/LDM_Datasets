To extract datasets from the research paper titled "D2CSE: Difference-aware Deep continuous prompts for Contrastive Sentence Embeddings" by Hyunjae Lee, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions evaluating D2CSE on **seven Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) benchmarks**, which indicates that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the author discusses the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, it is stated that the authors used **1M randomly sampled sentences from Wikipedia and NLI**, including the **SNLI** and **MNLI** datasets for both unsupervised and supervised settings. This is a clear indication of the datasets utilized in the experiments.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets mentioned are as follows:

- For the **SNLI dataset**, the citation is:
  > Bowman SR, Angeli G, Potts C, Manning CD. *A large annotated corpus for learning natural language inference*. In: Proceedings of the 2015 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, Association for Computational Linguistics, Lisbon, Portugal, pp 632–642, 2015. DOI: 10.18653/v1/D15-1075.

- For the **MNLI dataset**, the citation is:
  > Williams A, Nangia N, Bowman S. *A broad-coverage challenge corpus for sentence understanding through inference*. In: Proceedings of the 2018 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, Volume 1 (Long Papers), Association for Computational Linguistics, New Orleans, Louisiana, pp 1112–1122, 2018. DOI: 10.18653/v1/N18-1101.

- For the **Wikipedia dataset**, while it is commonly used and does not have a specific citation, it is generally referenced as:
  > Wikipedia contributors. *Wikipedia, The Free Encyclopedia*. Available at: https://www.wikipedia.org/.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This includes ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation.
