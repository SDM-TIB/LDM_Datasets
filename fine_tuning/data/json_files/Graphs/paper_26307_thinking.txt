To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Composition-Based Multi-Relational Graph Convolutional Networks" by Shikhar Vashishth et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to look for any mentions of datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions and may mention datasets used for evaluation. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets in relation to the research.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically looking for subsections that detail the datasets used for various tasks. In this paper, the authors mention using datasets for link prediction, node classification, and graph classification tasks. I will look for explicit mentions of dataset names and descriptions.

In the **experimental setup section**, the authors provide a summary of the datasets used:

1. **FB15k-237**: This dataset is a pruned version of FB15k, which is used for link prediction tasks. It contains 14,541 entities and 310,116 edges, with 237 relations.

2. **WN18RR**: Similar to FB15k-237, this dataset is derived from WordNet and is also used for link prediction. It contains 40,943 entities and 93,003 edges, with 11 relations.

3. **MUTAG (Node)**: This dataset is used for node classification and contains relationships between complex molecules, with the task of identifying whether a molecule is carcinogenic or not.

4. **AM**: This dataset contains relationships between different artifacts in the Amsterdam Museum, with the goal of predicting the category of a given artifact based on its links and attributes.

5. **MUTAG (Graph)**: This dataset is used for graph classification and consists of 188 mutagenic aromatic and nitro compounds, categorized based on their mutagenic effects.

6. **PTC**: This dataset consists of chemical compounds indicating carcinogenicity in male and female rats, used for graph classification.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations of the datasets mentioned. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or analysis.
