To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Semi-Supervised Few-Shot Intent Classification and Slot Filling" by Samyadeep Basu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** sections to get an overview of the datasets used. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments across standard intent classification (IC) and slot filling (SF) benchmarks, specifically naming **SNIPS** and **ATIS** as the datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** to confirm the details about these datasets. In the experiments section, the authors explicitly state that they used **SNIPS** and **ATIS** for their evaluations. This confirms that these are the datasets utilized in their research.

Now, I will gather more information about each dataset from the paper. The authors describe **SNIPS** as a challenging dataset containing intents from diverse domains, while **ATIS** is noted for being imbalanced and focused solely on the Airline domain. This contextual information is important for understanding the datasets' characteristics.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For the **SNIPS dataset**, the citation is:
  > Alice Coucke, Alaa Saade, Adrien Ball, Théodore Bluche, Alexandre Caulier, David Leroy, Clément Doumouro, Thibault Gisselbrecht, Francesco Caltagirone, Thibaut Lavril, Maël Primet, and Joseph Dureau. *Snips voice platform: an embedded spoken language understanding system for private-by-design voice interfaces*. In Proceedings of the 2018 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 1–6, 2018.

- For the **ATIS dataset**, the citation is:
  > Charles T. Hemphill, John J. Godfrey, and George R. Doddington. *The ATIS spoken language systems pilot corpus*. In Speech and Natural Language: Proceedings of a Workshop Held at Hidden Valley, Pennsylvania, June 24-27, 1990.

With this information, I can now summarize the datasets in a structured manner, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
