To extract datasets from the research paper titled "GenEM: Physics-Informed Generative Cryo-Electron Microscopy" by Jiakai Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the need for high-quality annotated datasets for cryo-EM, indicating that datasets are likely to be a focus of the research.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In the introduction, the authors mention that their method can enhance particle picking and pose estimation models, which suggests that they have used specific datasets for evaluation.

Upon reviewing the **experiments section**, I find that the authors evaluate their method on three specific cryo-EM datasets:

1. **T20S Proteasome (EMPIAR-10025)**: This dataset contains 196 images and 49,954 annotated particles. It is noted for its high density of particles, which poses challenges for particle picking.

2. **80S Ribosome (EMPIAR-10028)**: This dataset includes 1,081 images with 105,417 annotated particles. The complexity of the particles in this dataset makes pose estimation difficult.

3. **Asymmetric αVβ8 Integrin (EMPIAR-10345)**: This dataset consists of 1,644 micrographs and 84,266 annotated particles, featuring varied conformations that require advanced processing for heterogeneous reconstruction.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The EMPIAR datasets are typically cited with their respective identifiers and relevant publications. 

The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **T20S Proteasome (EMPIAR-10025)**, the citation is:
  > Melody G. Campbell, David Veesler, Anchi Cheng, Clinton S. Potter, and Bridget Carragher. *2.8 Å resolution reconstruction of the thermoplasma acidophilum 20S proteasome using cryo-electron microscopy*. eLife, 4, 2015.

- For **80S Ribosome (EMPIAR-10028)**, the citation is:
  > Wilson W. Wong, Xiaochen Bai, Alan Brown, Israel S. Fernández, Eric Hanssen, Melanie M. Condron, Yan Hong Tan, Jake Baum, and Sjors H. W. Scheres. *Cryo-EM structure of the plasmodium falciparum 80S ribosome bound to the anti-protozoan drug emetine*. eLife, 3, 2014.

- For **Asymmetric αVβ8 Integrin (EMPIAR-10345)**, the citation is:
  > Melody G. Campbell, Anthony Cormier, Saburo Ito, Robert I Seed, and Stephen L. Nishimura. *Cryo-EM reveals integrin-mediated TGF-β activation without release from latent TGF-β*. Cell, 180:490–501.e16, 2020.

With these citations in hand, I can now summarize the datasets extracted from the paper, ensuring to include the full citations as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research.
