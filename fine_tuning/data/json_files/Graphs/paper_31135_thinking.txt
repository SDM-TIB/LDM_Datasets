To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Pyramid Self-attention Polymerization Learning for Semi-supervised Skeleton-based Action Recognition" by Binqian Xu and Xiangbo Shu, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that experiments were conducted on the **NTU RGB+D** and **Northwestern-UCLA** datasets, which suggests that these are the datasets I need to focus on.

Next, I will look for detailed descriptions of these datasets in the **experiments section**. In section 4.1, the authors provide specific information about both datasets:

1. **NTU RGB+D Dataset**: This dataset contains 56,578 skeleton sequences covering 60 action classes, collected from 40 individuals using three camera views. Each sequence includes multiple frames with 3D coordinates of 25 skeleton joints. The authors also mention the use of two benchmarks: Cross-Subject and Cross-View.

2. **Northwestern-UCLA Dataset**: This dataset consists of 1,494 skeleton sequences across 10 classes, collected from 10 individuals using three camera views. Each sequence represents a human body with 20 joints.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **NTU RGB+D Dataset**, the citation is:
  > A. Shahroudy, J. Liu, T.-T. Ng, and G. Wang. "NTU RGB+D: A Large Scale Dataset for 3D Human Activity Analysis." In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 1010–1019, 2016.

- For the **Northwestern-UCLA Dataset**, the citation is:
  > J. Wang, X. Nie, Y. Xia, Y. Wu, and S.-C. Zhu. "Cross-view Action Modeling, Learning and Recognition." In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 2649–2656, 2014.

With this information, I can now summarize the datasets extracted from the paper, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.
