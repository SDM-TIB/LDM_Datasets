To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Contrastive Representation Learning for Cross-Document Coreference Resolution of Events and Entities" by Benjamin Hsu and Graham Horwood, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions achieving state-of-the-art results on the **ECB+ corpus**, which indicates that this dataset is likely central to the research.

Next, I will look closely at the **introduction** where the authors discuss the challenges of coreference resolution and mention the **ECB+ corpus** as a benchmark dataset. This section provides context for the dataset's relevance to their work.

In the **methodology section**, specifically section 3.1, the authors describe their use of the **ECB+ corpus** in detail. They explain how they follow the setup of Cybulska and Vossen (2015) and specify the topics used for training, development, and testing. This section confirms that the ECB+ corpus is indeed the dataset utilized for their experiments.

I will also check the **results section** to see if there are any additional datasets mentioned or if the authors provide further details about the ECB+ corpus. However, it appears that the ECB+ corpus is the primary dataset referenced throughout the paper.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citation for the ECB+ corpus. The citation is as follows:
> Agata Cybulska and Piek Vossen. *Using a sledgehammer to crack a nut? lexical diversity and event coreference resolution*. In LREC, 2014.

With this information, I will summarize the dataset details:

1. **ECB+ Corpus**: This dataset is an extension of the Event Coreference Bank (ECB) and consists of documents from Google News clustered into topics and annotated for event coreference. It is used extensively in the paper for evaluating the proposed method.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format for further processing.
