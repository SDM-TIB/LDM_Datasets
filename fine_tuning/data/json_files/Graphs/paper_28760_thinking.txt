To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Looking Beyond Corners: Contrastive Learning of Visual Representations for Keypoint Detection and Description Extraction" by Henrique Siqueira et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the development of a keypoint detection method but does not explicitly mention datasets. Therefore, I will look for specific references to datasets in the introduction and experiments sections.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention the importance of keypoint detection and description extraction but do not specify any datasets. However, they reference the use of deep learning and self-supervised methods, which often rely on specific datasets for training and evaluation.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** closely, particularly the subsections that detail the evaluation metrics and implementation details. Here, the authors mention using the **MS-COCO dataset** for training and the **HPatches dataset** for testing. This is crucial information as it identifies the datasets used in their experiments.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **MS-COCO dataset**, the citation is:
   > T.-Y. Lin, M. Maire, S. Belongie, J. Hays, P. Perona, D. Ramanan, P. Dollár, and C. L. Zitnick. *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. In ECCV. Springer, 2014, pp. 740–755.

2. For the **HPatches dataset**, the citation is:
   > V. Balntas, K. Lenc, A. Vedaldi, and K. Mikolajczyk. *HPatches: A Benchmark and Evaluation of Handcrafted and Learned Local Descriptors*. In Proc. of the IEEE/CVF CVPR, 2017, pp. 5173–5182.

Having identified the datasets and their citations, I will now compile this information into a structured format for further processing. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their respective citations.
