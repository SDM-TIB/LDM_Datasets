To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Resource Allocation via Graph Neural Networks in Free Space Optical Fronthaul Networks" by Zhan Gao et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides an overview of the research focus, but I need to look for specific datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (which may also be labeled as results or evaluation) to find any explicit mentions of datasets. This section typically contains details about the datasets used for simulations or evaluations, including their characteristics and how they were utilized in the study.

In this paper, the authors discuss numerical simulations but do not explicitly mention any publicly available datasets. Instead, they refer to using system models from previous works to compute channel state information (CSI) and channel capacities. This suggests that the authors may not have used a traditional dataset but rather generated data based on theoretical models.

Since there are no specific datasets mentioned, I will check the **References section** for any cited works that may contain relevant datasets or models. This could include papers that describe the system models or simulations used in their experiments.

After reviewing the references, I will compile any relevant citations that could be associated with datasets or models used in the research. If the authors have referenced specific datasets or models in their citations, I will ensure to note those down with full citations.

Finally, I will summarize my findings, including any relevant citations, and prepare to present them in the required format. If no datasets are explicitly mentioned, I will note that as well, indicating that the research relies on theoretical models rather than empirical datasets.

In conclusion, I will ensure to document any findings related to datasets, including full citations for any referenced works that may provide context or data relevant to the research conducted in this paper.
