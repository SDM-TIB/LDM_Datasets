To extract datasets from the research paper titled "End-to-End AI-Based MRI Reconstruction and Lesion Detection Pipeline for Evaluation of Deep Learning Image Reconstruction" by Ruiyang Zhao et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the use of a "fastMRI dataset" and "fastMRI+ dataset," which indicates that these datasets are relevant to the study.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors discuss the importance of large MRI datasets for deep learning techniques. They specifically mention the "fastMRI dataset" and the "fastMRI+ dataset" as key resources for their research.

In the **methods section**, the authors provide more details about the datasets. They state that the YOLO detection network was trained on fully-sampled knee MR images obtained from the fastMRI public dataset and the fastMRI+ clinical annotations. This confirms the datasets' relevance and provides context for their use in the study.

I will also check the **results section** to see if there are any additional details or insights about the datasets used in the experiments. The authors discuss the performance of the detection network and how it relates to the datasets, reinforcing the importance of the fastMRI datasets in their findings.

Now, I will look at the **references section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. For the **fastMRI dataset**, the citation is:
   > Jure Zbontar, Florian Knoll, Anuroop Sriram, Tullie Murrell, Zhengnan Huang, Matthew J Muckley, Aaron Defazio, Ruben Stern, Patricia Johnson, Mary Bruno, et al. "fastMRI: An open dataset and benchmarks for accelerated MRI." arXiv preprint arXiv:1811.08839, 2018.

2. For the **fastMRI+ dataset**, the citation is:
   > Ruiyang Zhao, Burhaneddin Yaman, Yuxin Zhang, Russell Stewart, Austin Dixon, Florian Knoll, Zhengnan Huang, Yvonne W. Lui, Michael S. Hansen, and Matthew P. Lungren. "fastMRI+: Clinical pathology annotations for knee and brain fully sampled multi-coil MRI data." arXiv preprint arXiv:2109.03812, 2021.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets:

- **fastMRI dataset**: A public dataset for accelerated MRI, used for training the YOLO detection network.
- **fastMRI+ dataset**: An extension of the fastMRI dataset that includes clinical pathology annotations, also used in the study.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
