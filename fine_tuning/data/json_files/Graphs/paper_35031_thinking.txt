To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Lifelong Graph Summarization with Neural Networks" by Jonatan Frank et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the use of "ten weekly snapshots of a web graph with over 100M edges, sampled in 2012 and 2022." This indicates that there are datasets related to these snapshots, which I need to identify.

Next, I will look for specific sections that discuss datasets in detail. The **experimental apparatus** section (Section 4) is likely to contain valuable information about the datasets used in the experiments. In **Section 4.1**, the authors explicitly mention the **DyLDO dataset**, which consists of weekly snapshots of the web. They describe how the dataset was created, including the timeframes of the snapshots used for their experiments.

In Section 4.1, the authors provide the following details about the DyLDO dataset:
- The dataset includes snapshots from **6 May 2012 to 8 July 2012** and from **25 September 2022 to 27 November 2022**.
- The dataset is based on a sampling process starting from a seed list of about 90,000 URIs.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the DyLDO dataset. The relevant citation is:
> Tobias Käfer, Jürgen Umbrich, Aidan Hogan, and Axel Polleres. *DyLDO: Towards a Dynamic Linked Data Observatory*. In WWW2012 Workshop on Linked Data on the Web, Lyon, France, 16 April, 2012. [Link](http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-937/ldow2012-paper-14.pdf).

Since the DyLDO dataset is the primary dataset mentioned in the paper, I will summarize it as follows:

1. **DyLDO Dataset**: This dataset consists of weekly snapshots of the web, created from a seed list of approximately 90,000 URIs. The snapshots used in the experiments span from May 6, 2012, to November 27, 2022.

Finally, I will compile the extracted information into a structured format for review or further processing, ensuring that I include the full citation for the dataset as required.
