To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Beyond Visual Cues: Synchronously Exploring Target-Centric Semantics for Vision-Language Tracking" by Jiawei Ge et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the effectiveness of the proposed method on VL tracking datasets, which suggests that specific datasets are likely referenced.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any explicit mentions of datasets. The authors discuss the challenges of single object tracking and the need for incorporating high-level semantics, which may lead to references to specific datasets used for evaluation.

In the **experiments section**, I will look for a subsection that details the datasets used for training and evaluation. The authors mention evaluating their approach on popular benchmarks specifically designed for VL tracking, such as **TNL2K**, **OTB99**, and **LaSOT**. I will note down the details provided for each dataset.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the **References section** of the paper:

1. **TNL2K**: The citation is:
   > Xiao Wang, Xiujun Shu, Zhipeng Zhang, Bo Jiang, Yaowei Wang, Yonghong Tian, and Feng Wu. *Towards more flexible and accurate object tracking with natural language: Algorithms and benchmark*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 13763–13773, 2021.

2. **OTB99**: The citation is:
   > Zhenyang Li, Ran Tao, Efstratios Gavves, Cees GM Snoek, and Arnold WM Smeulders. *Tracking by natural language specification*. In Proceedings of the IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pages 6495–6503, 2017.

3. **LaSOT**: The citation is:
   > Heng Fan, Liting Lin, Fan Yang, Peng Chu, Ge Deng, Sijia Yu, Hexin Bai, Yong Xu, Chunyuan Liao, and Haibin Ling. *LaSOT: A high-quality benchmark for large-scale single object tracking*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pages 5374–5383, 2019.

After collecting the dataset names and their citations, I will summarize the information for each dataset, ensuring to include the full citation as it is crucial for proper referencing.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that can be used for further processing or review.
