To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Compressing Local Descriptor Models for Mobile Applications" by Roy Miles and Krystian Mikolajczyk, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to find any references to datasets. The abstract mentions improvements in feature-based image matching through the use of large datasets, which suggests that datasets are involved, but I need to find specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental results section** (section 4), where the authors evaluate their methods. In this section, they mention using the **HPatches benchmark** for evaluating the task performance of descriptor models. This is a clear indication of a dataset being utilized.

I will then look for any additional datasets mentioned in the paper. The authors also refer to the **Liberty, Yosemite, and Notre-Dame datasets** in the context of training the HardNet++ weights. This indicates that these datasets are also relevant to their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

1. **HPatches Benchmark**: The citation is:
   > V. Balntas, K. Lenc, A. Vedaldi, and K. Mikolajczyk. *HPatches: A benchmark and evaluation of handcrafted and learned local descriptors*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2017.

2. **Liberty Dataset**: The citation is:
   > A. Mishchuk, D. Mishkin, F. Radenovic, and J. Matas. *Working hard to know your neighbor’s margins: Local descriptor learning loss*. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS), 2017.

3. **Yosemite Dataset**: The citation is:
   > A. Mishchuk, D. Mishkin, F. Radenovic, and J. Matas. *Working hard to know your neighbor’s margins: Local descriptor learning loss*. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS), 2017.

4. **Notre-Dame Dataset**: The citation is:
   > A. Mishchuk, D. Mishkin, F. Radenovic, and J. Matas. *Working hard to know your neighbor’s margins: Local descriptor learning loss*. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS), 2017.

Since the Liberty, Yosemite, and Notre-Dame datasets are all referenced in the same paper, I will use the same citation for all three.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations, ensuring that I have accurately documented each dataset's name and citation for future reference or processing.
