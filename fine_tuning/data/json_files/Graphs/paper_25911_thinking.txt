To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Hierarchical Graph Representation Learning with Differentiable Pooling" by Rex Ying et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors achieved state-of-the-art results on several graph classification benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they mention several datasets, including:

1. **ENZYMES**: A dataset used for enzyme classification, which consists of 600 graphs representing different enzymes.
2. **PROTEINS**: This dataset contains 1,113 protein graphs, where each graph represents a protein structure.
3. **D&D**: A dataset consisting of 1,178 graphs representing different protein structures, specifically designed for graph classification tasks.
4. **REDDIT-MULTI-12K**: A social network dataset containing 12,000 graphs, each representing a different subreddit.
5. **COLLAB**: A dataset of scientific collaboration networks, which includes 5,000 graphs representing collaborations between authors.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

For example, the citations might look like this:

- **ENZYMES**: 
  > K. M. Borgwardt, C. S. Ong, S. Schönauer, S. V. N. Vishwanathan, A. J. Smola, and H.-P. Kriegel. *Protein function prediction via graph kernels*. Bioinformatics, 21(Supplement 1):i47–i56, 2005.

- **PROTEINS**: 
  > K. M. Borgwardt, C. S. Ong, S. Schönauer, S. V. N. Vishwanathan, A. J. Smola, and H.-P. Kriegel. *Protein function prediction via graph kernels*. Bioinformatics, 21(Supplement 1):i47–i56, 2005.

- **D&D**: 
  > P. D. Dobson and A. J. Doig. *Distinguishing enzyme structures from non-enzymes without alignments*. Journal of Molecular Biology, 330(4):771–783, 2003.

- **REDDIT-MULTI-12K**: 
  > P. Yanardag and S. V. N. Vishwanathan. *A structural smoothing framework for robust graph comparison*. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, pages 2134–2142, 2015.

- **COLLAB**: 
  > P. Yanardag and S. V. N. Vishwanathan. *A structural smoothing framework for robust graph comparison*. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, pages 2134–2142, 2015.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, facilitating further exploration and validation of the findings presented in the paper.
