To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-Behavior Graph Neural Networks for Recommender System" by Lianghao Xia et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and evaluation sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on real-world datasets, which indicates that datasets are likely discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **evaluation section** where the authors summarize the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they explicitly mention three datasets:

1. **Tmall Dataset**: This dataset is described as containing user interactions on the Tmall e-commerce platform, including four types of user behaviors: click, add-to-cart, tag-as-favorite, and purchase. The dataset includes 147,894 users and 99,037 items.

2. **BeiBei Dataset**: This dataset is from a large infant product retail site in China, containing 21,716 users and 7,977 items, with three types of interactions: click, add-to-cart, and purchase.

3. **IJCAI-Competition Dataset**: This dataset is sourced from the IJCAI competition repository, involving 423,423 users and 874,328 items, with four types of interactions: click, add-to-cart, tag-as-favorite, and purchase.

I will then check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. However, since these datasets are commonly used in the research community, they may not have formal citations in the references section. Instead, I will note the details provided in the paper itself.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset names, descriptions, and any relevant statistics such as the number of users and items.

Finally, I will ensure that each dataset entry is clear and includes the necessary details for someone who may want to reference or utilize these datasets in their own research.
