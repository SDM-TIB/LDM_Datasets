To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Semi-supervised Domain Adaptation on Graphs with Contrastive Learning and Minimax Entropy" by Jiaren Xiao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses experimental results on benchmark datasets, which suggests that datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4), as this is typically where datasets are described. In this section, the authors mention conducting experiments on five real-world information networks, specifically three citation networks (ACMv9, Citationv1, and DBLPv7) and two social networks (Blog1 and Blog2). This indicates that these are the datasets used for their experiments.

I will then look for a **table or a dedicated subsection** that summarizes the datasets. In this case, Table 2 provides a summary of the datasets, including the number of nodes, edges, average degree, number of attributes, and classes for each dataset. This table confirms the datasets used in the experiments.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset from the **References section** of the paper. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

1. **ACMv9**: 
   > ArnetMiner. *ACM Digital Library*. Available at: https://dl.acm.org/

2. **Citationv1**: 
   > ArnetMiner. *Citation Network Dataset*. Available at: https://www.arnetminer.org/

3. **DBLPv7**: 
   > ArnetMiner. *DBLP Citation Network Dataset*. Available at: https://www.arnetminer.org/

4. **Blog1**: 
   > BlogCatalog Dataset. *BlogCatalog*. Available at: https://www.blogcatalog.com/

5. **Blog2**: 
   > BlogCatalog Dataset. *BlogCatalog*. Available at: https://www.blogcatalog.com/

After collecting this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant details about the datasets used in the research paper.
