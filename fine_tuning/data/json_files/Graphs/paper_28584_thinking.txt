To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Probabilistic Spatial Distribution Prior Based Attentional Keypoints Matching Network" by Xiaoming Zhao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors conducted image matching experiments on **visual SLAM datasets**, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, they mention three specific datasets:

1. **InteriorNet Dataset**: This dataset is described as providing 20 million synthetic RGBD images, IMU data, and ground-truth camera poses. It was created based on real-world decorations and is noted for its accuracy in depth maps and IMU measurements.

2. **TUM-RGBD Dataset**: This dataset contains data captured by Kinect-V1 and a motion capture system in various indoor environments. It includes RGBD images, ground truth camera poses, and accelerometer readings.

3. **ETH3D Dataset**: This dataset provides well-calibrated RGBD images and ground truth camera poses, along with time-aligned IMU measurements. It is suitable for training the proposed model.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **InteriorNet Dataset**, the citation is:
  > W. Li, S. Saeedi, J. McCormac, R. Clark, D. Tzoumanikas, Q. Ye, Y. Huang, R. Tang, and S. Leutenegger. *InteriorNet: Mega-scale Multi-sensor Photo-realistic Indoor Scenes Dataset*. In British Machine Vision Conference (BMVC), 2018.

- For the **TUM-RGBD Dataset**, the citation is:
  > J. Sturm, N. Engelhard, F. Endres, W. Burgard, and D. Cremers. *A benchmark for the evaluation of RGB-D SLAM systems*. In 2012 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems, 2012.

- For the **ETH3D Dataset**, the citation is:
  > T. Schops, T. Sattler, and M. Pollefeys. *BAD SLAM: Bundle Adjusted Direct RGB-D SLAM*. In 2019 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2019.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will prepare to format this information according to the required structure for downstream processing.
