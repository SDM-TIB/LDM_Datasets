To extract datasets from the research paper titled "K-PLUG: Knowledge-injected Pre-trained Language Model for Natural Language Understanding and Generation in E-Commerce" by Song Xu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that K-PLUG is verified in a diverse range of e-commerce scenarios, which suggests that datasets related to these scenarios might be discussed later in the paper.

Next, I will look for specific sections that typically contain dataset information, such as **section 3 (Knowledge-injected Pre-training)** and **section 4 (Experiments and Results)**. In these sections, the authors often describe the datasets used for training and evaluation.

In **section 4.2 (Downstream Tasks)**, the authors detail three specific tasks: e-commerce knowledge base completion, abstractive product summarization, and multi-turn dialogue. Each task is likely to have a corresponding dataset mentioned.

1. **MEPAVE Dataset**: This dataset is used for the e-commerce knowledge base completion task. It consists of 87,194 instances annotated with product attribute values. The training, validation, and testing sets contain 71,194, 8,000, and 8,000 instances, respectively. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Tiangang Zhu, Yue Wang, Haoran Li, Youzheng Wu, Xiaodong He, and Bowen Zhou. *Multimodal joint attribute prediction and value extraction for e-commerce product*. In Proceedings of the 2020 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), 2020.

2. **CEP-SUM Dataset**: This dataset is used for the abstractive product summarization task and contains 1.4 million instances collected from a major Chinese e-commerce platform. Each instance is a pair of product information and product summary. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Li, H., Yuan, P., Xu, S., Wu, Y., He, X., and Zhou, B. *Aspect-aware multimodal summarization for Chinese e-commerce products*. In Proceedings of the Thirty-Fourth AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI), 2020.

3. **JDDC Dataset**: This dataset is used for the multi-turn dialogue task and contains 1,024,196 multi-turn sessions and 20,451,337 utterances. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Meng Chen, Ruixue Liu, Lei Shen, Shaozu Yuan, Jingyan Zhou, Youzheng Wu, Xiaodong He, and Bowen Zhou. *The JDDC corpus: A large-scale multi-turn Chinese dialogue dataset for E-commerce customer service*. In Proceedings of the 12th Language Resources and Evaluation Conference, 2020.

After identifying these datasets, I will ensure that I have the correct citations and details for each dataset as they are crucial for proper referencing in any subsequent work.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format for easy access and review, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its citation.
