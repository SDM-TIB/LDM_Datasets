To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Contrastive Unsupervised Learning for Audio Fingerprinting" by Zhesong Yu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant details, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental settings sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a general overview of the research but does not specify datasets. The introduction discusses audio fingerprinting and mentions various algorithms but does not name specific datasets either.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experimental Settings and Results)**, which is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets used in the experiments. In this section, the authors explicitly mention two datasets:

1. **VoxCeleb2**: This dataset is described as containing short speech clips extracted from interview videos on YouTube. It includes a development set (VoxCeleb2-Dev) with 1,092,009 utterances from 5,994 celebrities and a test set (VoxCeleb2-Test) with 36,237 utterances from 118 celebrities.

2. **In-house Music Dataset**: This dataset consists of 345,000 music tracks of various genres, divided into a training set (Music-Train) with 340,000 tracks and a test set (Music-Test) with 5,000 tracks.

The authors also mention that they combined VoxCeleb2-Dev and Music-Train for training, resulting in a total of 1,432,009 audio tracks.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **VoxCeleb2**, the citation is:
  > J. S. Chung, A. Nagrani, and A. Zisserman. *Voxceleb2: Deep speaker recognition*. In INTERSPEECH, 2018.

- The **in-house music dataset** does not have a specific citation provided in the paper, as it is a dataset created by the authors for their experiments.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **VoxCeleb2**: A large dataset of speech clips from YouTube interviews, with a development set and a test set.
2. **In-house Music Dataset**: A collection of music tracks created by the authors for their experiments.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and citations, ensuring that all necessary details are captured for future reference or processing.
