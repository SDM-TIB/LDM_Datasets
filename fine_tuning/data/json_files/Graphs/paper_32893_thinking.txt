To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Two-Stage Deep Learning Framework for Quality Assessment of Left Atrial Late Gadolinium Enhanced MRI Images" by K M Arefeen Sultan et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the challenges of obtaining high-quality LGE MRI images and hints at the use of a dataset for quality assessment.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Results)**, where the authors explicitly mention their dataset. They state that their dataset includes **196 scans of labeled data for the QA task and 900 scans that have the blood pool segmentations**. This indicates that there are two distinct datasets being utilized.

In this section, the authors provide details about the scans, including that they were acquired with a specific resolution and pulse sequence. They also mention that the 196 scans were scored by experts, which is crucial information for understanding the dataset's context.

Now, I will look into the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. However, the paper does not provide specific citations for the datasets themselves, as they seem to be original data collected by the authors. Therefore, I will note that the dataset is proprietary to this study and does not have an external citation.

The key datasets extracted from the paper are:

1. **LGE MRI Dataset**: This dataset consists of 196 scans labeled for quality assessment and 900 scans with blood pool segmentations. The scans were acquired approximately 15 minutes after gadolinium administration, using a 3D ECG-gated, respiratory navigated gradient echo inversion recovery pulse sequence.

Since there are no external citations for these datasets, I will summarize the information as follows:

- **Dataset Name**: LGE MRI Dataset
- **Description**: Includes 196 labeled scans for quality assessment and 900 scans with blood pool segmentations, acquired with a specific imaging protocol.
- **Citation**: No external citation available; dataset is proprietary to the study.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
