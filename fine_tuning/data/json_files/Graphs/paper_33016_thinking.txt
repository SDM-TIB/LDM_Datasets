To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Topological, or Non-topological? A Deep Learning Based Prediction" by Ashiqur Rasul et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the development of a deep learning model for predicting topological materials, which suggests that datasets are likely involved in the training and evaluation of this model. The introduction further emphasizes the importance of large-scale datasets in machine learning applications in material science.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methods** section. In this paper, section 4.1 titled "Dataset" provides crucial information. It states that the dataset consists of 33,800 material entries, categorized into topologically trivial materials, topological insulators, and topological semimetals. This section gives me the necessary details about the dataset's composition.

The paper specifies that the dataset was collected from the **Topological Quantum Chemistry database** and includes various properties such as crystallographic information and topological invariants. This is a key piece of information that I need to document.

Now, I will retrieve the full citation for the dataset mentioned. The paper references the Topological Quantum Chemistry database, which is accessible online. I will ensure to include the URL in the citation for completeness.

The citation for the dataset is:
> Topological Quantum Chemistry database. Available at: https://www.topologicalquantumchemistry.org/

Finally, I will compile the extracted information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and full citation as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.
