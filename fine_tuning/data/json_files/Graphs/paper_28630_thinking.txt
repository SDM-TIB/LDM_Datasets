To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Improving Zero-shot Generalization in Offline Reinforcement Learning using Generalized Similarity Functions" by Bogdan Mazoure et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention key datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors often discuss the context of their work and may reference specific datasets that are relevant to their research. I will look for phrases that indicate the use of datasets, such as "we evaluated our method on" or "we used the following datasets."

In the **methodology section**, particularly in subsections that discuss experiments or benchmarks, the authors typically provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used. I will look for sections that explicitly mention dataset names, their characteristics, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

In this paper, the authors introduce the **ofl ine Procgen benchmark**, which is a significant dataset for their experiments. They describe it as consisting of 5 million transitions from 200 related levels of 16 distinct games sampled from the "easy" game mode. This is a clear indication of a dataset that is central to their research.

I will also check the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. For the ofl ine Procgen benchmark, the citation is:
> Cobbe, K., Hesse, C., Hilton, J., & Schulman, J. (2020). Leveraging procedural generation to benchmark reinforcement learning. In International Conference on Machine Learning (pp. 2048â€“2056). PMLR.

After identifying the datasets and their citations, I will ensure to document each dataset's name, description, and citation in a structured manner. This will include the name of the dataset, a brief description of its contents and purpose, and the full citation as found in the references.

Finally, I will compile all the extracted information into a coherent format that can be easily reviewed or processed further.
