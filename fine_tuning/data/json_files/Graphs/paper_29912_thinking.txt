To extract datasets from the research paper titled "QT-ROUTENET: IMPROVED GNN GENERALIZATION TO LARGER 5G NETWORKS BY FINE-TUNING PREDICTIONS FROM QUEUEING THEORY" by Bruno Klaus de Aquino Afonso and Lilian Berton, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the work and may mention datasets used for evaluation or training. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the methodology or experiments sections. In this paper, there is a reference to the dataset used in the context of the GNNet Challenge 2021, which is crucial for understanding the data involved.

In the **framework section**, the authors describe the dataset's characteristics, including the training, validation, and test samples. They mention that the training set consists of 120,000 samples with networks of sizes ranging from 25 to 50 nodes, while the validation set has larger networks (up to 300 nodes). This indicates that the dataset is structured to evaluate the model's generalization capabilities.

I will also check the **appendices** for any additional details about the dataset creation process or specific attributes of the dataset. The paper mentions that the dataset was generated using packet simulators and that it includes various attributes related to network traffic, such as average packets generated and link capacities.

Now, I will compile the full citations for the datasets mentioned in the paper. The authors reference the GNNet Challenge 2021, which is a significant dataset for their experiments. The citation for this dataset is:

- **GNNet Challenge 2021 Dataset**:
  > International Telecommunication Union (ITU). "ITU AI/ML in 5G Challenge." 2021. Available at: https://aiforgood.itu.int/meet-the-winning-teams-in-the-itu-ai-ml-in-5g-challenge.

Finally, I will summarize the findings regarding the dataset, ensuring that I include the full citation for the GNNet Challenge dataset, as it is crucial for proper attribution and further research.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited.
