To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On Pitfalls of Measuring Occlusion Robustness Through Data Distortion" by Antonia Marcu, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are referenced. The abstract discusses the impact of data distortion on evaluating occlusion robustness, which suggests that datasets are likely involved in the experiments.

Next, I will examine the **methodology and experiments sections** to find specific datasets used in the research. In the introduction, the author mentions using **CIFAR-10** and **CIFAR-100** datasets for training models with various data augmentation techniques. This indicates that these datasets are central to the experiments.

In the **experiments section**, the author describes the use of these datasets in detail, particularly in relation to the mixed-sample augmentations like MixUp and CutMix. The paper also references the use of **FashionMNIST** for additional experiments, which is another dataset I need to note.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

1. **CIFAR-10 Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Alex Krizhevsky et al. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. 2009.

2. **CIFAR-100 Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Alex Krizhevsky et al. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. 2009. (Note: CIFAR-100 is often referenced alongside CIFAR-10, and the same citation applies.)

3. **FashionMNIST Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Han Xiao, Kashif Rasul, and Roland Vollgraf. *Fashion-MNIST: A novel image dataset for benchmarking machine learning algorithms*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1708.07747, 2017.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes the full citation as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
