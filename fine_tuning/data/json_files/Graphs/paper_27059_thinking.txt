To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Dense Attention Fluid Network for Salient Object Detection in Optical Remote Sensing Images" by Qijian Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors constructed a new dataset for salient object detection, which suggests that there is a dataset to extract.

Next, I will focus on **section IV (Extended Optical Remote Sensing Saliency Detection (EORSSD) Dataset)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset they created. Here, they mention that the EORSSD dataset contains 2,000 images with pixel-wise saliency annotations, which is a significant dataset for their research.

In this section, the authors describe the dataset's construction process, including the number of images, the labeling protocol, and the challenges associated with the dataset. They also mention that the dataset is publicly available, which is important for citation purposes.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the original dataset they extended, which is the ORSSD dataset. The authors reference this dataset as the first publicly available dataset for the RSI SOD task, which contains 800 images.

The citations I need to extract are:

1. **EORSSD Dataset**: The authors do not provide a specific citation for this dataset in the text, but they mention that it is available at their project website. I will note this as the dataset is newly constructed by the authors.

2. **ORSSD Dataset**: The authors reference the original dataset as follows:
   > C. Li, R. Cong, J. Hou, S. Zhang, Y. Qian, and S. Kwong. *Nested network with two-stream pyramid for salient object detection in optical remote sensing images*. IEEE Trans. Geosci. Remote Sens., vol. 57, no. 11, pp. 9156â€“9166, 2019.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets extracted from the paper:

- **EORSSD Dataset**: Contains 2,000 images with pixel-wise saliency annotations, publicly available at their project website.
- **ORSSD Dataset**: Contains 800 images, the first publicly available dataset for the RSI SOD task.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
