To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Graph Contrastive Learning Automated" by Yuning You et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions "multiple graph datasets of various scales and types," indicating that datasets are indeed involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets and Experiment Settings)**, where the authors provide a detailed list of datasets used in their experiments. Here, I will find specific names and descriptions of the datasets:

1. **NCI1**: A dataset of biochemical molecules, consisting of 4110 graphs with an average of 29.87 nodes and an average degree of 1.08.

2. **PROTEINS**: Another dataset of biochemical molecules, containing 1113 graphs with an average of 39.06 nodes and an average degree of 1.86.

3. **COLLAB**: A social network dataset with 5000 graphs, an average of 74.49 nodes, and an average degree of 32.99.

4. **RDT-B**: A social network dataset with 2000 graphs, an average of 429.63 nodes, and an average degree of 1.15.

In addition to these datasets, the authors mention that they use datasets from the **TUDataset** benchmark and the **Open Graph Benchmark (OGB)**, specifically the **ogbg-ppa** and **ogbg-code** datasets. I will need to look up the full citations for these datasets in the references section.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **NCI1** and **PROTEINS**, the citations are:
  > Riesen, K. and Bunke, H. Iam graph database repository for graph based pattern recognition and machine learning. In Joint IAPR International Workshops on Statistical Techniques in Pattern Recognition (SPR) and Structural and Syntactic Pattern Recognition (SSPR), pp. 287–297. Springer, 2008.

- For **COLLAB**, the citation is:
  > Yanardag, P. and Vishwanathan, S. Deep graph kernels. In Proceedings of the 21th ACM SIGKDD international conference on knowledge discovery and data mining, pp. 1365–1374, 2015.

- For **RDT-B**, the citation is:
  > Morris, C., Kriege, N. M., Bause, F., Kersting, K., Mutzel, P., and Neumann, M. Tudataset: A collection of benchmark datasets for learning with graphs. arXiv preprint arXiv:2007.08663, 2020.

- For **ogbg-ppa** and **ogbg-code**, the citations are:
  > Hu, W., Fey, M., Zitnik, M., Dong, Y., Ren, H., Liu, B., Catasta, M., and Leskovec, J. Open graph benchmark: Datasets for machine learning on graphs. arXiv preprint arXiv:2005.00687, 2020a.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented and properly cited.
