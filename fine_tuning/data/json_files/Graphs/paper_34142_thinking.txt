To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Contrastive Hypothesis Selection for Multi-View Depth Refinement" by Di Qiu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract provides a brief overview of the proposed method, CHOSEN, but does not mention specific datasets. The introduction discusses the context of multi-view stereo (MVS) but again does not specify any datasets.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section 4) closely, as this is typically where datasets used for evaluation are detailed. In this section, the authors mention that they evaluate their method on the **DTU dataset** and the **BlendedMVS dataset**. I will note these datasets as they are crucial for understanding the experiments conducted.

I will then look for any specific details about these datasets in the text. The DTU dataset is referenced multiple times, particularly in the context of evaluating depth and normal quality. The authors also mention that they trained their model on the DTU dataset and mixed it with the BlendedMVS dataset for improved performance.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. **DTU Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Jensen, R., Dahl, A., Vogiatzis, G., Tola, E., & Aanæs, H. (2014). Large scale multi-view stereopsis evaluation. In Proceedings of the IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition (pp. 406–413).

2. **BlendedMVS Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Yao, Y., Luo, Z., Li, S., Zhang, J., Ren, Y., Zhou, L., Fang, T., & Quan, L. (2020). BlendedMVS: A large-scale dataset for generalized multi-view stereo networks. In Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR).

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and that the full citations are included. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper, which is essential for understanding the context and validity of the experiments conducted.
