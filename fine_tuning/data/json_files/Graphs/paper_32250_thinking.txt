To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Adaptation and Communication in Human-Robot Teaming to Handle Discrepancies in Agentsâ€™ Beliefs about Plans" by Yuening Zhang and Brian Williams, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often discusses the context and previous work, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will look for specific sections that might detail the datasets used in the experiments. In this case, I will focus on sections that discuss the **experiments or evaluations**, as these typically contain information about the datasets employed.

As I read through the paper, I will take note of any datasets that are explicitly named, along with their descriptions, sizes, and any relevant details about how they were used in the research. If the authors mention any datasets without providing full citations, I will check the **References section** to find the complete citations for those datasets.

For example, if the authors mention using a dataset like "the Multi-Agent Planning Dataset" in their experiments, I will look for the full citation in the references. If the dataset is not explicitly cited, I will note the details provided in the text and search for the original source if necessary.

Once I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will ensure to write down the full citations in the appropriate format. This is crucial for proper attribution and for others who may wish to access the datasets.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset, its description, and its citation, ensuring that all necessary details are included for future reference.
