To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Trustworthy Knowledge Graph Completion Based on Multi-sourced Noisy Data" by Jiacheng Huang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and it may mention datasets used for experiments or evaluations.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 6) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, I will look for any tables or figures that summarize dataset statistics, as these often provide clear information about the datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention a specific dataset created by OKELE for evaluating their method. They provide statistical data about this dataset in **Table 1**, which includes various classes of entities and the number of facts associated with each class. This is a crucial piece of information for dataset extraction.

I will also check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The authors reference the OKELE dataset, which is essential for proper attribution.

The citation for the OKELE dataset is:
> Huang, J., Zhao, Y., Hu, W., Ning, Z., Chen, Q., Qiu, X., Huo, C., & Ren, W. (2022). Trustworthy Knowledge Graph Completion Based on Multi-sourced Noisy Data. In Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2022 (WWW ’22), April 25–29, 2022, Virtual Event, Lyon, France. ACM, New York, NY, USA, 10 pages. https://doi.org/10.1145/3485447.3511938

Now, I will compile the extracted dataset information, including the dataset name, description, and full citation, into a structured format for further use.

In summary, the steps I followed to extract the datasets from the paper were:
1. Read the abstract and introduction for initial mentions of datasets.
2. Focus on the experiments section for detailed descriptions and statistics.
3. Identify specific datasets mentioned, such as the OKELE dataset.
4. Retrieve full citations from the references section for proper attribution.
5. Compile the information into a structured format for clarity and usability.
