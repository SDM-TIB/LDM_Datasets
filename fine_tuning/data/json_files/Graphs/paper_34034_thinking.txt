To extract datasets from the research paper titled "NaNa and MiGu: Semantic Data Augmentation Techniques to Enhance Protein Classification in Graph Neural Networks" by Yi-Shan Lan et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their methods on the **EC dataset** and **SCOPe classification dataset**, which suggests that these are the primary datasets used in their experiments.

Next, I will look specifically in **section 4.2 (Datasets)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used:

1. **SCOPe Classification Dataset**: This dataset contains 12,312 training samples, 1,123 validation samples, and 710 testing samples, focusing on protein structures in three-dimensional space and encompassing 1,123 different classes. 

2. **EC Dataset**: Designed for predicting enzymatic functions, this dataset comprises 29,210 training samples, 2,562 validation samples, and 5,645 testing samples, with a total of 384 different classes.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **SCOPe Classification Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Andreeva, A., Howorth, D., Chandonia, J.-M., Brenner, S. E., Hubbard, T. J., Chothia, C., and Murzin, A. G. *Data growth and its impact on the scop database: new developments*. Nucleic acids research, 2007.

- For the **EC Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Bairoch, A. *The enzyme database in 2000*. Nucleic acids research, 2000.

Now that I have the dataset names and their corresponding citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets and their references as required.
