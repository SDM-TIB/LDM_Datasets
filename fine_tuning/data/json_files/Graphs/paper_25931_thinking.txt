To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Non-iterative recomputation of dense layers for performance improvement of DCNN" by Yimin Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the proposed method is evaluated on **six widely accepted object recognition benchmark datasets**, which indicates that datasets are present.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental section** where the authors describe their evaluation process. In this section, they provide a table (Table 2) that lists the datasets used in their experiments along with relevant details such as the number of training images per category, total training images, total testing images, and the number of categories.

The datasets mentioned in the paper are:

1. **Scene15**: This dataset contains 4,486 gray-value images across 15 scene categories, with 100 images per category used for training.
2. **CIFAR-10**: This dataset consists of 60,000 color images in 10 categories, with 50,000 images for training and 10,000 for testing.
3. **CIFAR-100**: Similar to CIFAR-10, this dataset has 60,000 color images but spans 100 categories, with the same training and testing split as CIFAR-10.
4. **SUN397**: This dataset includes approximately 100,000 images across 397 categories, with 50 images per class used for training and testing.
5. **Places365**: A large-scale dataset with around 1,800,000 images across 365 categories, with varying numbers of training images per class.
6. **ImageNet**: A well-known large-scale dataset with approximately 1.2 million images for training and 50,000 for validation, spanning 1,000 classes.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations into a structured format for further processing or review.
