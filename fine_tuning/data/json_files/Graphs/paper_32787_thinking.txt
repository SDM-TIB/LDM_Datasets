To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Physics-Informed Graph Neural Network for Dynamic Reconfiguration of Power Systems" by Jules Authier et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, but the experimental results section is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of dynamic reconfiguration in power systems and mention the need for effective algorithms, but they do not specify any datasets here.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental results section**. Here, the authors describe their evaluation of the GraPhyR framework on specific distribution grids. They mention using the **BW-33 grid** and a variant called **G1**, as well as a real distribution grid model known as **TPC-94**. 

The paper states that the BW-33 grid consists of 33 nodes, 29 lines, and 8 switches, while G1 has the same number of nodes but different lines and switches. The TPC-94 grid has 94 nodes and 14 switches. The authors also mention that they use datasets from a previous work (reference [3]) that introduces distributed solar generation in the grid.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. **BW-33 Grid**: The citation for the original work describing this grid is:
   > M. Baran and F. Wu, “Network reconfiguration in distribution systems for loss reduction and load balancing,” IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery, vol. 4, no. 2, pp. 1401–1407, 1989.

2. **G1 Grid**: Since G1 is a variant of BW-33, it does not have a separate citation. It is derived from the BW-33 grid.

3. **TPC-94 Grid**: The citation for the TPC-94 grid is:
   > C.-T. Su, C.-F. Chang, and J.-P. Chiou, “Distribution network reconfiguration for loss reduction by ant colony search algorithm,” Electric Power Systems Research, vol. 75, no. 2, pp. 190–199, 2005.

Additionally, the authors reference the dataset from the work by Haider and Annaswamy (reference [3]), which is crucial for understanding the context of the datasets used. The citation for this work is:
   > R. Haider and A. M. Annaswamy, “Grid-siphyr: An end-to-end learning to optimize framework for combinatorial problems in power systems,” 2023, arXiv:2206.06789v3 [eess.SY].

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will summarize the findings:

1. **BW-33 Grid**: A canonical distribution grid with 33 nodes, 29 lines, and 8 switches.
   - Citation: M. Baran and F. Wu, “Network reconfiguration in distribution systems for loss reduction and load balancing,” IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery, vol. 4, no. 2, pp. 1401–1407, 1989.

2. **G1 Grid**: A variant of the BW-33 grid with the same number of nodes but different lines and switches. No separate citation.

3. **TPC-94 Grid**: A model of a real distribution grid with 94 nodes and 14 switches.
   - Citation: C.-T. Su, C.-F. Chang, and J.-P. Chiou, “Distribution network reconfiguration for loss reduction by ant colony search algorithm,” Electric Power Systems Research, vol. 75, no. 2, pp. 190–199, 2005.

4. **Dataset from Haider and Annaswamy**: Used for introducing distributed solar generation in the grid.
   - Citation: R. Haider and A. M. Annaswamy, “Grid-siphyr: An end-to-end learning to optimize framework for combinatorial problems in power systems,” 2023, arXiv:2206.06789v3 [eess.SY].

With this information, I can now compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
