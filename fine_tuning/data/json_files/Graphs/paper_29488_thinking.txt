To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Cross-modal Contrastive Learning for Speech Translation" by Rong Ye et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions evaluating the proposed method on a popular benchmark called **MuST-C**, which indicates that this dataset is likely important for the research.

Next, I will look into **section 4.1 (Experimental Setups)**, where the authors discuss the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they explicitly mention the **MuST-C dataset**, which is described as containing over 385 hours of TED talks for various language pairs (English to German, Spanish, French, Italian, Dutch, Portuguese, Romanian, and Russian). This section provides a clear indication of the dataset's significance and its application in the experiments.

Additionally, the authors reference **WMT datasets** and **OPUS100 datasets** for machine translation tasks, which are also mentioned in the context of their experiments. I will note these datasets as well, as they are relevant to the study.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper from the **References section**:

1. **MuST-C Dataset**:
   > Mattia A. Di Gangi, Roldano Cattoni, Luisa Bentivogli, Matteo Negri, and Marco Turchi. *MuST-C: a Multilingual Speech Translation Corpus*. In Proceedings of NAACL-HLT, pages 2012–2017, 2019.

2. **WMT Datasets**:
   > Ondˇrej Bojar, Rajen Chatterjee, Christian Federmann, Yvette Graham, Barry Haddow, Matthias Huck, Antonio Jimeno Yepes, Philipp Koehn, Varvara Logacheva, Christof Monz, Matteo Negri, Aurélie Névéol, Mariana Neves, Martin Popel, Matt Post, Raphael Rubino, Carolina Scarton, Lucia Specia, Marco Turchi, Karin Verspoor, and Marcos Zampieri. *Findings of the 2016 Conference on Machine Translation*. In Proceedings of the First Conference on Machine Translation: Volume 2, Shared Task Papers, pages 131–198, 2016.

3. **OPUS100 Datasets**:
   > Pierre Lison and Jörg Tiedemann. *OpenSubtitles2016: Extracting large parallel corpora from movie and TV subtitles*. In Proceedings of LREC, pages 923–929, 2016.

After identifying the datasets and their citations, I will summarize the findings:

- **MuST-C**: A multilingual speech translation corpus with over 385 hours of TED talks across multiple languages.
- **WMT Datasets**: A collection of datasets used for machine translation tasks.
- **OPUS100 Datasets**: A set of datasets extracted from movie and TV subtitles for translation tasks.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that highlights each dataset along with its full citation, ensuring that all details are accurately represented for future reference or analysis.
