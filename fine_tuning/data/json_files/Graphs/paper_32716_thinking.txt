To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DimCL: Dimensional Contrastive Learning For Improving Self-Supervised Learning" by Thanh Nguyen et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that extensive experimental results were conducted on various datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section V), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention evaluating DimCL on five widely used benchmark datasets: **CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, STL-10, ImageNet-100, and ImageNet-1K**. This is a clear indication that these datasets are crucial for the experiments.

I will also check the **implementation details** and **results** sections to gather more information about how these datasets were utilized, including any specific configurations or metrics reported.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

1. **CIFAR-10**:
   > Alex Krizhevsky et al. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. 2009.

2. **CIFAR-100**:
   > Alex Krizhevsky et al. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. 2009.

3. **STL-10**:
   > Adam Coates, Andrew Ng, and Honglak Lee. *An analysis of single-layer networks in unsupervised feature learning*. In Proceedings of the fourteenth international conference on artificial intelligence and statistics, pages 215–223. JMLR Workshop and Conference Proceedings, 2011.

4. **ImageNet-100**:
   > Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, and Li Fei-Fei. *ImageNet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In 2009 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 248–255, 2009.

5. **ImageNet-1K**:
   > Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, and Li Fei-Fei. *ImageNet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In 2009 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 248–255, 2009.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant datasets and their citations from the paper.
