To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Higher-order Graph Convolutional Networks" by John Boaz Lee et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used. 

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically looking for any subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. In this paper, the authors mention that they compare their method against strong baselines on three established graph benchmarks for semi-supervised node classification. This indicates that datasets are likely discussed in detail.

In the **experiments section**, I will look for a subsection titled **Datasets** or similar. Here, the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments:

1. **Cora Dataset**: This dataset is described as an undirected citation network with 2,708 nodes, 5,429 edges, 7 classes, and 1,433 node features.

2. **Citeseer Dataset**: This dataset is also an undirected citation network, consisting of 3,327 nodes, 4,732 edges, 6 classes, and 3,703 node features.

3. **Pubmed Dataset**: This dataset comprises 19,717 nodes, 44,338 edges, 3 classes, and 500 node features.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The authors typically cite the original papers or sources from which these datasets were derived. 

For the datasets mentioned, I will look for the following citations:

- For the **Cora Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yang, Z., Cohen, W. W., & Salakhutdinov, R. (2016). Revisiting semi-supervised learning with graph embeddings. In ICML, 40–48.

- For the **Citeseer Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yang, Z., Cohen, W. W., & Salakhutdinov, R. (2016). Revisiting semi-supervised learning with graph embeddings. In ICML, 40–48.

- For the **Pubmed Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yang, Z., Cohen, W. W., & Salakhutdinov, R. (2016). Revisiting semi-supervised learning with graph embeddings. In ICML, 40–48.

Since the authors used a pre-processed version of these datasets made available by Yang et al. (2016), this citation applies to all three datasets.

Finally, I will compile the extracted dataset information, including their descriptions and full citations, ensuring that I maintain clarity and accuracy in the representation of each dataset's details.
