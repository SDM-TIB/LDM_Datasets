To extract datasets from the research paper titled "One Model for All Quantization: A Quantized Network Supporting Hot-Swap Bit-Width Adjustment" by Qigong Sun et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on **ImageNet** and **COCO**, which suggests that these datasets are likely to be detailed further in the paper.

Next, I will look closely at **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe their experimental setup. In this section, they explicitly mention using **ImageNet** and **COCO** for their experiments. I will gather specific details about these datasets, such as their purpose and any relevant statistics provided in the text.

1. **ImageNet**: This dataset is described as a large-scale dataset for image classification tasks, containing more than 1.2 million training images and 50,000 validation images. It is widely used in academic research for benchmarking image classification algorithms.

2. **COCO (Common Objects in Context)**: This dataset is noted for its use in object detection and instance segmentation tasks. It consists of images from 80 different categories, with 115,000 images for training and 5,000 images for validation.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with sources for further exploration.

- For **ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, Serge Belongie, James Hays, Pietro Perona, Deva Ramanan, Piotr Dollár, and C Lawrence Zitnick. *Microsoft COCO: Common objects in context*. In ECCV, pages 740–755. Springer, 2014.

- For **COCO**, the citation is:
  > Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, Serge Belongie, James Hays, Pietro Perona, Deva Ramanan, Piotr Dollár, and C Lawrence Zitnick. *Microsoft COCO: Common objects in context*. In ECCV, pages 740–755. Springer, 2014.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their descriptions and citations into a structured format that can be used for further processing or review. This ensures that all relevant information is captured and properly attributed.
