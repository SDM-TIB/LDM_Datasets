To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A 3D-Shape Similarity-based Contrastive Approach to Molecular Representation Learning" by Austin Atsango et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention key datasets used for evaluation or experimentation.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly section 4, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, I will look for any specific dataset names, descriptions, and the context in which they are used.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention a dataset called **ROCS100k**. This dataset is described as containing 100,000 molecules from the ChEMBL database, used to generate a complete all-by-all similarity matrix of Shape- and ColorTanimoto scores. The paper also notes that this dataset was created through conformer generation and scoring, which is crucial for understanding its application in the research.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the ChEMBL database, as it is the source of the ROCS100k dataset. The relevant citations are:

- For the ChEMBL database, the citation is:
  > Anna Gaulton, Louisa J Bellis, A Patricia Bento, Jon Chambers, Mark Davies, Anne Hersey, Yvonne Light, Shaun McGlinchey, David Michalovich, Bissan Al-Lazikani, and John P Overington. *ChEMBL: a large-scale bioactivity database for drug discovery*. Nucleic Acids Res., 40(Database issue):D1100–7, January 2012.

- Additionally, the citation for the updated ChEMBL database is:
  > David Mendez, Anna Gaulton, A Patrícia Bento, Jon Chambers, Marleen De Veij, Eloy Félix, María Paula Magariños, Juan F Mosquera, Prudence Mutowo, Michal Nowotka, María Gordillo-Marañón, Fiona Hunter, Laura Junco, Grace Mugumbate, Milagros Rodriguez-Lopez, Francis Atkinson, Nicolas Bosc, Chris J Radoux, Aldo Segura-Cabrera, Anne Hersey, and Andrew R Leach. *ChEMBL: towards direct deposition of bioassay data*. Nucleic Acids Res., 47(D1):D930–D940, January 2019.

With these citations, I have gathered the necessary information to describe the dataset in detail.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including the names, descriptions, and full citations, into a structured format for further processing or review.
