To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Bayesian Tensor Factorisation for Bottom-up Hidden Tree Markov Models" by Daniele Castellana and Davide Bacciu, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental analysis sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors validate their model on two different tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental analysis section** where the authors describe their evaluation methods. Here, they mention using two datasets for their experiments: the **INEX05 dataset** and the **INEX06 dataset**. I will extract the relevant details about these datasets.

1. **INEX05 Dataset**: This dataset is based on the (m-db-s-0) corpus, comprising 9,631 XML-formatted documents represented as trees with a maximum output degree of 32, assigned to 11 different clusters. The node labels represent 366 different XML tags, and the dataset is split into a training set (4,820 trees) and a test set (4,811 trees).

2. **INEX06 Dataset**: This dataset consists of 12,107 XML-formatted documents representing scientific articles from 18 different IEEE journals, with node labels representing 65 different XML tags and a maximum output degree of 66. The dataset is split into a training set (6,053 trees) and a test set (6,054 trees).

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. However, the paper does not provide specific citations for the datasets used, as they are likely well-known datasets in the field.

Now, I will compile the information about each dataset, ensuring to include the details and context provided in the paper. The full citations may not be available, but I will note the datasets as they are described in the paper.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for downstream processing, ensuring that all relevant information is captured accurately.
