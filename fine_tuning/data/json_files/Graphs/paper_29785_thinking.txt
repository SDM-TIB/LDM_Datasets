To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Depth-aware Glass Surface Detection with Cross-modal Context Mining" by Jiaying Lin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors propose a new dataset called **RGB-D GSD** for glass surface detection, which is a strong indication that this dataset is central to their research.

Next, I will look for detailed descriptions of the datasets in the **methodology section**. In this section, the authors describe the construction of the **RGB-D GSD dataset**, which consists of 3,009 RGB-D images with precise annotations. They also mention that this dataset is constructed from three existing datasets: **SUN RGB-D**, **2D-3D-Semantics**, and **Matterport3D**.

I will then gather specific details about each dataset:

1. **RGB-D GSD Dataset**: This dataset is specifically designed for glass surface detection and contains 3,009 images. The authors emphasize its large scale and the diversity of scenes it covers.

2. **SUN RGB-D Dataset**: This dataset is referenced as a source for some of the images in the RGB-D GSD dataset. It is known for its extensive annotations for scene understanding.

3. **2D-3D-Semantics Dataset**: Another dataset used in the construction of RGB-D GSD, which provides additional scene understanding data.

4. **Matterport3D Dataset**: This dataset is also part of the RGB-D GSD construction and is known for its rich 3D reconstructions of indoor scenes.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **RGB-D GSD**, since it is a new dataset proposed by the authors, I will cite it as:

- For **2D-3D-Semantics**, the citation is:
  > Armeni, I., Sax, A. R., Zamir, A. R., and Savarese, S. *Joint 2D-3D-Semantic Data for Indoor Scene Understanding*. ArXiv e-prints, Feb. 2017.

- For **Matterport3D**, the citation is:

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented and properly cited.
