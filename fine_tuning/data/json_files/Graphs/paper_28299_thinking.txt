To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Identifying Autism Spectrum Disorder Based on Individual-Aware Down-Sampling and Multi-Modal Learning" by Li Pan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and materials and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their framework on the **ABIDE I dataset**, which is a strong indication that this dataset is central to their research.

Next, I will focus on **section 2.1 (ABIDE Dataset)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the dataset. They mention that the ABIDE I dataset was constructed by a specific group of researchers and contains data from 1,112 subjects, including MRI, fMRI, and phenotype data collected from 17 international sites. This section confirms that the ABIDE I dataset is indeed the primary dataset used in their experiments.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the ABIDE I dataset. The authors reference the dataset as follows:
> Di Martino, A., Yan, C. G., Li, Q., Denio, E., Castellanos, F. X., Alaerts, K., Anderson, J. S., Assaf, M., Bookheimer, S. Y., Dapretto, M., et al. (2014). *The autism brain imaging data exchange: towards a large-scale evaluation of the intrinsic brain architecture in autism*. Molecular Psychiatry, 19(6), 659-667.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will ensure to format this information clearly. The ABIDE I dataset is the only dataset explicitly mentioned in the paper, and it is crucial for the authors' experiments.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and full citation, ready for further processing or review.
