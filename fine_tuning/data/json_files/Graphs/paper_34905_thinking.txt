To extract datasets from the research paper titled "EA-VTR: Event-Aware Video-Text Retrieval" by Zongyang Ma et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions improvements in video-text retrieval and references the use of multiple datasets, which indicates that datasets are likely discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets and Evaluation Metrics)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for pre-training and evaluation. Here, I will find:

1. **Conceptual Captions 3M (CC3M)**: This dataset contains 3 million image-text pairs and is used for pre-training the model.
2. **WebVid-2M**: This dataset consists of 2.5 million video-text pairs and is also used for pre-training.

Additionally, I will look for downstream datasets mentioned in the same section, which include:

3. **MSRVTT**: A dataset consisting of 10,000 YouTube videos with 20 descriptions each, used for text-to-video retrieval.
4. **DiDeMo**: This dataset contains 10,000 Flickr videos with 40,000 descriptions, also used for text-to-video retrieval.
5. **LSMDC**: A dataset with 118,081 clips from 202 movies, used for video description tasks.
6. **MSVD**: This dataset includes 1,970 YouTube videos with 80,000 descriptions.

In the **References section**, I will locate the full citations for each dataset:

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries with their full citations to ensure clarity and completeness in the extraction process. This structured approach will help in accurately documenting the datasets used in the research.
