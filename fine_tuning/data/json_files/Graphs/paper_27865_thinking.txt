To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Counterfactual Generative Zero-Shot Semantic Segmentation" by Feihong Shen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors compare their model on two real-world datasets, which suggests that these datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they refer to two datasets:

1. **Pascal-VOC 2012**: The authors describe this dataset as containing 1464 training images and 1449 validation images, with 20 object classes and one background class.

2. **Pascal-Context**: This dataset is noted for providing full annotations of images in Pascal-VOC 2010, including over 400 classes, but the authors focus on the most frequent 59 classes for evaluation.

To confirm the details and obtain full citations, I will check the **References section** of the paper:

- For **Pascal-VOC 2012**, the citation is:
  > Everingham, M., Van Gool, L., Williams, C. K. I., Winn, J., & Zisserman, A. (2010). The Pascal Visual Object Classes (VOC) Challenge. *International Journal of Computer Vision*, 88(2), 303-338.

- For **Pascal-Context**, the citation is:
  > Mottaghi, R., Chen, X., Liu, X., Cho, N.-G., Lee, S.-W., Fidler, S., Urtasun, R., & Yuille, A. (2014). The Role of Context for Object Detection and Semantic Segmentation in the Wild. In *Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition* (CVPR), 891-898.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will summarize the findings clearly, ensuring that I include the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations for each dataset.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference and further processing.
