To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Mixture of Weak & Strong Experts on Graphs" by Hanqing Zeng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the contributions and may mention datasets used for evaluation. The introduction typically outlines the context and significance of the research, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as this is where the authors usually describe the datasets used for their experiments in detail. I will look for any specific sections that mention datasets, such as "Datasets" or "Experimental Setup."

In the **experiments section**, I will look for any tables or figures that summarize the datasets, including their characteristics such as the number of nodes, edges, classes, and features. The authors may also provide insights into how these datasets were constructed or their relevance to the research.

Once I identify the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

For example, if I find that the paper mentions the following datasets:

1. **Flickr Dataset**: A graph where each node represents an image uploaded to Flickr, with edges indicating shared properties.
2. **ogbn-products Dataset**: An Amazon product co-purchasing network where nodes represent products and edges indicate frequent co-purchases.

I will then look up their citations in the References section:

- For the **Flickr Dataset**, the citation might be:
  > Zeng, H., Zhou, H., Srivastava, A., Kannan, R., & Prasanna, V. (2020). *Flickr: A Dataset for Evaluating Proximity Preserving and Structural Role-Based Node Embeddings*. In Proceedings of the Workshop on Graph Learning Benchmarks at TheWebConf 2021.

- For the **ogbn-products Dataset**, the citation might be:
  > Hu, W., Fey, M., Zitnik, M., Dong, Y., Ren, H., Liu, B., Catasta, M., & Leskovec, J. (2020). *Open Graph Benchmark: Datasets for Machine Learning on Graphs*. Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 33, 22118â€“22133.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the dataset name, description, and full citation for each dataset in a structured format for further use or analysis.
