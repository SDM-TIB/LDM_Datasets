To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Accelerating discrete dislocation dynamics simulations with graph neural networks" by Nicolas Bertina and Fei Zhou, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any references to datasets used for training or validation.

Next, I will focus on **Section 3 (Application: the dislocation-obstacle glide model)**, where the authors describe the DDD simulations and the dataset generated for training the GNN model. In this section, they mention that they generated a dataset of ground-truth DDD trajectories, which includes configurations, applied stresses, and nodal displacements recorded during simulations.

The authors specify that they ran **100 simulations**, each with **10,000 time-steps**, and recorded configurations every **100 steps**, resulting in a total of **10,000 training configurations**. They also describe the parameters used for the simulations, such as the dimensions of the simulation volume and the range of obstacle densities and strain rates.

I will also check the **References section** to find any citations related to the datasets used. However, in this case, the dataset is generated by the authors themselves, so I will focus on documenting the details provided in the paper.

The key dataset extracted from the paper is:

1. **DDD Training Dataset**: This dataset consists of ground-truth DDD trajectories generated from simulations. It includes dislocation graph configurations, applied stresses, and nodal displacements recorded at frequent intervals during the simulations.

Now, I will compile the full citation for the dataset as follows:

- For the **DDD Training Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Bertina, N., & Zhou, F. (2023). Accelerating discrete dislocation dynamics simulations with graph neural networks. *Journal of Computational Physics*. Preprint submitted on April 25, 2023.

After gathering this information, I will prepare the dataset entry in the required format, ensuring that the citation is included for proper attribution. This structured approach will ensure that I capture all relevant details about the dataset used in the research paper.
