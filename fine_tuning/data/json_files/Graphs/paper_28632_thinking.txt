To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ZeroCap: Zero-Shot Image-to-Text Generation for Visual-Semantic Arithmetic" by Yoad Tewel et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of models trained on large corpora, which suggests that datasets are involved. I will look for any specific dataset names mentioned in these sections.

Next, I will proceed to the **methodology** and **experiments** sections, as these typically provide detailed information about the datasets used for training and evaluation. In the methodology section, I will look for any references to datasets that were utilized in the experiments or for training the models.

In this paper, the authors mention using the **MS-COCO dataset** for their experiments. I will note down the details provided about this dataset, including its purpose and any specific characteristics mentioned.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. For the **MS-COCO dataset**, I will look for the original paper that describes it to ensure I have the correct citation.

The citation for the **MS-COCO dataset** is:
> Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, Serge Belongie, James Hays, Pietro Perona, Deva Ramanan, Piotr Dollár, and C Lawrence Zitnick. *Microsoft COCO: Common objects in context*. In European conference on computer vision, pages 740–755. Springer, 2014.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the findings:

1. **MS-COCO Dataset**: This dataset is widely used for image captioning tasks and contains images with corresponding captions, making it suitable for training and evaluating models like the one proposed in this paper.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly presents the dataset and its citation, ready for further processing or review.
