To extract datasets from the research paper titled "NCAGC: A Neighborhood Contrast Framework for Attributed Graph Clustering" by Tong Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors conducted extensive experiments on four attributed graph datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed involved.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **Datasets** section or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this case, the authors mention four datasets: **Cora**, **Citeseer**, **Wiki**, and **ACM**. I will note down the details provided about each dataset, including their characteristics such as the number of nodes, edges, attributes, and classes.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide a table (Table I) that summarizes the statistics of these datasets, which includes the following information:

1. **Cora**: A citation network with 2,708 nodes, 5,429 edges, 1,433 attributes, and 7 classes.
2. **Citeseer**: Another citation network with 3,327 nodes, 4,732 edges, 3,703 attributes, and 6 classes.
3. **Wiki**: A webpage network with 2,405 nodes, 17,981 edges, 4,973 attributes, and 17 classes.
4. **ACM**: A paper network with 3,025 nodes, 29,281 edges, 1,870 attributes, and 3 classes.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- **Cora**: 
  > McCallum, A. K., Nigam, K., Rennie, J., & Seymore, K. (2000). Automating the construction of internet portals with machine learning. *Information Retrieval*, 3(2), 127-163.

- **Citeseer**: 
  > Giles, C. L., Bollacker, K. D., & Lawrence, S. (1998). Citeseer: An automatic citation indexing system. In *Proceedings of the third ACM conference on Digital libraries* (pp. 89-98).

- **Wiki**: 
  > Yang, C., Liu, Z., Zhao, D., Sun, M., & Chang, E. (2015). Network representation learning with rich text information. In *IJCAI*.

- **ACM**:

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described with its full citation. This structured approach will help in creating a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
