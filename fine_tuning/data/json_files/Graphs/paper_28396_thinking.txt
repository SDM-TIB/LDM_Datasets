To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Model Adaptation: Historical Contrastive Learning for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation without Source Data" by Jiaxing Huang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and the introduction typically outlines the context and significance of the research, which may include references to datasets.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) and mention the need for datasets that facilitate this research. However, I need to look for specific dataset names and details.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention several datasets:

1. **GTA5**: This dataset consists of 24,966 synthetic images and shares 19 categories with the Cityscapes dataset.
2. **SYNTHIA**: This dataset contains 9,400 synthetic images and shares 16 categories with Cityscapes.
3. **Cityscapes**: This dataset includes 2,975 real-world images for training and 500 for validation.
4. **Foggy Cityscapes**: This dataset is derived from Cityscapes by applying simulated fog to the images.
5. **BDD100k**: This dataset has 70,000 training images and 10,000 validation images, sharing 7 categories with Cityscapes.
6. **VisDA17**: This dataset contains 152,409 synthetic images as the source domain and 55,400 real images of 12 shared categories as the target domain.
7. **Office-31**: This dataset includes 4,110 images from three sources: Amazon, Webcam, and DSLR, with 31 shared categories.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The citations I will look for include:

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries with their full citations for further processing or review.
