To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Boosting Neural Networks to Decompile Optimized Binaries" by Ying Cao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their method on datasets containing various types of statements, which indicates that datasets are indeed involved. I will look for specific names or descriptions of these datasets.

Next, I will carefully read through the **methodology** and **experiments** sections, particularly focusing on any sections that discuss dataset construction or evaluation. In this paper, the authors describe the generation of a dataset consisting of 20,000 functions, which were compiled using different optimization levels. This dataset is crucial for their experiments.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide details about the dataset used for training their model. They mention that they generated 80,000 pairs of LIR/HIR (Low-level Intermediate Representation/High-level Intermediate Representation) through their tool, which is a significant dataset for their evaluation.

I will also check the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. However, in this case, the authors do not cite external datasets but rather describe their own dataset generation process. Therefore, I will summarize the dataset details based on the information provided in the paper.

The key datasets identified are:

1. **Generated Dataset of Functions**: This dataset consists of 20,000 functions generated randomly, which were compiled at optimization levels O0 to O3. The authors state that this dataset is used to evaluate their model's performance.

2. **LIR/HIR Pairs**: The authors mention that they obtained 80,000 pairs of LIR and HIR through their tool, which is essential for training their neural model.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the relevant details about each dataset, such as the purpose, size, and any specific characteristics mentioned in the paper.

Finally, I will prepare the full citations for the datasets as follows:

- For the **Generated Dataset of Functions**, since it is an original dataset created by the authors, I will cite it as:
  > Ying Cao, Ruigang Liang, Kai Chen, and Peiwei Hu. "Boosting Neural Networks to Decompile Optimized Binaries." In Annual Computer Security Applications Conference (ACSAC ’22), December 5–9, 2022, Austin, TX, USA. ACM, New York, NY, USA, 14 pages. https://doi.org/10.1145/3564625.3567998

- For the **LIR/HIR Pairs**, I will use the same citation as it is derived from the same research work.

After gathering all this information, I will ensure that it is presented clearly and accurately, ready for any further processing or review.
