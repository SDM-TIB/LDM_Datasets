To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Unified Medical Image-Text-Label Contrastive Learning With Continuous Prompt" by Yuhao Wang, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, method, and experiment sections** to locate any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a general overview of the research but does not specify datasets. Therefore, I will focus on the **introduction** and **experiments** sections for more detailed information.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of medical data annotation and the potential of using large-scale datasets for Image-Text Pre-training. However, they do not list specific datasets here. I will then move to the **experiments section**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the datasets used for pre-training and evaluation.

In **section 3.1 (Datasets and Implementation details)**, the authors mention several datasets:

1. **CheXpert**: This dataset contains 224,316 chest X-rays from 65,240 patients, with labeled information from free-text reports describing the presence of 14 common chest diseases.
   
2. **MIMIC-CXR**: This dataset includes nearly 227,835 chest X-ray images, each corresponding to a text report from various US medical institutions.

3. **CheXpert-5x200**: A multi-class classification dataset sampled from the testing split of CheXpert, containing 200 positive samples for each of the classes.

4. **MIMIC-5x200**: Similar to CheXpert-5x200, this dataset is sampled for evaluation purposes.

5. **COVID-19**: A dataset collected from several hospitals in Qatar, containing a balanced subset of COVID and non-COVID cases.

6. **RSNA pneumonia**: This dataset contains 26,684 chest X-ray images of patients with pneumonia and normal individuals, sampled for evaluation.

Next, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. 

- For **CheXpert**, the citation is:

(2021). *Exploring the effect of image enhancement techniques on COVID-19 detection using chest X-ray images*. Computers in Biology and Medicine.

- For **RSNA pneumonia**, the citation is:
  > Shih, G., Wu, C.C., Halabi, S., Kohli, M.D., Prevedello, L.M., Cook, T.S., Sharma, A., Amorosa, J.K., Arteaga, V., Galperin-Aizenberg, M., Gill, R.R., Godoy, M.C.B., Hobbs, S.B., Jeudy, J., Laroia, A.T., Shah, P., Vummidi, D., Yaddanapudi, K., Stein, A. (2019). *Augmenting the National Institutes of Health Chest Radiograph Dataset with Expert Annotations of Possible Pneumonia*. Radiology.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
