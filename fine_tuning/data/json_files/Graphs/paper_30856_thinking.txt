To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Dynamic Graph Node Classification via Time Augmentation" by Jiarui Sun et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors perform node classification experiments on four dynamic graph benchmarks, which indicates that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used. In this section, they list four datasets: **WIKI**, **REDDIT**, **ML-RATING**, and **ML-GENRE**. I will take note of the details provided for each dataset, including the number of nodes, edges, timestamps, classes, and the train/test splits.

Now, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:

1. **WIKI Dataset**:
   > "Wikipedia edit history dump," https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Data_dumps.

2. **REDDIT Dataset**:
   > "Reddit data dump," http://files.pushshift.io/reddit/.

3. **ML-RATING Dataset**:
   > Harper, F. M., & Konstan, J. A. (2015). "The movielens datasets: History and context." ACM Transactions on Interactive Intelligent Systems, 5(4), 1-19.

4. **ML-GENRE Dataset**:
   > Harper, F. M., & Konstan, J. A. (2015). "The movielens datasets: History and context." ACM Transactions on Interactive Intelligent Systems, 5(4), 1-19.

Note that both the **ML-RATING** and **ML-GENRE** datasets reference the same source, as they are part of the MovieLens dataset collection.

Finally, I will compile the information about each dataset, including their characteristics and full citations, into a structured format for further use.

By following this methodical approach, I ensure that I accurately extract and cite all datasets mentioned in the paper.
