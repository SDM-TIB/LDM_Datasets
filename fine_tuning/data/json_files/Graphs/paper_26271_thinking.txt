To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Learning High-order Structural and Attribute information by Knowledge Graph Attention Networks for Enhancing Knowledge Graph Embedding" by Wenqiang Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract states that empirical results are shown on three datasets, which indicates that there are datasets to extract.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically the part where the authors describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they mention three datasets:

1. **FB24K**: This dataset is derived from Freebase and contains 23,643 entities, 673 relations, 314 attributes, and a total of 423,560 triples.

2. **DBP24K**: This dataset is collected from DBpedia and includes 22,951 entities, 2,561 relations, 1,561 attributes, and a total of 437,561 triples.

3. **Game30K**: This is a self-constructed dataset from a game knowledge graph, consisting of 30,845 entities, 1,318 relations, 2,760 attributes, and a total of 370,140 triples.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. The authors mention the original sources of the datasets:

- For **FB24K**, the citation is:
  > Lin, Y., Liu, Z., and Sun, M. (2016). Knowledge representation learning with entities, attributes and relations. In Proceedings of the Twenty-Fifth International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence, 2866–2872. AAAI Press.

- For **DBpedia**, the citation is:
  > Auer, S., Bizer, C., Kobilarov, G., Lehmann, J., Cyganiak, R., and Ives, Z. (2007). DBpedia: A nucleus for a web of open data. The Semantic Web, 722–735.

- For **Freebase**, the citation is:
  > Bollacker, K., Evans, C., Paritosh, P., Sturge, T., and Taylor, J. (2008). Freebase: A collaboratively created graph database for structuring human knowledge. In Proceedings of the 2008 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data, 1247–1250. ACM.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use. This includes ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation, which is crucial for proper attribution in any subsequent analysis or reporting.
