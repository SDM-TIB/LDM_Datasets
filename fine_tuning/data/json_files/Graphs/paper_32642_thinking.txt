To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Enhancing Representation in Radiography-Reports: Foundation Model: A Granular Alignment Algorithm Using Masked Contrastive Learning" by Weijian Huang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments using **6 well-known open-source X-ray datasets**, which suggests that multiple datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **Datasets section** of the paper, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used. Here, they mention:

1. **MIMIC-CXR v2**: This dataset comprises 377,110 chest X-rays associated with 227,827 clinical reports sourced from the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center between 2011 and 2016. This dataset is used for pre-training the MaCo model.

2. **CheXpert**: A multi-label dataset for chest X-ray classification, which includes 218,414 training images, 5,000 validation images, and 234 test images. The authors follow specific guidelines for evaluation.

3. **NIH ChestX-ray**: This dataset contains 112,120 frontal-view chest radiograph images, focusing on a multi-label classification problem involving 14 different chest pathologies. The dataset is split into training, validation, and test sets.

4. **COVID-19 Rural**: A small-scale dataset comprising over 200 chest X-ray images with segmentation masks for COVID-19. The dataset is split into training, validation, and test sets.

5. **SIIM-ACR Pneumothorax**: This dataset includes over 120,000 frontal-view chest X-rays with manual segmentation of pneumothorax regions. The dataset is used for segmentation and zero-shot classification tasks.

6. **RSNA Pneumonia Detection**: Derived from the 2018 RSNA Pneumonia Challenge, this dataset consists of 6,012 slices with bounding box annotations, used for classification and detection tasks.

7. **MS-CXR**: This dataset provides annotations in the form of bounding boxes and sentence pairs describing clinical findings in chest X-ray images. It is used for measuring the overlap between labeled bounding boxes and results of vision-language association.

After identifying these datasets, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
