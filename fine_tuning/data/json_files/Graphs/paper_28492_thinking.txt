To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Transportation Scenario Planning with Graph Neural Networks" by Ana Alice Peregrino et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on urban mobility and scenario planning, which suggests that datasets related to commuting flows and urban indicators may be involved.

Next, I will examine **section 4 (Model Training and Results)**, where the authors describe the data used for training and validating their models. Here, they mention using open datasets from two Brazilian cities: Recife and Curitiba. This section is likely to contain detailed descriptions of the datasets.

In **subsection 4.1 (Data description)**, the authors provide specific information about the datasets used:

1. **Recife Commuting Flow Dataset**: This dataset was obtained from a survey conducted by the city’s administration between 2018 and 2019, capturing typical commuting movements in the metropolitan region. It includes data on 1,347 census tracts, resulting in 23,336 commuters and 15,945 pairs of origin-destination trips.

2. **Curitiba Commuting Flow Dataset**: This dataset was obtained from a survey carried out by the city’s administration in 2017, mapping commuting patterns in the metropolitan region. It includes data on 2,200 census tracts, resulting in 45,365 commuters and 32,988 pairs of origin-destination trips.

The authors also mention urban indicators used in conjunction with these datasets, which are sourced from the respective cities' open data portals.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

- For the **Recife Commuting Flow Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Prefeitura do Recife. 2021. Portal de Dados Abertos do Recife. http://dados.recife.pe.gov.br/.

- For the **Curitiba Commuting Flow Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Prefeitura de Curitiba. 2021. Instituto de Pesquisa e Planejamento Urbano de Curitiba. https://ippuc.org.br.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their sources, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset along with its citation. This will ensure that the datasets are properly documented and can be referenced in future work.
