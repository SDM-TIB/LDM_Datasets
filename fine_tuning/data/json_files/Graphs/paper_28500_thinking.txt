To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Nonnegative Tucker Decomposition with Beta-divergence for Music Structure Analysis of Audio Signals" by Axel Marmoret et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental framework sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the application of Nonnegative Tucker Decomposition (NTD) in music structure analysis, which suggests that datasets related to music may be involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention the RWC-Pop database as a standard dataset in music information retrieval. This is a clear indication that a dataset is being utilized for their experiments.

Next, I will look into **section 4 (Experimental Framework)**, particularly **subsection 4.1 (NTD for music processing)**, where the authors describe the TFB tensor, which is derived from the RWC-Pop database. They mention that the NTD is performed on a 3rd-order tensor created from audio signals, indicating that the dataset is crucial for their analysis.

In **subsection 4.2 (Music structure analysis based on NTD)**, the authors again refer to the RWC-Pop dataset while discussing segmentation results. This reinforces the importance of this dataset in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the RWC-Pop dataset. The citation provided in the references is:

- For the **RWC Music Database**, the citation is:
  > M. Goto, H. Hashiguchi, T. Nishimura, and R. Oka. *RWC Music Database: Popular, Classical and Jazz Music Databases*. In ISMIR, 2002, vol. 2, pp. 287â€“288.

Since the paper primarily discusses the RWC-Pop database, I will focus on this dataset for extraction.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry with the full citation into a structured format for further processing. This ensures that all relevant information is captured accurately and can be utilized effectively in subsequent analyses or applications.
