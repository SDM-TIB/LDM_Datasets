To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning the Implicit Semantic Representation on Graph-Structured Data" by Likang Wu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions conducting experiments on several standard datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed used in this research.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they list the datasets along with their characteristics, which is crucial for understanding their relevance and application.

The paper mentions the following datasets:

1. **Pubmed**: A citation network dataset with 19,717 nodes, 44,338 edges, and 3 classes. The features correspond to a bag-of-words representation of documents.

2. **Citeseer**: Another citation network dataset with 4,732 nodes, 3,327 edges, and 6 classes, also represented in a bag-of-words format.

3. **Cora**: This dataset consists of 2,708 nodes, 5,429 edges, and 7 classes, similarly using a bag-of-words representation.

4. **Blogcatalog**: A social network dataset with 10,312 nodes, 333,983 edges, and 39 classes. This dataset is multi-label, meaning each node can belong to multiple classes.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The paper cites the following sources for the datasets:

- For **Pubmed**, **Citeseer**, and **Cora**, the citation is:
  > Sen, P., Namata, G., Bilgic, M., Getoor, L., Galligher, B., Eliassi-Rad, T. "Collective classification in network data." AI magazine 29(3), 93–93 (2008).

- For **Blogcatalog**, the citation is:
  > Tang, L., Liu, H. "Leveraging social media networks for classification." Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery 23(3), 447–478 (2011).

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that can be used for further analysis or processing. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their sources as required.
