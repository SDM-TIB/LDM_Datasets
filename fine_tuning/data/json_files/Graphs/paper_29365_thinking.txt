To extract datasets from the research paper titled "GL-CLEF: A Globalâ€“Local Contrastive Learning Framework for Cross-lingual Spoken Language Understanding" by Libo Qin et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract highlights the use of a framework for zero-shot cross-lingual spoken language understanding, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of spoken language understanding (SLU) and the need for annotated data, hinting at the datasets used for evaluation. I will look for specific mentions of datasets in this section.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**. Here, the authors explicitly mention that they conducted experiments on the **MultiATIS++ dataset**. This dataset is crucial for their evaluation of the proposed GL-CLEF framework.

I will then check the **background and related work sections** to see if there are any additional datasets referenced that might have been used in previous studies or comparisons.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The key dataset identified is:

- **MultiATIS++**: This dataset is referenced multiple times throughout the paper, particularly in the context of evaluating the performance of the proposed model.

The citation for the **MultiATIS++ dataset** is:
> Xu, W., Haider, B., & Mansour, S. (2020). End-to-end slot alignment and recognition for cross-lingual NLU. In Proceedings of the 2020 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), pages 1-10.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
