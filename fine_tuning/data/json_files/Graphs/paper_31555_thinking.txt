To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Anchor Transformations for 3D Garment Animation" by Fang Zhao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions but may not explicitly mention datasets. The introduction typically outlines the context and may reference datasets used in prior work or the current study.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as this is where the authors usually describe the datasets utilized for their evaluations. In this paper, the authors mention evaluating their method on the **VTO dataset**, which is crucial for my extraction.

I will look for specific details about the **VTO dataset** in the experiments section. The authors state that the VTO dataset contains two types of garments: dresses and T-shirts. This indicates that the dataset is diverse and relevant for the study of garment animation.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the VTO dataset. The paper does not provide a direct citation for the VTO dataset, but it references other works that may have used or created it. I will need to identify the original source of the VTO dataset to provide a complete citation.

After reviewing the references, I find that the VTO dataset is associated with the work by Santesteban et al. (2019), which is cited in the paper. The full citation for the VTO dataset is:

> Igor Santesteban, Miguel A. Otaduy, and Dan Casas. *Learning-Based Animation of Clothing for Virtual Try-On*. Computer Graphics Forum (Proc. Eurographics), 2019.

With this information, I can now summarize the dataset extraction:

1. **VTO Dataset**: This dataset is used for evaluating the proposed method and contains two types of garments: dresses and T-shirts. It is essential for assessing the performance of the AnchorDEF model.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, ensuring that I include the full citation for the VTO dataset as required. This structured approach ensures that I accurately capture all necessary details for future reference or processing.
