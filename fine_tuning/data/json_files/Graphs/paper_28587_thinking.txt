To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Enabling Automated FPGA Accelerator Optimization Using Graph Neural Networks" by Atefeh Sohrabizadeh et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and evaluation sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or benchmarks used in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors often discuss the context of their research and may mention specific datasets or benchmarks that are relevant to their work. I will take note of any datasets that are explicitly named or described.

I will then examine the **methodology** section, particularly any subsections that detail the experimental setup or data collection processes. This section is likely to contain specific information about the datasets used, including their names, sizes, and any relevant characteristics.

Following that, I will review the **evaluation** section, where the authors typically discuss the results of their experiments. This section may provide additional insights into the datasets used, including performance metrics or comparisons with other datasets.

Once I have identified the datasets, I will check the **references section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, if the authors mention using a dataset like the "Machsuite benchmark" or "Polybench," I will look for the corresponding citations in the references. I will ensure to capture the full citation format as it appears in the paper.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, into a structured format that clearly presents each dataset's information.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets referenced in the paper, providing a comprehensive overview that includes proper citations for each dataset.
