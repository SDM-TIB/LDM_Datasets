To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MetaMask: Revisiting Dimensional Confounder for Self-Supervised Learning" by Jiangmeng Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and it may mention datasets used for evaluation or experimentation.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors often discuss the context of their work and may reference existing datasets that are relevant to their research. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or benchmarks.

Then, I will examine the **experiments section**, as this is typically where authors detail the datasets used for their experiments. I will look for specific names of datasets, descriptions of their contents, and any relevant statistics (e.g., number of samples, classes, etc.).

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets.

For this paper, I will specifically look for datasets mentioned in the context of self-supervised learning and contrastive learning, as these are the main themes of the research.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for easy reference and further processing.
