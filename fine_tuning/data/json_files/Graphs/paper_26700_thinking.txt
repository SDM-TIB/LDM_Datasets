To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Graph Neural Networks for Node-Level Predictions" by Christoph Heindl, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections that discuss experiments and benchmarks**. The abstract provides a general overview, but I will focus on sections that explicitly mention datasets.

In **section 6 (Benchmarks)**, the author introduces three datasets used for benchmarking node-level GNNs: **Pubmed, Citeseer, and Cora**. This section provides a clear indication that these datasets are essential for the experiments conducted in the paper.

Next, I will gather detailed descriptions of each dataset from the text. The paper states that:

1. **Pubmed**: This dataset consists of 19,717 nodes (documents), 44,338 edges (citations), 500 features (word occurrences), and 3 classes.
2. **Citeseer**: This dataset has 3,327 nodes, 4,732 edges, 3,703 features, and 6 classes.
3. **Cora**: This dataset includes 2,708 nodes, 5,429 edges, 1,433 features, and 7 classes.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The paper cites the following works:

- For **Pubmed**, **Citeseer**, and **Cora**, the citation is:
  > Zhilin Yang, William W. Cohen, and Ruslan Salakhutdinov. *Revisiting Semi-supervised Learning with Graph Embeddings*. In Proceedings of the 33rd International Conference on International Conference on Machine Learning - Volume 48 (ICML’16). JMLR.org, 40–48. http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3045390.3045396

This citation covers all three datasets as they are commonly referenced together in the context of GNN benchmarking.

Finally, I will compile the extracted information into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented and properly cited.
