To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SAM-guided Graph Cut for 3D Instance Segmentation" by Haoyu Guo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on several datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 5), where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they list three datasets:

1. **ScanNet (V2)**: This dataset is described as a large-scale RGB-D dataset containing 1613 indoor scenes with geometry acquired by BundleFusion and images captured by an iPad Air2.

2. **ScanNet++**: This dataset contains 280 indoor scenes with high-fidelity geometry acquired by the Faro Focus Premium laser scanner and high-resolution RGB images captured by an iPhone 13 Pro and a DSLR camera with a fisheye lens.

3. **KITTI-360**: This dataset is a large outdoor dataset with 300 suburban scenes, consisting of 320k images and 100k laser scans obtained through a mobile platform over a driving distance of 73.7 km.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **ScanNet (V2)**, the citation is:
  > Angela Dai, Angel X Chang, Manolis Savva, Maciej Halber, Thomas Funkhouser, and Matthias Nießner. *ScanNet: Richly-annotated 3D reconstructions of indoor scenes*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2017.

- For **ScanNet++**, the citation is:
  > Chandan Yeshwanth, Yueh-Cheng Liu, Matthias Nießner, and Angela Dai. *ScanNet++: A high-fidelity dataset of 3D indoor scenes*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2023.

- For **KITTI-360**, the citation is:
  > Yiyi Liao, Jun Xie, and Andreas Geiger. *KITTI-360: A novel dataset and benchmarks for urban scene understanding in 2D and 3D*. IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence (PAMI), 2022.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
