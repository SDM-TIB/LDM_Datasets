To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Hyper-Relational Knowledge Graph Neural Network for Next POI Recommendation" by Jixiao Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on four real-world LBSN datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they state that they evaluated their model on datasets from four cities: **New York City (NYC)**, **Jakarta (JK)**, **Kuala Lumpur (KL)**, and **São Paulo (SP)**. They also mention that these datasets are publicly available from Foursquare and include check-in records, friendships, and POI locations.

I will then look for the **dataset details** provided in Table 1, which summarizes the statistics of the datasets. This table includes the number of users, POIs, check-ins, friendships, and entities for each dataset, confirming their relevance for the experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The authors refer to the Foursquare dataset, which is crucial for proper citation. The citation for the Foursquare dataset is as follows:

- For the Foursquare dataset:
  > Yang, D., Fankhauser, B., Rosso, P., & Cudre-Mauroux, P. (2019). Revisiting user mobility and social relationships in LBSNs: a hypergraph embedding approach. In The World Wide Web Conference (WWW), 2147–2157.

With this information, I can summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **New York City (NYC) Dataset**: Contains check-in records, friendships, and POI locations from users in New York City.
2. **Jakarta (JK) Dataset**: Similar to the NYC dataset but focused on users in Jakarta.
3. **Kuala Lumpur (KL) Dataset**: Contains data from users in Kuala Lumpur, including check-ins and social relationships.
4. **São Paulo (SP) Dataset**: Includes check-in records and social data from users in São Paulo.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and includes the full citation for the Foursquare dataset.

After completing this process, I will have a structured output ready for further use or analysis.
