To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Improving Group Robustness on Spurious Correlation Requires Preciser Group Inference" by Yujin Han and Difan Zou, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that empirical studies were conducted on multiple datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper. The introduction will likely provide context on the datasets used for the experiments.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors discuss their method (GIC) and its application to various datasets. I will pay close attention to any specific names or descriptions of datasets used in their experiments.

Upon reviewing the paper, I identify the following datasets mentioned:

1. **CMNIST**: This dataset is described as a noisy digit recognition task where digit colors serve as a spurious feature. The authors reference the original work by Arjovsky et al. (2019) for this dataset.

2. **Waterbirds**: This dataset is used to classify bird images with spurious correlations between bird types and backgrounds. The authors cite Sagawa et al. (2019) as the source for this dataset.

3. **CelebA**: This dataset is utilized for hair-color prediction based on celebrity images, with spurious correlations to gender. The authors reference Liu et al. (2015) and Sagawa et al. (2019) for this dataset.

4. **CivilComments-WILDS**: This dataset is used for classifying online comments as toxic or non-toxic, with spurious correlations to demographic identities. The authors cite Borkan et al. (2019) and Koh et al. (2021) as sources for this dataset.

Now, I will compile the full citations for each dataset based on the references provided in the paper:

- For **CMNIST**, the citation is:
  > Arjovsky, M., Bottou, L., Gulrajani, I., & Lopez-Paz, D. (2019). *Invariant risk minimization*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1907.02893.

- For **Waterbirds**, the citation is:
  > Sagawa, S., Koh, P. W., Hashimoto, T. B., & Liang, P. (2019). *Distributionally robust neural networks for group shifts: On the importance of regularization for worst-case generalization*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1911.08731.

- For **CelebA**, the citation is:
  > Liu, Z., Luo, P., Wang, X., & Tang, X. (2015). *Deep learning face attributes in the wild*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pp. 3730-3738.

- For **CivilComments-WILDS**, the citation is:
  > Borkan, D., Dixon, L., Sorensen, J., Thain, N., & Vasserman, L. (2019). *Nuanced metrics for measuring unintended bias with real data for text classification*. In Companion Proceedings of the 2019 World Wide Web Conference, pp. 491-500.

After gathering this information, I will ensure that I have accurately documented each dataset along with its full citation, as this is crucial for proper attribution and further research reference.
