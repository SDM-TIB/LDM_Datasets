To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Contrastive View Design Strategies to Enhance Robustness to Domain Shifts in Downstream Object Detection" by Kyle Buettner and Adriana Kovashka, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental approach sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of contrastive learning strategies on various domain shifts, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental approach section**, where the authors describe their methodology. They mention two pretraining datasets: **ImageNet-Subset** and **COCO**. The paper states that ImageNet-Subset is a sampled version of the original ImageNet dataset, reduced from over 1 million images to 50,000 images for their experiments. COCO is referenced as a standard dataset for object detection, specifically using the COCO2017 train set.

In the **domain shift datasets section**, the authors specify several datasets used for evaluation:
1. **VOC (PASCAL Visual Object Classes)**: Used for finetuning, specifically VOC0712 train+val, which contains 16,551 images.
2. **Clipart, Watercolor, and Comic**: These datasets are used for evaluating appearance shifts, collectively referred to as the **Abstract** dataset, with Clipart containing 1,000 samples and Watercolor and Comic each containing 2,000 samples.
3. **UnRel**: This dataset is used for evaluating out-of-context robustness, containing 1,049 images with unusual object relations.
4. **Pascal-C and COCO-C**: These are collections of datasets synthetically domain-shifted on natural corruption types, specifically focusing on the **VOC-Weather** and **COCO-Weather** datasets.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **ImageNet**, the citation is:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
