To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Link Stealing Attacks Against Inductive Graph Neural Networks" by Yixin Wu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** sections to get an overview of the datasets used in the research. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive evaluations on **six real-world datasets**, which indicates that multiple datasets are involved.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology or experiments sections**. In this paper, the authors provide a summary of the datasets in **Table 3**, which lists the datasets along with their characteristics such as the number of nodes, edges, density, and classes.

The datasets mentioned in the paper are:

1. **Cora**: A citation network with 2,995 nodes, 8,416 edges, a density of 0.00215, and 7 classes.
2. **Pubmed**: Another citation network with 19,717 nodes, 44,324 edges, a density of 0.00028, and 3 classes.
3. **DBLP**: A citation network with 17,716 nodes, 52,867 edges, a density of 0.00039, and 4 classes.
4. **Photo**: An Amazon co-purchase dataset with 7,650 nodes, 143,663 edges, a density of 0.00420, and 8 classes.
5. **CS**: Another Amazon co-purchase dataset with 13,752 nodes, 287,209 edges, a density of 0.00267, and 10 classes.
6. **LastFM**: A social network dataset with 7,624 nodes, 63,236 edges, a density of 0.00109, and 18 classes.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations of these datasets. The paper cites the following references for the datasets:

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their full citations into a structured format for further processing.
