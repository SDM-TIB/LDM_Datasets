To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Sign Language Translation with Hierarchical Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Network" by Jichao Kan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on benchmark datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4.1) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention two datasets:

1. **PHOENIX-2014-T**: This dataset is described as containing videos from a TV station featuring signers over three years, annotated with sign language glosses and German spoken language texts. The vocabulary size is noted as 1,115 for sign glosses and 3,000 for German.

2. **Chinese Sign Language (CSL)**: The CSL dataset is mentioned to contain two subsets, with Split II being used in this study. It includes 100 sign language sentences performed by 50 signers, recorded in RGB videos.

Now, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **PHOENIX-2014-T**, the citation is:
  > Necati Cihan Camgoz, Simon Hadfield, Oscar Koller, and Richard Bowden. *Neural Sign Language Translation*. In IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2018.

- For **CSL**, the citation is:
  > Jie Huang, Wengang Zhou, Qilin Zhang, Houqiang Li, and Weiping Li. *Video-based Sign Language Recognition without Temporal Segmentation*. In AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, 2018.

After gathering this information, I will ensure that I accurately represent each dataset's details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, in the required format for further processing or review. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details regarding the datasets used in the research.
