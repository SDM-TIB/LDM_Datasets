To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Isometric Graph Neural Networks" by Matthew Walker, Bo Yan, Yiou Xiao, Yafei Wang, and Ayan Acharya, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used in the study.

In the **experiments section**, specifically section 5.2, the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. They mention three datasets:

1. **Communities Dataset**: This dataset is generated by creating 20 cliques of size 20 each and connecting them with a probability of 0.01. The dataset is used for node pair classification tasks.

2. **Email Dataset**: This dataset consists of seven real-world email communication graphs with no node features. Each node is labeled with the community it belongs to, which is used for node pair classification.

3. **PPI Dataset**: The PPI (Protein-Protein Interaction) network contains 1113 nodes, each with a 29-dimensional feature vector representing proteins. An edge exists between two proteins if they interact, and this dataset is used for link prediction tasks.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. However, the datasets mentioned are not original datasets created by the authors but rather datasets that are commonly used in the research community. Therefore, I will provide citations for the original sources of these datasets:

- For the **Communities Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Watts, D. J. (1999). Networks, dynamics, and the small-world phenomenon. *American Journal of Sociology*, 105(2), 493-527.

- For the **Email Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Leskovec, J., Kleinberg, J., & Faloutsos, C. (2007). Graph evolution: Densification and shrinking diameters. *ACM Transactions on Knowledge Discovery from Data (TKDD)*, 1(1), 2-es.

- For the **PPI Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Zitnik, M., & Leskovec, J. (2017). Predicting multicellular function through multi-layer tissue networks. *Bioinformatics*, 33(14), i190-i198.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
