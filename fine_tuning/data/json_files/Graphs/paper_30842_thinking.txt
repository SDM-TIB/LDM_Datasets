To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Entity Set Co-Expansion in StackOverflow" by Yu Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the **StackOverﬂowNER dataset**, which is a strong indication that it is a key dataset used in the research.

Next, I will examine the **introduction section** where the authors discuss the entity set expansion task and specifically mention the **StackOverﬂowNER dataset**. They note that this dataset includes 20 types of entities, which suggests that it is a comprehensive resource for their study.

In the **experiments section**, the authors clarify that their corpus consists of two parts: the **StackOverﬂowNER dataset** and a sampled subcorpus of the Stack Exchange data dump. This confirms the use of the StackOverﬂowNER dataset and provides additional context about the second part of their corpus.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the **StackOverﬂowNER dataset**. The citation provided in the references is:

- **StackOverﬂowNER dataset**:
  > J. Tabassum, M. Maddela, W. Xu, and A. Ritter. *Code and named entity recognition in StackOverflow*. In Proceedings of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL), pages 4913–4926, 2020.

Additionally, I will note that the authors mention using a sampled subcorpus of the Stack Exchange data dump, but they do not provide a specific citation for this dataset in the paper. Therefore, I will only include the StackOverﬂowNER dataset in my final output.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, ensuring that I include the full citation for the **StackOverﬂowNER dataset** as it is crucial for proper attribution.

In summary, the key dataset extracted from the paper is the **StackOverﬂowNER dataset**, and I will document it with the appropriate citation.
