To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Academic Performance Estimation with Attention-based Graph Convolutional Networks" by Qian Hu and Huzefa Rangwala, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on a "real-world dataset obtained from a large public university." This indicates that there is at least one dataset involved, but I need to find more specific details.

Next, I will look closely at **section 4.1 (Dataset Description)**, where the authors provide statistics about the dataset used for their experiments. They mention that the data was collected at George Mason University from Fall 2009 to Spring 2018, focusing on five majors: Computer Science (CS), Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE), Biology (BIOL), Psychology (PSYC), and Civil Engineering (CEIE). The dataset includes the number of students, courses for prediction, and total grades for each major.

The statistics table (Table 1) provides the following details:
- Total number of students: 21,688
- Total number of courses for prediction: 91
- Total number of grades: 194,524

This information confirms that the dataset is comprehensive and spans multiple years and majors.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. Since the dataset is derived from George Mason University, I will look for any specific papers or reports that describe the dataset in detail. However, the paper does not provide a specific citation for the dataset itself, as it is based on institutional data.

Given that the dataset is not attributed to a specific publication, I will note that the dataset is from George Mason University and provide a general citation format for institutional datasets. 

Hereâ€™s how I will summarize the dataset information:
1. **Dataset Name**: George Mason University Academic Performance Dataset
   - **Description**: A dataset containing academic performance data of students from various majors at George Mason University, collected from Fall 2009 to Spring 2018. It includes information on student grades, courses taken, and major fields of study.
   - **Citation**: George Mason University. *Academic Performance Dataset*. Unpublished dataset.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format for further processing or review.
