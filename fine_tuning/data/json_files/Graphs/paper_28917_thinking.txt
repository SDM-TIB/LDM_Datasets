To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SMGRL: A Scalable Multi-resolution Graph Representation Learning Framework" by Reza Namazi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a general overview, but the experiments section is likely to contain specific details about the datasets used.

In **section 4.1 (Datasets and comparison methods)**, the authors explicitly list four datasets used for their experiments:

1. **Cora**: A Machine Learning citation graph labeled by subfield, containing 2,708 vertices and 10,556 edges, with 7 classes and 1,433 features.
2. **CiteSeer**: A scientific citation graph labeled by research area, consisting of 3,327 vertices and 9,104 edges, with 6 classes and 3,703 features.
3. **PubMed**: A citation graph between papers on diabetes, classified into three topics, containing 19,717 vertices and 88,648 edges, with 3 classes and 500 features.
4. **DBLP**: A Computer Science citation network labeled by subfield, comprising 17,716 vertices and 105,734 edges, with 4 classes and 1,639 features.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The paper cites the original sources for the datasets as follows:

- For **Cora** and **CiteSeer**, the citation is:
  > Sen, P., Namata, G., Bilgic, M., Getoor, L., Galligher, B., and Eliassi-Rad, T. *Collective classification in network data*. AI Magazine, 29(3):93, 2008.

- For **PubMed**, the citation is the same as above since it is part of the same dataset collection.

- For **DBLP**, the citation is:
  > Tang, J., Zhang, J., Yao, L., Li, J., Zhang, L., and Su, Z. *Arnetminer: extraction and mining of academic social networks*. In Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, 2008.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described with its relevant details and full citations. This structured approach will help in accurately documenting the datasets used in the research.
