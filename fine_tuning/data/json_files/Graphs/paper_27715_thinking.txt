To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Cross-Domain Contract Element Extraction with a Bi-directional Feedback Clause-Element Relation Network" by Zhumin Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to gather initial insights about the datasets. The abstract mentions the establishment of a cross-domain CEE dataset, which indicates that datasets are likely discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.2 (Datasets)**, where the authors provide specific details about the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they describe the datasets collected for cross-domain contract element extraction:

1. **Individual Contracts Dataset**: This dataset consists of 340 open individual Chinese contracts collected from the web. The authors note that at least two annotators with a legal background labeled the clauses and contract elements. The dataset is split into training, validation, and test sets with specific statistics provided.

2. **Commercial Contracts Dataset**: This dataset includes 1,422 business Chinese contracts sourced from partners. Similar to the individual contracts, this dataset was also annotated by legal experts and follows the same split for training, validation, and testing.

Additionally, the authors mention that they also utilize five public datasets for cross-domain named entity recognition (NER), which may be relevant for understanding the broader context of their work. However, the primary focus for dataset extraction will be on the CEE datasets.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper does not provide specific citations for the individual and commercial contracts since they are original datasets created by the authors. However, I will note the details provided in the paper for these datasets.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, ensuring to include the names, descriptions, and any relevant statistics as outlined in the paper. The full citations for the datasets will be noted as follows:

- For the **Commercial Contracts Dataset**:

With this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for further processing or review.
