To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SeBot: Structural Entropy Guided Multi-View Contrastive Learning for Social Bot Detection" by Yingguang Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. In the introduction, the authors state that they conducted experiments on "two real-world bot detection benchmark datasets." This indicates that specific datasets will be discussed later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors mention two datasets in the **experiments section**:

1. **TwiBot-20**: This dataset contains 229,580 accounts extracted from Twitter, including their following and follower interactions. It is specifically designed for evaluating social bot detection methods.

2. **MGTAB**: This dataset consists of 10,199 accounts and includes 7 types of relations such as follower, friend, mentioned, reply, quoted, reference, and hashtag. It is also used for benchmarking social bot detection methods.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **TwiBot-20**, the citation is:
  > Shangbin Feng, Herun Wan, Ningnan Wang, Jundong Li, and Minnan Luo. *Twibot-20: A comprehensive twitter bot detection benchmark*. In Proceedings of the 30th ACM International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management (CIKM), 2021.

- For **MGTAB**, the citation is:
  > Shuhao Shi, Kai Qiao, Jian Chen, Shuai Yang, Jie Yang, Baojie Song, Linyuan Wang, and Bin Yan. *MGTAB: A multi-relational graph-based twitter account detection benchmark*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2301.00001, 2023.

Having gathered this information, I will summarize the datasets and their citations clearly, ensuring that I have accurately captured all necessary details for future reference or processing.
