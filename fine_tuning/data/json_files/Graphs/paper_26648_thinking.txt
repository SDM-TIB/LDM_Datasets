To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Graph Neural Networks in TensorFlow and Keras with Spektral" by Daniele Grattarola and Cesare Alippi, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** to get an overview of the paper's focus and any mention of datasets. The abstract indicates that the library Spektral includes utilities for loading popular benchmark datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will examine **section 2 (Library Overview)**, particularly the subsection **2.4 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets available in Spektral. Here, they mention several datasets that can be loaded, which is crucial for my extraction.

The datasets mentioned in this section include:

1. **Cora**: A citation network dataset used for node classification.
2. **CiteSeer**: Another citation network dataset for node classification.
3. **Pubmed**: A citation network dataset also used for node classification.
4. **Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI)**: A dataset for graph classification tasks.
5. **Reddit Communities Network**: A dataset used in the GraphSAGE paper for node classification.
6. **QM9**: A chemical dataset of small molecules used for graph regression tasks.
7. **MNIST 8-NN**: A dataset for graph signal classification.
8. **Benchmark Data Sets for Graph Kernels**: A collection of datasets for graph classification tasks.

Next, I will verify the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are essential for proper attribution and to provide context for the datasets used in the experiments.

The citations I will look for include:

- For **Cora**, **CiteSeer**, and **Pubmed**, the citation is:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research, adhering to the importance of full citations for academic integrity and reproducibility.
