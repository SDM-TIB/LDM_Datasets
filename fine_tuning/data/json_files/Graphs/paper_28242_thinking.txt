To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Journalistic Guidelines Aware News Image Captioning" by Xuewen Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors conducted experiments on "two large-scale publicly available datasets," which indicates that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors explicitly mention using two datasets: **GoodNews** and **NYTimes800k**. I will take note of their descriptions and any relevant statistics provided.

In the **appendices**, particularly section A.1, the authors provide detailed information about the datasets. Hereâ€™s what I find:

1. **GoodNews Dataset**: 
   - Description: Collected using The New York Times public API, it includes articles, captions, and image URLs.
   - Statistics: 257,033 articles, 462,642 images, with an average article length of 653 tokens and an average caption length of 18 tokens.
   - Citation:
     > Biten, A. F., Gomez, L., Rusinol, M., & Karatzas, D. (2019). Good news, everyone! Context driven entity-aware captioning for news images. In The IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR).

2. **NYTimes800k Dataset**: 
   - Description: A larger and more complete dataset of New York Times articles, images, and captions, also collected via the New York Times public API.
   - Statistics: 444,914 articles, 792,971 images, with an average article length of 892 tokens and an average caption length of 18 tokens.
   - Citation:
     > Tran, A., Mathews, A., & Xie, L. (2020). Transform and Tell: Entity-Aware News Image Captioning. In The IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR).

After gathering this information, I will ensure that I have the full citations for both datasets, as they are crucial for proper referencing.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for easy access and review, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its citation.
