To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DyTed: Disentangled Representation Learning for Discrete-time Dynamic Graph" by Kaike Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions "extensive experiments on Tencent and five commonly used public datasets," which indicates that there are specific datasets used in their experiments.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, there is a **Table 1** that lists several datasets along with their characteristics, such as the number of nodes, edges, and snapshots. This table is crucial as it provides a concise overview of the datasets used.

The datasets listed in Table 1 are:

1. **UCI**: A communication network dataset.
2. **Bitcoin**: A who-trusts-whom network of Bitcoin users.
3. **AS733**: A routing network dataset.
4. **HepTh**: A citation network related to high-energy physics theory.
5. **HepPh**: A citation network related to high-energy physics phenomenology.
6. **Tencent-alpha**: A real dynamic graph of daily capital transactions on Tencent.
7. **Tencent-beta**: Another real dynamic graph from Tencent with more nodes.

Next, I will gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. The paper provides references for the datasets, particularly for the UCI, Bitcoin, AS733, HepTh, and HepPh datasets. I will extract these citations from the **References section** of the paper.

The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- **UCI Dataset**:

- **Bitcoin Dataset**:

- **Tencent-alpha and Tencent-beta**: The paper does not provide specific citations for these datasets, but they are described as real dynamic graphs of daily capital transactions on Tencent.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, along with their respective citations for proper attribution.
