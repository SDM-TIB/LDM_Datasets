To extract datasets from the research paper titled "RadioGAT: A Joint Model-based and Data-driven Framework for Multi-band Radiomap Reconstruction via Graph Attention Networks" by Xiaojie Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments using **ray-tracing datasets based on real-world environments**, which suggests that there are specific datasets involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental section** where the authors describe their methodology and the datasets used. In this section, they mention that they generated radiomap datasets using **OpenStreetMap** for ten different areas, which is a crucial detail. The paper also includes a **Table I** that lists parameters for these areas, including longitude, latitude, dimensions, and transmitter locations.

I will extract the relevant details about the datasets from **Table I**. The table provides the following information for each area:

1. **Area Index**: Identifies the dataset.
2. **Longitude and Latitude**: Geographic coordinates for each area.
3. **Length and Width**: Dimensions of the area in meters.
4. **Grid Size**: The size of each grid in the radiomap.
5. **Transmitter Locations**: Coordinates for multiple transmitters used in the experiments.

Now, I will compile the full citations for the datasets mentioned in the paper. The authors reference the use of **OpenStreetMap** for generating the radiomap datasets, which is a significant source. The citation for OpenStreetMap is:

- **OpenStreetMap**: OpenStreetMap contributors. *OpenStreetMap*. [Online]. Available: https://www.openstreetmap.org/

Additionally, the paper mentions that the radiomaps were generated using **ray tracing technology**, but it does not specify a particular dataset name for this technology. Therefore, I will note that the datasets are based on real-world environments sourced from OpenStreetMap.

Finally, I will summarize the datasets extracted from the paper:

1. **Dataset Name**: Radiomap datasets generated from OpenStreetMap.
   - **Description**: Ten radiomap datasets based on real-world environments, generated using ray tracing techniques.
   - **Citation**: OpenStreetMap contributors. *OpenStreetMap*. [Online]. Available: https://www.openstreetmap.org/

After gathering all this information, I will ensure that it is structured properly for any downstream processing or review.
