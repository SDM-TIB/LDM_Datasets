To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Region2Vec: Community Detection on Spatial Networks Using Graph Embedding with Node Attributes and Spatial Interactions" by Yunlei Liang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research but may not specify datasets. The introduction often discusses the context and may mention data sources.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of community detection in spatial networks and hint at the use of specific datasets but do not name them yet. 

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly **section 2.2 (Data)**, where the authors explicitly describe the data sources used for their experiments. Here, they mention two key datasets:

1. **SafeGraph business venue database**: This dataset contains over 8 million points of interest (POIs) with visit patterns in the U.S. It is used to construct the spatial flow network by aggregating place visits to the census tract level.

2. **U.S. Census American Community Survey (ACS) 2015-2019 5-year estimates**: This dataset provides demographic features such as poverty population, race/ethnicity, and household income, which are used as node attributes in the model.

I will also check the **references section** to find full citations for these datasets. The SafeGraph database is referenced as a source but does not have a formal citation in the references section. However, I can note its website for reference:

- **SafeGraph business venue database**: SafeGraph. *SafeGraph Business Venue Database*. Available at: https://www.safegraph.com.

For the **U.S. Census American Community Survey**, the citation is typically formatted as follows:

- **U.S. Census Bureau**. *American Community Survey 2015-2019 5-Year Estimates*. Available at: https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their descriptions and citations. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research paper, along with their proper citations for future reference or processing.
