To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Improving Paratope and Epitope Prediction by Multi-Modal Contrastive Learning and Interaction Informativeness Estimation" by Zhiwei Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract highlights the use of both sequence and structure data for predicting paratopes and epitopes, which suggests that datasets are involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges in predicting paratopes and epitopes and mention the importance of utilizing multi-modal data. This indicates that they likely used specific datasets to train and evaluate their model.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used. They mention collecting data from the **Structural Antibody Database (SAbDab)**, which contains 7571 antibody-antigen complexes. They also detail the preprocessing steps taken, including removing high-homology sequences and compiling a final dataset of 626 binding antibody-antigen pairs, which includes sequences, structures, and interaction maps.

Now, I will look for the **full citations** for the datasets mentioned. The authors reference the following:

1. **Structural Antibody Database (SAbDab)**: This is a publicly accessible database from which they collected their data. The citation for this database is:
   > Dunbar, J., et al. *SAbDab: The Structural Antibody Database*. Nucleic Acids Research, 2014.

2. **CD-HIT**: This tool was used for clustering sequences. The citation for CD-HIT is:
   > Li, W., & Godzik, A. *Cd-hit: A fast program for clustering and comparing large sets of protein or nucleotide sequences*. Bioinformatics, 22(13), 1658-1659, 2006.

3. **PDB (Protein Data Bank)**: The authors mention using structural data in PDB format. The citation for PDB is:
   > Berman, H. M., et al. *The Protein Data Bank*. Nucleic Acids Research, 28(1), 235-242, 2000.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as specified. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
