To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Urban Region Embedding via Multi-View Contrastive Prediction" by Zechen Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on two downstream tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved. I will look for specific mentions of datasets in these sections.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of urban sensory data, including human trajectories and points-of-interest (POIs), which indicates that these types of data may be used in their experiments. 

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. They mention collecting data from NYC Open Data and using the Manhattan borough as the study area. The paper states that they partitioned Manhattan into 270 regions and utilized various datasets, including:

1. **Taxi Trip Records**: The authors specify that they used complete taxi trip records from February 2014, which amounts to 10 million taxi trips.

2. **POI Data**: They mention using NYC check-in and POI data, which includes 10,000 POIs categorized into 244 categories.

3. **Check-in Data**: The paper also refers to 100,000 check-in records that were used for model training and the popularity prediction task.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **NYC Open Data**, the citation is:
  > NYC Open Data. *New York City Open Data*. Available at: https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us.

- For the **taxi trip records**, the citation is:
  > NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission. *Taxi Trip Records*. Available at: https://www1.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/taxi-trip-records.page.

- For the **POI data**, the citation is:
  > Yang, D., Zhang, D., Zheng, V. W., and Yu, Z. (2014). *Modeling user activity preference by leveraging user spatial temporal characteristics in LBSNs*. IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems, 45(1): 129â€“142.

With these details in hand, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research.
