To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CADC: Encoding User-Item Interactions for Compressing Recommendation Model Training Data" by Hossein Entezari Zarch et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and it mentions the use of user-item interactions, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors discuss the importance of deep learning recommendation models (DLRMs) and the challenges associated with large training datasets. They mention that their approach, Collaborative Aware Data Compression (CADC), is tested on specific datasets, which I need to identify.

In the **experimental setup section**, the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments:

1. **MovieLens 1M**: This dataset contains 1 million ratings from users on movies, which is commonly used for evaluating recommendation algorithms.
2. **MovieLens 10M**: A larger version of the MovieLens dataset, containing 10 million ratings, also widely used in recommendation system research.
3. **Epinions**: A dataset containing user reviews and ratings for various products, which is another standard benchmark in recommendation systems.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **MovieLens 1M**, the citation is:
  > GroupLens Research. *MovieLens 1M Dataset*. Available at: https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/1m/

- For **MovieLens 10M**, the citation is:
  > GroupLens Research. *MovieLens 10M Dataset*. Available at: https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/10m/

- For **Epinions**, the citation is:
  > Alchemy. *Epinions Dataset*. Available at: https://alchemy.cs.washington.edu/data/epinions/

Having gathered the dataset names and their respective citations, I will now prepare to compile this information into a structured format for further use or analysis. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their sources as presented in the research paper.
