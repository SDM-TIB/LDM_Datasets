To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Predict Misinformation Spread with Stance-Aware GNNs" by Zihan Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract states that the model is evaluated on a "real-world dataset comprising 21 million tweets from 26,000 threads, linked to 13,000 fact-checked claims." This indicates that there is a significant dataset involved, which I need to explore further.

Next, I will look into the **methodology** and **experiment** sections, particularly focusing on the parts where the authors describe their experimental setup. In the **experiment section**, they mention using the **MuMiN dataset**, which consists of three subsets totaling 13,000 fact-checked claims and 21 million tweets. This is a crucial dataset for my extraction.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the MuMiN dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:
> Nielsen, D. S., & McConville, R. (2022). MuMiN: A Large-Scale Multilingual Multimodal Fact-Checked Misinformation Social Network Dataset. Proceedings of the 45th International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval, 3141â€“3153.

Now, I will summarize the dataset information:

1. **MuMiN Dataset**: This dataset is a large-scale multilingual multimodal dataset that includes 21 million tweets linked to 13,000 fact-checked claims. It is used to evaluate the stance-aware GNN model's performance.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that highlights the dataset's name, description, and citation, ensuring that all details are accurately represented for future reference or processing.
