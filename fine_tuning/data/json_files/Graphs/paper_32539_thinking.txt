To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Self-Supervised Representation Learning with Cross-Context Learning between Global and Hypercolumn Features" by Zheng Gao et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets used for evaluation or training.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors often discuss the context of their work and may mention datasets that are relevant to their research. I will look for phrases that indicate the use of specific datasets.

In the **experiments section**, I will pay close attention to any subsections that detail the datasets used for training and evaluation. This section typically contains the most comprehensive information about the datasets, including their names, sizes, and any relevant characteristics.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access the datasets.

From the paper, I expect to find the following datasets mentioned:

1. **ImageNet-1k**: A widely used dataset for image classification tasks, consisting of 1,000 classes and over a million images.
   - Citation:

2. **PASCAL VOC**: A dataset used for object detection and segmentation, containing images with annotated objects.
   - Citation:
     > Mark Everingham, Luc Van Gool, Christopher KI Williams, John Winn, and Andrew Zisserman. *The pascal visual object classes (voc) challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 88(2):303–338, 2010.

3. **COCO**: A large-scale dataset for object detection, segmentation, and captioning, containing images with complex scenes.
   - Citation:
     > Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, Serge Belongie, James Hays, Pietro Perona, Deva Ramanan, Piotr Dollár, and C. Lawrence Zitnick. *Microsoft coco: Common objects in context*. In Computer Vision – ECCV 2014, pages 740–755, Cham, 2014.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.
