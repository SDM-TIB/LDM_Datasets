To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Tabular Data Contrastive Learning via Class-Conditioned and Feature-Correlation Based Augmentation" by Wei Cui et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of a specific dataset for experiments, which is a good starting point.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention the challenges of tabular data and the need for effective learning algorithms, but they do not specify any datasets yet. I will continue to the **methodology and experiments sections** to find more concrete references.

In **section 4 (Experiments)**, the authors state that they conducted extensive experiments on the **OpenML-CC18 dataset**. This is a clear indication of a dataset being used. I will look for further details about this dataset in the text.

The paper provides a brief description of the **OpenML-CC18 dataset**, indicating that it is a collection of various tabular datasets used for benchmarking machine learning algorithms. However, I need to find the full citation for this dataset.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the complete citation for the **OpenML-CC18 dataset**. The citation is as follows:
> Bischl, B., Casalicchio, G., Feurer, M., Gijsbers, P., Hutter, F., Lang, M., Mantovani, R. G., van Rijn, J. N., and Vanschoren, J. *OpenML benchmarking suites*. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems Datasets and Benchmarks Track, 2021.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the findings:

1. **OpenML-CC18 Dataset**: This dataset is used for evaluating the proposed methods in the paper. It consists of a collection of tabular datasets that serve as benchmarks for machine learning tasks.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
