To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Strategic Responses to Personalized Pricing and Demand for Privacy: An Experiment" by In치cio B칩 et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental design sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on consumer behavior in response to personalized pricing, but it does not specify any datasets.

Next, I will examine the **experimental design section** in detail. This section describes the methodology used in the study, including the surveys and the data collection process. The authors mention that they collected responses from participants through the Prolific platform, which indicates that the data used in the study is derived from this platform.

In the **training sample subsection**, the authors specify that they collected data from 804 responses, which were used to develop a personalized pricing model. This indicates that the dataset consists of survey responses related to risk preferences and movie genre ratings.

I will also look for any specific datasets mentioned in the **results section**. However, the paper primarily discusses the findings based on the collected data rather than referencing external datasets.

Since the paper does not cite any external datasets but rather relies on the data collected through their own experimental design, I will document the dataset as follows:

1. **Prolific Platform Dataset**: This dataset consists of responses collected from participants on the Prolific platform, focusing on their risk preferences and movie genre ratings. The total number of responses collected for the training sample is 804.

Now, I will retrieve the full citation for the paper itself, as it serves as the primary source for the dataset:

- In치cio B칩, Li Chen, Rustamdjan Hakimov. *Strategic Responses to Personalized Pricing and Demand for Privacy: An Experiment*. April 2023.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry and its citation into a structured format for clarity and future reference. This will ensure that the dataset is properly attributed to the authors and the source of the data collection is clear.
