To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards User-Driven Neural Machine Translation" by Huan Lin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions the introduction of a novel framework and a new dataset called **UDT-Corpus**, which is a clear indication that a dataset is present. I will note this down as it is likely to be the primary dataset discussed in the paper.

Next, I will look into **section 3 (User-Driven Translation Dataset)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the UDT-Corpus. Here, they describe the dataset as containing 57,639 inputs from 6,550 users, with 17,099 Chinese sentences annotated with their English translations. This section will provide me with the necessary details about the dataset, including its size, structure, and purpose.

I will also check the **data collection and preprocessing** subsection to understand how the dataset was created and any specific characteristics it may have. This will help me provide a comprehensive description of the dataset.

After gathering the details about UDT-Corpus, I will then refer to the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. Since UDT-Corpus is a new dataset introduced in this paper, I will cite the paper itself as the source of the dataset.

The citation for the UDT-Corpus will be:
> Huan Lin, Liang Yao, Baosong Yang, Dayiheng Liu, Haibo Zhang, Weihua Luo, Degen Huang, Jinsong Su. *Towards User-Driven Neural Machine Translation*. In Proceedings of the 2023 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), pages XX-XX, 2023.

Now that I have the necessary information about the dataset, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring to include the dataset name, description, and the full citation. This will allow me to present the information in a structured manner for further processing or review.
