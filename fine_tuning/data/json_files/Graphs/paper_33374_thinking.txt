To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Weighted K-Center Algorithm for Data Subset Selection" by Srikumar Ramalingam et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of vision datasets such as CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet, indicating that these datasets are likely used in the experiments.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for any additional context or details about the datasets. The introduction mentions the reliance on large labeled datasets for training deep learning models, which reinforces the importance of the datasets mentioned in the abstract.

I will then focus on the **experiments section**, specifically looking for a subsection that details the datasets used. In this paper, the authors explicitly mention using the following datasets:

1. **CIFAR-10**: A dataset containing 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class.
2. **CIFAR-100**: Similar to CIFAR-10 but with 100 classes containing 600 images each.
3. **ImageNet**: A large-scale dataset with millions of images categorized into thousands of classes, widely used for image classification tasks.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:

- For **CIFAR-10** and **CIFAR-100**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky et al. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009.

- For **ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > O. Russakovsky, J. Deng, H. Su, et al. *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2015.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will prepare to format this information according to the required structure for downstream processing or review.
