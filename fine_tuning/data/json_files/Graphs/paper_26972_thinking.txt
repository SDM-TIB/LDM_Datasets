To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Survey on Contrastive Self-Supervised Learning" by Ashish Jaiswal et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are mentioned or implied. The abstract discusses self-supervised learning and mentions various tasks but does not specify datasets. The introduction elaborates on the challenges of supervised learning and hints at the use of large datasets but does not name any specific datasets yet.

Next, I will examine the **experiments and results sections** to find any explicit mentions of datasets used in the studies referenced. In the **benchmarks section**, the authors mention several datasets used for evaluation, including:

1. **ImageNet**: A large-scale dataset commonly used for image classification tasks.
2. **Places**: A dataset for scene recognition.
3. **Pascal VOC**: A dataset frequently used for object detection tasks.
4. **UCF-101**: A dataset for action recognition in videos.
5. **HMDB-51**: Another dataset for action recognition.
6. **Kinetics**: A dataset for video classification tasks.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with sources for further exploration.

The full citations I will extract are:

- For **ImageNet**:

  > Joao Carreira and Andrew Zisserman. *Quo vadis, action recognition? A new model and the kinetics dataset*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 6299–6308, 2017.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets referenced in the paper, which is essential for anyone looking to replicate or build upon the research.
