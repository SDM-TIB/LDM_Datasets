To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Uncertainty-Autoencoder-Based Privacy and Utility Preserving Data Type Conscious Transformation" by Bishwas Mandal et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. In the abstract, the authors mention testing their framework on several datasets, which indicates that there are specific datasets to identify. The introduction will provide additional context and possibly the names of these datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **experiments**. In this paper, the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments, which are:

1. **MNIST**: A well-known dataset of handwritten digits.
2. **Fashion MNIST**: A dataset of fashion articles, serving as a drop-in replacement for MNIST.
3. **UCI Adult**: A dataset containing demographic information for adults, often used for classification tasks.
4. **US Census Demographic Data**: Data from the American Community Survey, which includes various demographic features.

I will then verify the details of each dataset mentioned in the **experiments section** to ensure I have the correct context and usage.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations I need to extract are:

- For **MNIST**:
  > Y. LeCun, C. Cortes, and C. Burges. "Mnist handwritten digit database." ATT Labs [Online]. Available: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist, vol. 2, 2010.

- For **Fashion MNIST**:
  > H. Xiao, K. Rasul, and R. Vollgraf. "Fashion-mnist: a novel image dataset for benchmarking machine learning algorithms." 2017.

- For **UCI Adult**:
  > D. Dua and C. Graff. "UCI machine learning repository." 2017. [Online]. Available: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml

- For **US Census Demographic Data**:
  > "US Census Demographic Data," https://www.kaggle.com/muonneutrino/us-census-demographic-data#acs2017_census_tract_data.csv, Last accessed on 2020-4-24.

Now that I have gathered the dataset names and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly presents each dataset along with its citation.

This process ensures that I accurately capture the datasets used in the research, along with their proper citations, which is crucial for any further analysis or referencing.
