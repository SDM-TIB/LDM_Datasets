To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Optimization of Heterogeneous Systems with AI Planning Heuristics and Machine Learning: A Performance and Energy Aware Approach" by Suejb Memeti and Sabri Pllana, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or data sources.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Heterogeneous Systems and Applications)**, where the authors describe the systems and applications used for their experiments. This section is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets utilized in their evaluations.

In **subsection 2.2 (Applications)**, the authors describe two applications: the Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC) and parallel pattern matching. I will look for any specific datasets mentioned in relation to these applications. For instance, they mention using a real-world human DNA sequence obtained from the GenBank sequence database, which is a crucial dataset for the pattern matching application.

I will also check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. For the DNA sequence dataset, I will look for the citation related to the GenBank database.

The relevant datasets identified are:

1. **Human DNA Sequence Dataset**: This dataset is described as a real-world human DNA sequence obtained from the GenBank sequence database of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). 

The citation for this dataset is:
> National Center for Biotechnology Information. GenBank. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank, 2015. Accessed: Dec. 2015.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will ensure that the datasets are properly documented and can be referenced in future work or analyses.
