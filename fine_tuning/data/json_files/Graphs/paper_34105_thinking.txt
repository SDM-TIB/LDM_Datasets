To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Dynamic Analyses of Contagion Risk and Module Evolution on the SSE A-Shares Market Based on Minimum Information Entropy" by Muzi Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the Shanghai Stock Exchange (SSE) A-shares market and the time period of their study (2005 to 2018). They mention using daily stock returns, which indicates that the dataset is based on historical stock price data.

Next, I will look for specific details about the dataset in the **methodology section**. Here, the authors describe how they constructed the stock network and the data used for their analysis. They mention that they used the SSE A-shares market's weekly closing prices and that they filtered the dataset to include 716 stocks after excluding those with missing values or other issues.

I will also check the **results and discussion sections** to see if the authors provide any additional insights or references to the dataset, but the primary details are likely already captured in the methodology.

Now, I will compile the full citation for the dataset used in the study. The dataset is based on:

- **SSE A-shares Market Data**: This dataset includes weekly closing prices of stocks traded on the Shanghai Stock Exchange from 2005 to 2018, focusing on 716 stocks after filtering.

The full citation for the dataset is not explicitly provided in the paper, but I can reference the source of the data as follows:

> Wind Database. *SSE A-shares Market Historical Data*. Accessed December 18, 2019.

Finally, I will summarize the dataset information in a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the dataset as it is crucial for proper attribution and future reference.
