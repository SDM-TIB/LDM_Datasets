To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Contrastive Representation Learning for Gaze Estimation" by Swati Jindal and Roberto Manduchi, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the use of a multi-view gaze dataset (EVE) for training, which indicates that there is at least one dataset to extract.

Next, I will look for specific sections that discuss datasets in detail. In this paper, the **experiments section** (specifically section 3.1) discusses the EVE dataset used for training the GazeCLR framework. It states that the EVE dataset contains video sequences captured from four calibrated and synchronized cameras, which is crucial information for understanding the dataset's structure and purpose.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the EVE dataset. The paper cites the EVE dataset as follows:
- For the EVE dataset, the citation is:
  > Park, S., Aksan, E., Zhang, X., & Hilliges, O. (2020). *Towards end-to-end video-based eye-tracking*. In European conference on computer vision (pp. 747–763). Springer.

Additionally, the paper mentions two other datasets used for evaluation: **MPIIGaze** and **Columbia**. I will look for their descriptions in the experiments section and then find their citations in the references.

For the **MPIIGaze dataset**, the citation is:
- For MPIIGaze, the citation is:
  > Zhang, X., Sugano, Y., Fritz, M., & Bulling, A. (2015). *Appearance-based gaze estimation in the wild*. In Proceedings of the IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition (pp. 4511–4520).

For the **Columbia dataset**, the citation is:
- For Columbia, the citation is:
  > Smith, B. A., Yin, Q., Feiner, S. K., & Nayar, S. K. (2013). *Gaze locking: passive eye contact detection for human-object interaction*. In Proceedings of the 26th annual ACM symposium on User interface software and technology (pp. 271–280).

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will summarize the findings:

1. **EVE Dataset**: A multi-view gaze dataset used for training GazeCLR, containing synchronized video sequences from four cameras.
   - Citation: Park, S., Aksan, E., Zhang, X., & Hilliges, O. (2020). *Towards end-to-end video-based eye-tracking*. In European conference on computer vision (pp. 747–763). Springer.

2. **MPIIGaze Dataset**: A dataset used for evaluation, containing images captured from various subjects for gaze estimation.
   - Citation: Zhang, X., Sugano, Y., Fritz, M., & Bulling, A. (2015). *Appearance-based gaze estimation in the wild*. In Proceedings of the IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition (pp. 4511–4520).

3. **Columbia Dataset**: Another dataset used for evaluation, known for its high head pose variations.
   - Citation: Smith, B. A., Yin, Q., Feiner, S. K., & Nayar, S. K. (2013). *Gaze locking: passive eye contact detection for human-object interaction*. In Proceedings of the 26th annual ACM symposium on User interface software and technology (pp. 271–280).

With this information, I can now compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
