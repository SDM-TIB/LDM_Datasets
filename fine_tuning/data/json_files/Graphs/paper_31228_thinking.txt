To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Few-shot Detection of Anomalies in Industrial Cyber-Physical System via Prototypical Network and Contrastive Learning" by Haili Sun et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on **two public imbalanced datasets with few-shot settings**, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used. In this case, they mention using **UNSW-NB15** and **NSL-KDD** datasets for their experiments. I will look for detailed descriptions of these datasets, including their characteristics and the context in which they were used.

From the text, I find the following details about the datasets:

1. **UNSW-NB15**: This dataset was created by the Intelligent Security Group of Australia and consists of network packets with 49 features, including various types of network attacks. The dataset contains 175,341 training records and 82,332 test records.

2. **NSL-KDD**: This is an improved version of the KDD CUP99 dataset, which contains 41 features and aims to address the inherent problems of the original dataset. It includes 125,973 training records and 22,544 test records.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **UNSW-NB15**, the citation is:
  > Moustafa, N., & Slay, J. (2016). The evaluation of network anomaly detection systems: Statistical analysis of the UNSW-NB15 data set, and the comparison with the KDD99 dataset. *Information Security Journal: A Global Perspective*, 25, 18-31.

- For **NSL-KDD**, the citation is:
  > Tavallaee, M., Bagheri, E., Lu, W., & Ghorbani, A. (2009). A Detailed Analysis of the KDD CUP 99 Data Set. In *Second IEEE Symposium on Computational Intelligence for Security and Defense Applications (CISDA)*.

With this information, I can now summarize the datasets and their citations clearly.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
