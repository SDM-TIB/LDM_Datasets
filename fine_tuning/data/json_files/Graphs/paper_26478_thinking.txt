To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Predictively Encoded Graph Convolutional Network for Noise-Robust Skeleton-based Action Recognition" by Jongmin Yu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors conducted experiments using the **NTU-RGB+D** and **Kinetics-Skeleton** datasets, which indicates that these are the primary datasets used in their research.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (section 4) to confirm the details about these datasets. In section 4.1, the authors describe the **NTU-RGB+D dataset** as one of the largest datasets for skeleton-based action recognition, containing around 56,000 samples captured using Microsoft Kinect v2. They also mention the **Kinetics-Skeleton dataset**, which is derived from the Kinetics dataset and contains 34,000 video clips.

I will then check the **appendices** for any additional details about the datasets. In Appendix A.2, the authors provide further descriptions of both datasets, including their structure and the types of data they contain. This information will help in accurately describing the datasets.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset from the **References section** of the paper:

1. **NTU-RGB+D Dataset**:
   - Citation:
     > Shahroudy, A., Liu, J., Ng, T.T., & Wang, G. (2016). *NTU RGB+D: A large scale dataset for 3D human activity analysis*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pp. 1010â€“1019.

2. **Kinetics-Skeleton Dataset**:
   - Citation:
     > Kay, W., Carreira, J., Simonyan, K., et al. (2017). *The Kinetics human action video dataset*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1705.06950.

With these citations in hand, I will now compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described accurately and includes the full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for any further processing or review.
