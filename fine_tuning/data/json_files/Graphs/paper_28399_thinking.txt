To extract datasets from the research paper titled "3D Infomax improves GNNs for Molecular Property Prediction" by Hannes Stark et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the datasets referenced. The abstract mentions the use of existing 3D molecular datasets for pre-training, which indicates that there are specific datasets that will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any relevant sections that discuss the datasets used for pre-training and evaluation. In this paper, the relevant information is likely to be found in sections that describe the methodology or experiments.

Upon reviewing the **experiments section**, I will identify the datasets explicitly mentioned for pre-training and fine-tuning. The paper lists three main datasets used for pre-training:

1. **QM9 Dataset**: This dataset contains 134,000 small organic molecules with 3D coordinates and quantum mechanical properties.
2. **GEOM-Drugs Dataset**: This dataset consists of 304,000 drug-like molecules with multiple conformers and is annotated with ensemble Gibbs free energy.
3. **QMugs Dataset**: This dataset includes 665,000 drug-like molecules, each with three diverse conformers and multiple conformer-specific quantum mechanical properties.

Next, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations I find are:

- For **QM9**:
  > Ramakrishnan, R., Dral, P. O., Rupp, M., & von Lilienfeld, O. A. (2014). Quantum chemistry structures and properties of 134 kilo molecules. *Scientific Data*, 1(1), 140022.

- For **GEOM-Drugs**:
  > Axelrod, S., & Gomez-Bombarelli, R. (2020). Geom: Energy-annotated molecular conformations for property prediction and molecular generation. *arXiv preprint arXiv:2006.05531*.

- For **QMugs**:
  > Isert, C., Atz, K., Jim√©nez-Luna, J., & Schneider, G. (2021). QMugs: Quantum mechanical properties of drug-like molecules. *arXiv preprint arXiv:2106.10234*.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will summarize the information for each dataset, ensuring to include the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that can be used for further processing or review.
