To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Rehabilitation Exercise Quality Assessment through Supervised Contrastive Learning with Hard and Soft Negatives" by Mark Karlov et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on three publicly available rehabilitation exercise assessment datasets, which suggests that these datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they specifically mention three datasets:

1. **University of Idaho-Physical Rehabilitation Movement Data (UI-PRMD)**: This dataset includes 10 exercise types performed by 10 healthy subjects, with body-joint data collected using the Kinect sensor at 30 frames per second. The dataset is balanced and features a uniform sample distribution across exercise types.

2. **IntelliRehabDS (IRDS)**: This dataset contains 9 exercise types performed by 15 patients and 14 healthy subjects, with body-joint data also collected using the Kinect One sensor at 30 fps. The dataset has an imbalanced distribution of samples across exercise types.

3. **KInematic assessment of MOvement and clinical scores for remote monitoring of physical REhabilitation (KIMORE)**: This dataset consists of 5 exercises performed by healthy subjects and patients with motor dysfunctions, with body-joint data collected using the Kinect One sensor at 30 fps. The dataset presents challenges due to its regressive nature and limited data availability.

To ensure accuracy, I will cross-reference these datasets with the **References section** to obtain their full citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **UI-PRMD**, the citation is:

- For **IRDS**, the citation is:

- For **KIMORE**, the citation is:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their full citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
