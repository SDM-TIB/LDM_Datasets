To extract datasets from the research paper titled "PassGoodPool: Joint Passengers and Goods Fleet Management with Reinforcement Learning aided Pricing, Matching, and Route Planning" by Kaushik Manchella et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for simulations or experiments. 

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this paper, the authors mention using real-world taxi-trip and goods-order datasets for their simulations. This indicates that there are specific datasets that I need to identify.

In the **appendices**, particularly Appendix A, the authors provide details about the datasets. They mention using the **New York City taxi trip dataset** and extracting trips from May and June for their simulations. They also describe how they simulated package delivery requests using customer check-in traffic data from Google Maps, which is another dataset of interest.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the references section:

1. **New York City Taxi Trip Dataset**:
   - Citation: 
     > TLC, “NYC Taxi Limousine Commission - Trip Record Data.” Available: https://www1.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page, 2018.

2. **Google Maps Check-in Traffic Data**:
   - While the paper does not provide a specific citation for the Google Maps data, it is important to note that this data is derived from Google Maps analytics and is used to generate synthetic workloads for the simulation.

After identifying these datasets and their citations, I will compile the information into a structured format that highlights each dataset's name, description, and citation. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research paper for future reference or analysis.
