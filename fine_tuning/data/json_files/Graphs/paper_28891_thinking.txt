To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Overcoming Oversmoothness in Graph Convolutional Networks via Hybrid Scattering Networks" by Frederik Wenkel et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for experiments.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. This is often where authors describe the datasets they used, including their characteristics and how they were utilized in the study.

In this paper, I will specifically check for any references to datasets in the following sections:

1. **Introduction**: Authors may mention datasets to provide context for their research.
2. **Methods/Experiments**: This section typically contains detailed descriptions of the datasets, including their names, sizes, and any relevant characteristics.
3. **Results**: Sometimes, datasets are discussed in the context of the results obtained, which can provide additional insights into their significance.

Once I identify the datasets, I will ensure to note down their names and any relevant details provided by the authors. For example, if the authors mention a dataset like "Cora" or "Pubmed," I will look for specific details such as the number of nodes, edges, features, and any other pertinent information.

After gathering the dataset names and details, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial as it allows for proper attribution and further exploration of the datasets if needed.

For instance, if the paper mentions the "Cora" dataset, I will look for its citation, which might be something like:
> McCallum, A., & Nigam, S. (2002). *A comparison of event models for Naive Bayes text classification*. In Proceedings of the AAAI-98 Workshop on Learning for Text Categorization (Vol. 752, pp. 41-48).

Finally, I will compile all the extracted information, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This structured approach will help in accurately documenting the datasets used in the research paper.
