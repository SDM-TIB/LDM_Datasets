To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Expanding Label Sets for Graph Convolutional Networks" by Mustafa CoÅŸkun et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The introduction discusses the application of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) and mentions that the authors tested their methods on three large-scale real-world networks. This indicates that datasets are likely included in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methods or experimental results sections**. In this paper, the authors provide a table (Table 1) that lists the datasets used for their experiments, which includes:

1. **Cora Dataset**: A citation network with 5,429 nodes, 4,732 edges, 7 classes, and 1,433 features.
2. **CiteSeer Dataset**: Another citation network with 2,708 nodes, 3,327 edges, 6 classes, and 3,703 features.
3. **PubMed Dataset**: A dataset with 19,717 nodes, 44,338 edges, 3 classes, and 500 features.

I will confirm the details of these datasets by cross-referencing them with the **experimental setup section** where the authors describe their methodology and the datasets used for benchmarking.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** for full citations. The paper cites the datasets as follows:

- For the **Cora Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Sen, P., Namata, G., Bilgic, M., Getoor, L., Galligher, B., & Eliassi-Rad, T. (2008). Collective classification in network data. *AI Magazine*, 29(3), 93-93.

- For the **CiteSeer Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Sen, P., Namata, G., Bilgic, M., Getoor, L., Galligher, B., & Eliassi-Rad, T. (2008). Collective classification in network data. *AI Magazine*, 29(3), 93-93.

- For the **PubMed Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Sen, P., Namata, G., Bilgic, M., Getoor, L., Galligher, B., & Eliassi-Rad, T. (2008). Collective classification in network data. *AI Magazine*, 29(3), 93-93.

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
