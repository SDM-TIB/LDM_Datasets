To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DiffSRL: Learning Dynamical State Representation for Deformable Object Manipulation with Differentiable Simulation" by Sirui Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions benchmarking the performance of their methods on **PlasticineLab**, which suggests that this is a dataset used in their experiments.

Next, I will look for specific details about the dataset in the **experiments section**. In this section, the authors state that they evaluated their model on **six single object manipulation tasks from the PlasticineLab benchmark**. This indicates that the PlasticineLab is indeed a dataset, but I need to gather more information about it.

I will also check the **related work section** and **methodology** to see if there are any additional datasets mentioned or if there are references to how the PlasticineLab dataset was created or structured. However, the primary focus seems to be on the PlasticineLab dataset.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citation for the PlasticineLab dataset. The paper cites the PlasticineLab benchmark as follows:
> Z. Huang, Y. Hu, T. Du, S. Zhou, H. Su, J. B. Tenenbaum, and C. Gan. *Plasticinelab: A soft-body manipulation benchmark with differentiable physics*. In ICLR, 2021.

Since the authors primarily use the PlasticineLab dataset for their experiments, I will ensure to include this dataset in my final output.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citation for the PlasticineLab dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
