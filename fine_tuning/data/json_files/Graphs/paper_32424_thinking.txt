To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Chatbot Application to Support Smart Agriculture" by Paweena Suebsombut et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to look for any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the chatbot application and its functions, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any references to data sources or datasets used in the study. The introduction discusses the concept of smart agriculture and the role of IoT technologies but does not specify any datasets.

Moving on to the **proposed chatbot application section**, I will look for any mention of data collection or datasets used to support the chatbot's functionality. The paper describes the chatbot's capabilities in providing crop cultivation recommendations and monitoring systems, but again, it does not explicitly mention any datasets.

In the **implementation results and discussion section**, the authors describe the implementation of the LINE chatbot for lettuce cultivation in Chiang Mai, Thailand. They mention that the chatbot provides information and recommendations based on data collected from sensors and IoT technologies. However, there is no specific dataset mentioned by name.

Finally, I will check the **references section** to see if any cited works include datasets or data sources relevant to the study. The references include various studies related to IoT and agriculture, but they do not provide specific datasets used in the current research.

After reviewing the entire paper, it appears that while the authors discuss the use of data and technology in smart agriculture, they do not explicitly name or provide citations for any datasets. Therefore, I will conclude that there are no specific datasets to extract from this paper.

In summary, I will document my findings as follows:
- No specific datasets were identified in the paper.
- The authors discuss the use of data from sensors and IoT technologies but do not provide explicit dataset names or citations.

This thorough examination ensures that I have accurately captured the information presented in the paper regarding datasets.
