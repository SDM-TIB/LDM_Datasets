To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Automating Style Analysis and Visualization with Explainable AI - Case Studies on Brand Recognition" by Yu-hsuan Chen, Levent Burak Kara, and Jonathan Cagan, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and case study sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the research involves two case studies on brand recognition, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of data scarcity in brand recognition tasks, hinting at the need for datasets. They mention the use of parametric modeling and vectorization from existing datasets, which suggests that they have utilized specific datasets for their experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly the **data representation and acquisition** subsection. Here, the authors describe two approaches for data acquisition: one involves synthesizing a dataset of phone designs, and the other involves vectorizing images from a pixel-based dataset. 

1. **Synthetic Phone Dataset**: The authors mention generating a synthetic SVG dataset with 20,000 synthetic phones, with 10,000 for both Apple and Samsung. This dataset is created through parameter interpolation based on shape rules derived from existing models.

2. **HK Comp Cars Dataset**: The authors state that they used the HK Comp cars dataset, which is the largest brand- and orientation-labeled car dataset, for their car case study. This dataset includes images of various car brands and is essential for their analysis.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Synthetic Phone Dataset**, since it is generated from existing models, I will cite the source of the original models used for parameter interpolation. The original dataset is from Dimensions.com, but the specific citation is not provided in the text.

- For the **HK Comp Cars Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yang, L., Luo, P., Loy, C. C., & Tang, X. (2015). *A Large-Scale Car Dataset for Fine-Grained Categorization and Verification*. Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 3973â€“3981.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets utilized in the research.
