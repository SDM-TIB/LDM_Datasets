To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ARMA Nets: Expanding Receptive Field for Dense Prediction" by Jiahao Su et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to find any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors demonstrate the effectiveness of ARMA networks on "challenging dense prediction tasks including video prediction and semantic segmentation," which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, they mention two specific tasks: pixel-level video prediction and semantic segmentation. I will look for any dataset names associated with these tasks.

Upon reviewing the experiments, I find the following datasets mentioned:

1. **Moving-MNIST-2 Dataset**: This dataset is used for pixel-level video prediction. It consists of videos generated by moving two digits from the MNIST dataset within a black canvas. The authors specify that they generated 10,000 training videos, 3,000 validation videos, and 5,000 test videos, each containing 20 frames.

2. **ISIC 2018 Dataset**: This dataset is used for semantic segmentation tasks, specifically for skin lesion analysis. The dataset contains 2,594 images, which are resized to 224 × 224 pixels. The authors mention that they split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets.

Now, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Moving-MNIST-2 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Github repo. *Moving-MNIST-2 dataset*. https://github.com/jthsieh/DDPAE-video-prediction/blob/master/data/moving_mnist.py. [Online; accessed 05-Jan-2020].

- For the **ISIC 2018 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Codella, N. C. F., Gutman, D., Celebi, M. E., Helba, B., Marchetti, M. A., Dusza, S. W., Kalloo, A., Liopyris, K., Mishra, N., Kittler, H., et al. *Skin lesion analysis toward melanoma detection: A challenge at the 2017 international symposium on biomedical imaging (ISBI), hosted by the international skin imaging collaboration (ISIC)*. In 2018 IEEE 15th International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI 2018), pages 168–172. IEEE, 2018.

With these citations in hand, I will compile the dataset entries for the Moving-MNIST-2 and ISIC 2018 datasets, ensuring to include the full citations as required.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ready for review or further processing.
