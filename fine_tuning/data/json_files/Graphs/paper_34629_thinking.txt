To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The Oxford Olympics Study 2024: Are Cost and Cost Overrun at the Games Coming Down?" by Alexander Budzier and Bent Flyvbjerg, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the paper is an update and extension of previous studies, which suggests that it may reference historical datasets related to Olympic costs and overruns.

Next, I will look for specific **tables and figures** that present data. In this paper, **Table 1** provides a comprehensive overview of the outturn costs of the Olympic Games from 1960 to 2024, including the number of athletes and events. This table is crucial as it contains quantitative data that can be categorized as a dataset.

I will also examine **Table 3 and Table 4**, which detail cost overruns for the Olympic Games, both in nominal and real terms. These tables present specific figures for each Olympic event, which are essential for understanding trends in cost overruns.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to ensure I can provide full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper references previous studies and reports that may contain the original datasets or methodologies used to compile the data.

For example, the original dataset for the cost and cost overrun analysis is likely derived from the work of Flyvbjerg et al. (2016), which is cited multiple times throughout the paper. The citation for this foundational study is:
> Flyvbjerg, B., Stewart, A., and Budzier, A. (2016). *The Oxford Olympics Study 2016: Cost and cost overrun at the games*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1607.04484.

Additionally, I will note that the paper discusses the methodology for measuring costs and cost overruns, which may reference datasets from the Olympic World Library and other sources.

Once I have gathered all the relevant datasets and their citations, I will compile them into a structured format for further processing or review. This will ensure that all extracted datasets are accurately represented and properly cited.
