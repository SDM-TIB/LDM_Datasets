To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-behavior Graph Contextual Aware Network for Session-based Recommendation" by Lingfei Wu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on three public benchmark datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed present in the paper. I will note this down as a starting point.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this case, I find that in **section 5 (Experiments)**, the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. They mention:

1. **Yoochoose 1/64**: Derived from the RecSys Challenge 2015, this dataset contains user actions on an e-commerce website over six months, including click and buy interactions.

2. **Yoochoose 1/4**: Another dataset from the RecSys Challenge 2015, similar to Yoochoose 1/64 but with a larger set of user actions.

3. **Tmall**: This dataset contains anonymous shopping logs from the Tmall online shopping platform, featuring multiple interaction types such as click, add-to-favorite, and buy.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the **references section** of the paper. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

- For **Yoochoose**, the citation is:
  > "Yoochoose Dataset." RecSys Challenge 2015. Available at: http://2015.recsyschallenge.com/challege.html

- For **Tmall**, the citation is:
  > "Tmall Dataset." IJCAI-15 competition. Available at: https://tianchi.aliyun.com/dataset/dataDetail?dataId=42

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **Yoochoose 1/64**: A dataset containing user actions on an e-commerce website over six months, including click and buy interactions.
   - Citation: "Yoochoose Dataset." RecSys Challenge 2015. Available at: http://2015.recsyschallenge.com/challege.html

2. **Yoochoose 1/4**: A larger dataset derived from the same source as Yoochoose 1/64, containing user actions on an e-commerce platform.
   - Citation: "Yoochoose Dataset." RecSys Challenge 2015. Available at: http://2015.recsyschallenge.com/challege.html

3. **Tmall**: A dataset of anonymous shopping logs from the Tmall online shopping platform, featuring multiple interaction types.
   - Citation: "Tmall Dataset." IJCAI-15 competition. Available at: https://tianchi.aliyun.com/dataset/dataDetail?dataId=42

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited.
