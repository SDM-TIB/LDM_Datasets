To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Graph Neural Networks for Channel Decoding" by Sebastian Cammerer et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, results, and conclusion sections** to look for any references to datasets. The abstract mentions benchmarking the proposed decoder against various coding schemes, which suggests that datasets may be involved, but I need to find specific names.

Next, I will check the **introduction** for any explicit mentions of datasets. The authors discuss the use of forward error correction (FEC) codes and mention benchmarking against state-of-the-art methods, but I need to find specific datasets used for these benchmarks.

In the **results section**, the authors present performance evaluations for different codes, including BCH and LDPC codes. However, they do not explicitly mention datasets used for training or testing. I will also look for any references to datasets in the **methodology** section, where they describe the training process and the types of codes used.

After thoroughly reviewing the paper, I will consult the **References section** to find any citations related to datasets. If the authors refer to specific datasets or benchmark studies, I will extract the full citations for those datasets.

If I find any datasets mentioned, I will ensure to document them with their full citations. For example, if they refer to a specific BCH code or LDPC code, I will look for the original papers that introduced those codes and provide the citations accordingly.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including their names and full citations, into a structured format for easy reference. If no specific datasets are mentioned, I will note that as well.

In summary, my steps will include:
1. Reading through the abstract, introduction, methodology, results, and conclusion sections for mentions of datasets.
2. Checking the references for any dataset citations.
3. Documenting any identified datasets with their full citations.
4. Compiling the information for clarity and future use.
