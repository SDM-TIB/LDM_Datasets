To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Incorporating simulated spatial context information improves the effectiveness of contrastive learning models" by Lizhen Zhu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention key datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **results section**, where the authors typically discuss the datasets used for their experiments in detail. In this case, the authors describe three primary datasets generated from simulated environments: **House14K**, **House100K**, and **Apt14K**. They also mention variations of these datasets that include different lighting conditions, specifically **House14KLighting** and **House100KLighting**.

I will then look for a **dedicated section on datasets** or any mention of dataset generation processes, which often provides additional context about how the datasets were created and their characteristics. The paper describes how these datasets were generated using the ThreeDWorld platform, capturing images from a simulated environment with specific parameters.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets that are based on prior work or that have been published previously. In this case, the datasets are generated specifically for this study, so I will focus on documenting them as described in the paper.

The datasets I will extract and document are:

1. **House14K**: A dataset containing approximately 14,000 images captured in a simulated house environment.
2. **House100K**: A larger dataset with approximately 100,000 images from the same environment, providing more extensive coverage.
3. **Apt14K**: A dataset containing approximately 14,000 images from a simulated apartment environment.
4. **House14KLighting**: A variation of the House14K dataset that includes images captured under different lighting conditions.
5. **House100KLighting**: A variation of the House100K dataset that also includes images captured under different lighting conditions.

Now, I will compile the full citations for these datasets based on the information provided in the paper. Since these datasets are newly created for this research, I will cite them as follows:

- Zhu, L., Wyble, B., & Wang, J. Z. (2024). *Datasets for the article “Incorporating simulated spatial context information improves the effectiveness of contrastive learning models”*. OSF. https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/W98GQ.

With this information, I will be ready to create structured entries for each dataset, ensuring that I include the full citation as required.
