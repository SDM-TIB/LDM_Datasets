To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Instance-wise Hard Negative Example Generation for Contrastive Learning in Unpaired Image-to-Image Translation" by Weilun Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on three benchmark datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiment)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they explicitly mention three datasets:

1. **Cityscapes Dataset**: This dataset contains a diverse set of images recorded in street scenes with high-quality pixel-level annotations. It is commonly used for semantic urban scene understanding.

2. **Cat→Dog Dataset**: This dataset consists of 10,000 high-quality images of cat and dog faces extracted from the AFHQ dataset, used for image translation tasks.

3. **Horse→Zebra Dataset**: This dataset includes approximately 2,500 images of horses and zebras in various scenes, also utilized for image translation.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **Cityscapes Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Marius Cordts, Mohamed Omran, Sebastian Ramos, Timo Rehfeld, Markus Enzweiler, Rodrigo Benenson, Uwe Franke, Stefan Roth, and Bernt Schiele. *The Cityscapes Dataset for Semantic Urban Scene Understanding*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 3213–3223, 2016.

- For the **Cat→Dog Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yunjey Choi, Youngjung Uh, Jaejun Yoo, and Jung-Woo Ha. *Stargan: Unified Generative Adversarial Networks for Multi-Domain Image-to-Image Translation*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 8789–8797, 2018.

- For the **Horse→Zebra Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Jun-Yan Zhu, Taesung Park, Phillip Isola, and Alexei A. Efros. *Unpaired Image-to-Image Translation Using Cycle-Consistent Adversarial Networks*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 2223–2232, 2017.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
