To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Georacle: Enabling Geospatially Aware Smart Contracts" by Taha Azzaoui, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and data model sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract discusses the Georacle service and its capabilities, but I need to look for specific datasets that support these claims.

In the **introduction**, the author emphasizes the importance of geospatial data for decentralized applications and mentions the need for access to such data on-chain. However, I need to find specific datasets that are referenced.

Next, I will focus on the **data model section**, where the author discusses the OpenStreetMap (OSM) project. This section provides insights into the types of geospatial data that can be utilized, such as nodes, ways, and tags. The OSM data model is a crucial component of the Georacle service, and I will consider it as a dataset.

I will also check the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The key dataset identified is:

1. **OpenStreetMap (OSM)**: This is a community-driven project that provides open access to high-quality geospatial data. The citation for the OSM dataset is:
   > OpenStreetMap contributors. *Planet dump*. Retrieved from https://planet.osm.org, 2017.

Since the paper primarily discusses the use of OpenStreetMap data without introducing additional datasets, I will focus on this dataset for my documentation.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring that I include the full citation for the OpenStreetMap dataset as required. This will provide a clear and concise reference for anyone looking to understand the data sources used in the Georacle service.
