To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Self-Supervised Dynamic Graph Representation Learning via Temporal Subgraph Contrast" by Linpu Jiang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that experiments were conducted on five real-world datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, particularly **subsection 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors provide a summary of the datasets used. Here, they list five datasets along with brief descriptions:

1. **fb-forum**: A forum network similar to Facebook, with directed edges indicating user interactions over time.
2. **soc-sign-bitcoinalpha**: A trust network among users trading on the Bitcoin Alpha platform, with directed edges indicating trust relationships.
3. **soc-wiki-elec**: Contains voting data from Wikipedia administrator elections, with directed edges indicating votes cast.
4. **ia-movielens-user2tags-10m**: A bipartite network representing tagging behaviors of MovieLens users, with directed edges indicating user tags on movies.
5. **sx-mathoverflow-c2q**: A temporal interaction network from the Stack Exchange website Math Overflow, with directed edges indicating comments on questions.

After identifying the datasets, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The paper provides citations for the datasets as follows:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations.
