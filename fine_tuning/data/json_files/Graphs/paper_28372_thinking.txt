To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Applying Differential Privacy to Tensor Completion" by Zheng Wei et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets, which indicates that there are datasets involved, but it does not specify their names.

Next, I will move to the **introduction** section. Here, the authors mention that their experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of their proposed methods on both synthetic and real-world datasets. However, specific dataset names are still not provided.

I will then check the **evaluation** section, particularly **section 5**, where the authors describe their experiments. In **section 5.1 (Simulation Study)**, they mention generating a tensor for CP decomposition and Tucker decomposition but do not specify a dataset name. However, in **section 5.2 (Empirical Study on ML-100K)**, they explicitly state that they analyze the performance of their methods on the **MovieLens 100K (ML-100K)** dataset, which consists of 943 users and 1682 movies.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the MovieLens 100K dataset. The citation provided in the references is:
> F Maxwell Harper and Joseph A Konstan. *The movielens datasets: History and context*. ACM Transactions on Interactive Intelligent Systems (TiiS), 5(4):1â€“19, 2015.

Since the paper mentions both synthetic datasets and the MovieLens 100K dataset, I will document the MovieLens dataset with its citation, while noting that the synthetic datasets are not explicitly named or cited.

Finally, I will compile the extracted dataset information, ensuring to include the full citation for the MovieLens 100K dataset as required.
