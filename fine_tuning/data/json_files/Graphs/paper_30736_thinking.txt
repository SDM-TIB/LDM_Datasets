To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On Narrative Information and the Distillation of Stories" by Dylan R. Ashley et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the use of the **FMA dataset** for experiments, which indicates that this dataset is significant to the research.

Next, I will examine **section 3 (Experiments on Music Albums)**, where the authors explicitly state that they selected the **FMA dataset (Defferrard et al., 2017)** as it is the largest open dataset that includes raw audio files. This section provides a clear identification of the dataset used in their experiments.

I will also look for any additional datasets mentioned in the paper. However, the focus appears to be solely on the FMA dataset for the experiments conducted. 

Now, I will consult the **References section** to retrieve the full citation for the FMA dataset:

- For the **FMA dataset**, the citation is:
  > Defferrard, M., Benzi, K., Vandergheynst, P., & Bresson, X. (2017). FMA: a dataset for music analysis. Proceedings of the 18th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference, 316â€“323. https://ismir2017.smcnus.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/75%5C_Paper.pdf

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets, I will compile the information regarding the FMA dataset into a structured format for clarity.

After completing this process, I will ensure that the dataset entry is ready for review or further processing, focusing on the importance of including the full citation for the dataset.
