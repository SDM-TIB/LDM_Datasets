To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Tackling Over-Smoothing for General Graph Convolutional Networks" by Wenbing Huang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions "experimental evaluations on simulated dataset" and "extensive experiments on several real benchmarks," indicating that datasets are indeed involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors discuss their evaluations. In this section, they specifically mention four datasets used for their experiments:

1. **Cora Dataset**: A citation network dataset with 2,708 nodes, 5,429 edges, and 7 classes. It contains 1,433 features per node and is used for transductive learning.

2. **Citeseer Dataset**: Another citation network dataset with 3,327 nodes, 4,732 edges, and 6 classes. Each node has 3,703 features, and it is also used for transductive learning.

3. **Pubmed Dataset**: This dataset consists of 19,717 nodes, 44,338 edges, and 3 classes. Each node has 500 features, and it is used for transductive learning.

4. **Reddit Dataset**: A social network dataset with 232,965 nodes, 11,606,919 edges, and 41 classes. Each node has 602 features, and this dataset is used for inductive learning.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The Cora, Citeseer, and Pubmed datasets are commonly referenced in the literature, and I can retrieve their citations from well-known sources. The Reddit dataset is also widely used and can be cited accordingly.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

- **Cora Dataset**: 
  > Sen, P., Namata, G., Bilgic, M., Getoor, L., Galligher, B., & Eliassi-Rad, T. (2008). Collective classification in network data. *AI Magazine*, 29(3), 93.

- **Citeseer Dataset**: 
  > Sen, P., Namata, G., Bilgic, M., Getoor, L., Galligher, B., & Eliassi-Rad, T. (2008). Collective classification in network data. *AI Magazine*, 29(3), 93.

- **Pubmed Dataset**: 
  > Sen, P., Namata, G., Bilgic, M., Getoor, L., Galligher, B., & Eliassi-Rad, T. (2008). Collective classification in network data. *AI Magazine*, 29(3), 93.

- **Reddit Dataset**: 
  > Hamilton, W., Ying, Z., & Leskovec, J. (2017). Inductive representation learning on large graphs. In *Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems* (pp. 1024-1035).

Now, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all relevant information is captured accurately for further processing or review.
