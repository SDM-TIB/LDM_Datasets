To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Non-Exemplar Semi-Supervised Class-Incremental Learning" by Wenzhuo Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are referenced. The abstract mentions that experiments were conducted on benchmark datasets, which indicates that specific datasets will be discussed later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors describe their experimental setup in **Section 5**, where they mention using four benchmark datasets: **CIFAR-100**, **ImageNet-100**, **miniImageNet**, and **CUB-200**. 

I will take note of the details provided for each dataset, including the number of labeled and unlabeled samples used in the experiments. The paper specifies the following:

1. **CIFAR-100**: This dataset is widely used in class-incremental learning literature, containing 100 classes with 500 labeled images per class.
2. **ImageNet-100**: A subset of the larger ImageNet dataset, specifically tailored for the experiments.
3. **miniImageNet**: Another commonly used dataset in few-shot learning, consisting of 60 classes with 600 images.
4. **CUB-200**: A dataset focused on bird species, containing 200 classes with various images per class.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to guide readers to the original sources. 

The full citations I will extract are:

- **CIFAR-100**:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton, et al. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. 2009.

- **ImageNet-100**:
  > Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, and Li Fei-Fei. *ImageNet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In 2009 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 248–255. IEEE, 2009.

- **miniImageNet**:
  > Oriol Vinyals, Charles Blundell, Timothy Lillicrap, Daan Wierstra, et al. *Matching networks for one shot learning*. Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 29, 2016.

- **CUB-200**:
  > Arslan Chaudhry, Marc’Aurelio Ranzato, Marcus Rohrbach, and Mohamed Elhoseiny. *Efficient lifelong learning with a-gem*. In International Conference on Learning Representations, 2019.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this into a structured format for further processing or review.
