To extract datasets from the research paper titled "THREATRACE: Detecting and Tracing Host-based Threats in Node Level Through Provenance Graph Learning" by Su Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to identify any datasets that are mentioned. The abstract states that THREATRACE is evaluated on **three public datasets**, which indicates that there are specific datasets to look for.

Next, I will focus on **section VI (Evaluation)**, where the authors discuss the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they mention three datasets:

1. **StreamSpot Dataset**: This dataset is described as containing 500 benign graphs and 100 attack graphs, with specific details about the average number of nodes and edges in both benign and attack scenes.

2. **Unicorn SC-2 Dataset**: This dataset is noted as being more complex than the StreamSpot dataset and is used to compare THREATRACE's performance against other detectors. The authors provide details about the average number of nodes and edges in benign and attack scenes.

3. **DARPA TC Dataset**: This dataset is generated from a red-team vs. blue-team engagement and includes provenance data from various systems. The authors provide a detailed overview of the number of benign and abnormal nodes, as well as the number of edges.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

- For the **StreamSpot Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Streamspot data. (2016). Retrieved from https://github.com/sbustreamspot/sbustreamspot-data.

- For the **Unicorn SC-2 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > X. M. Han. (2019). shellshock-apt. Retrieved from https://github.com/margoseltzer/shellshock-apt.

- For the **DARPA TC Dataset**, the citation is:
  > A. D. Keromytis. (2018). Transparent computing engagement 3 data release. Retrieved from https://github.com/darpa-i2o/Transparent-Computing/blob/master/README-E3.md.

Now, I will compile the information about each dataset, including their descriptions and citations, into a structured format for further processing or review.
