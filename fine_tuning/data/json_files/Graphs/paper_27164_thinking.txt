To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Consolidated Dataset and Metrics for High-Dynamic-Range Image Quality" by Aliaksei Mikhailiuk et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates the creation of a **Unified Photometric Image Quality dataset (UPIQ)**, which suggests that there are specific datasets being referenced.

Next, I will focus on **section IV (Unified Photometric IQA Dataset)**, where the authors describe the datasets included in UPIQ. They mention that they selected four existing datasets to create UPIQ:

1. **TID2013 Dataset**: This is a standard dynamic range (SDR) dataset used for image quality assessment, containing various images with different distortion types.

2. **LIVE Dataset**: Another SDR dataset that includes images with subjective quality ratings.

3. **Korshunov Dataset**: This dataset contains high dynamic range (HDR) images and is used for assessing HDR image quality.

4. **Narwaria Dataset**: Similar to the Korshunov dataset, this also contains HDR images and is used for quality assessment.

In the paper, the authors provide a summary of these datasets, including their characteristics and the number of images they contain. I will ensure to note down the specific details provided for each dataset.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each of these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and will include the authors, title, publication venue, and year of publication.

For example, the citations I will look for might include:

- For **TID2013 Dataset**:
  > Ponomarenko, N., Jin, L., Ieremeiev, O., Lukin, V., Egiazarian, K., Astola, J., & Benoit. (2015). *Image database TID2013: Peculiarities, results and perspectives*. Signal Processing: Image Communication, 30, 57-77.

- For **LIVE Dataset**:
  > Sheikh, H. R., Sabir, M., & Bovik, A. C. (2006). *A Statistical Evaluation of Recent Full Reference Image Quality Assessment Algorithms*. IEEE Transactions on Image Processing, 15(11), 3440-3451.

- For **Korshunov Dataset**:
  > Korshunov, P., Hanhart, P., Richter, T., Artusi, A., Mantiuk, R., & Ebrahimi, T. (2015). *Subjective quality assessment database of HDR images compressed with JPEG XT*. In Proceedings of the 2015 Seventh International Workshop on Quality of Multimedia Experience (QoMEX), 1-6.

- For **Narwaria Dataset**:
  > Narwaria, M., Da Silva, M. P., Le Callet, P., & Pepion, R. (2013). *Tone-mapping-based high-dynamic-range image compression: study of optimization criterion and perceptual quality*. Optical Engineering, 52(10).

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This structured approach will help in accurately extracting and documenting the datasets from the research paper.
