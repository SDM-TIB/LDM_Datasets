To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Characterizing Long-Tail Categories on Graphs" by Haohui Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. In the abstract, the authors mention "extensive experiments on various real-world datasets," which indicates that datasets are involved, but I need to find their specific names.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors provide details about the datasets used for evaluation. They mention six datasets:

1. **Cora-Full**: A citation network dataset where each node represents a paper, and edges represent citation relationships. The dataset is used for node classification based on research topics.

2. **BlogCatalog**: A social network dataset where nodes represent bloggers and edges represent friendships. Node attributes are generated from Deepwalk.

3. **Email**: A network constructed from email exchanges within a research institution, where nodes represent members and edges represent email communications.

4. **Wiki**: A network dataset of Wikipedia pages, where nodes represent pages and edges denote hyperlinks between them.

5. **Amazon-Clothing**: A product network containing products in the "Clothing, Shoes and Jewelry" category on Amazon, where nodes represent products and edges are based on substitutable relationships.

6. **Amazon-Electronics**: Similar to Amazon-Clothing, but for products in the "Electronics" category, with nodes representing products and edges based on complementary relationships.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are typically provided in the context of the datasets' original publications or descriptions. 

For example, the citation for **Cora-Full** is:
> Bojchevski, A., & GÃ¼nnemann, S. (2018). Deep Gaussian Embedding of Graphs: Unsupervised Inductive Learning via Ranking. In International Conference on Learning Representations.

The citation for **BlogCatalog** is:
> Tang, L., & Liu, H. (2009). Relational Learning via Latent Social Dimensions. In Proceedings of the 15th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining.

I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described with its name, a brief description, and the full citation. 

After gathering all the necessary information, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format that is ready for review or further processing.
