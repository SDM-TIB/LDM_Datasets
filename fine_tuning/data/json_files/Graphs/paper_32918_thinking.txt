To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Local Graph Limits Perspective on Sampling-Based GNNs" by Yeganeh Alimohammadi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions empirical results on node classification tasks on large citation graphs, which indicates that datasets are likely discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors describe their empirical validation on two datasets: **PubMed** and **ogbn-mag**. I will note the details provided about these datasets, including their characteristics and the context in which they were used.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide specific information about the datasets:
1. **PubMed**: A citation network with approximately 20,000 nodes.
2. **ogbn-mag**: A heterogeneous citation network with 1,939,743 nodes, focusing on the paper-to-paper citation graph.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. 

For **PubMed**, the citation is:
> Hu, W., Fey, M., Zitnik, M., Dong, Y., Ren, H., Liu, B., Catasta, M., and Leskovec, J. *Open graph benchmark: Datasets for machine learning on graphs*. Neural Inform. Process. Syst., 33:22118–22133, 2020.

For **ogbn-mag**, the citation is:
> Hu, W., Fey, M., Zitnik, M., Dong, Y., Ren, H., Liu, B., Catasta, M., and Leskovec, J. *Open graph benchmark: Datasets for machine learning on graphs*. Neural Inform. Process. Syst., 33:22118–22133, 2020.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that highlights each dataset's name, description, and citation. This will ensure that the extraction is clear and comprehensive, making it easy for others to reference the datasets used in this research.
