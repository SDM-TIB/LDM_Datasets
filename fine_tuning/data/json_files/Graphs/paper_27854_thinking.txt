To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Plan2Scene: Converting Floorplans to 3D Scenes" by Madhawa Vidanapathirana et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and data sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the creation of indoor surface texture datasets and the augmentation of a dataset of floorplans and photos, indicating that multiple datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **Data section** (section 4), where the authors describe the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention three key datasets:

1. **Rent3D++ Dataset**: This is an extended version of the original Rent3D dataset, which consists of floorplans and photos from 215 apartments. The authors detail how they corrected and annotated the dataset, which is crucial for understanding its structure and use.

2. **Stationary Textures Dataset**: This dataset contains 516 texture exemplars for four substance types: wood, plaster, carpet, and tile. The authors explain how they curated this dataset from various online texture libraries, which is important for texture synthesis in their approach.

3. **Substance-Mapped Textures Dataset**: This dataset consists of 146 seamless textures from various substances, curated for texture retrieval purposes. The authors provide details about the sources of these textures, which is essential for proper citation.

After identifying these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **Rent3D Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Chenxi Liu, Alex Schwing, Kaustav Kundu, Raquel Urtasun, and Sanja Fidler. *Rent3D: Floor-plan priors for monocular layout estimation*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2015.

- For the **Stationary Textures Dataset**, since it is a curated dataset from various online sources, I will note that the authors mention specific texture libraries but do not provide a single citation. Instead, I will summarize the sources:
  > Curated from various online texture libraries including Pexels, SketchUp Texture Club, Freepik, and 3D Jungle.

- For the **Substance-Mapped Textures Dataset**, the citation is:
  > ArchiveTextures. *ArchiveTextures.net*. [Online resource].

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, which is crucial for reproducibility and further research in this area.
