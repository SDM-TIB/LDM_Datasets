To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Sentence Representations via Gaussian Embedding" by Shohei Yoda et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on natural language inference (NLI) tasks, which typically involve specific datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 3) where the authors describe their evaluation methodology. In **subsection 3.1 (NLI Task)**, they explicitly mention using three datasets for evaluation:

1. **Stanford NLI (SNLI)**: This dataset contains approximately 570,000 sentence pairs, where each pair consists of a premise and a hypothesis labeled as "entailment," "neutral," or "contradiction." The authors reference the original paper for this dataset.

2. **Multi-Genre NLI (MNLI)**: This dataset includes around 430,000 sentence pairs, constructed similarly to SNLI but with a broader range of styles and topics. The authors also cite the original paper for this dataset.

3. **SICK**: This dataset consists of about 10,000 sentence pairs, with premise sentences derived from image descriptions and hypothesis sentences generated through specific rules. The authors provide a citation for this dataset as well.

I will then check the **References section** to gather the full citations for each dataset:

- For **Stanford NLI (SNLI)**, the citation is:
  > Samuel R. Bowman, Gabor Angeli, Christopher Potts, and Christopher D. Manning. *A large annotated corpus for learning natural language inference*. In Proceedings of the 2015 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), pages 632–642.

- For **Multi-Genre NLI (MNLI)**, the citation is:
  > Adina Williams, Nikita Nangia, and Samuel Bowman. *A Broad-Coverage Challenge Corpus for Sentence Understanding through Inference*. In Proceedings of the 2018 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies (NAACL), pages 1112–1122.

- For **SICK**, the citation is:
  > Marco Marelli, Stefano Menini, Marco Baroni, Luisa Bentivogli, Raffaella Bernardi, and Roberto Zamparelli. *A SICK cure for the evaluation of compositional distributional semantic models*. In Proceedings of the Ninth International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC), pages 216–223.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented and properly cited as per the requirements.
