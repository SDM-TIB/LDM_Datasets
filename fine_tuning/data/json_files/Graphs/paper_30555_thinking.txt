To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Search to Pass Messages for Temporal Knowledge Graph Completion" by Zhen Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions conducting extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 3) where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they mention three datasets:

1. **ICEWS14**: This dataset is described as a subset of the Integrated Crisis Early Warning System (ICEWS) database, with specific statistics provided in the appendix.

2. **ICEWS05-15**: Another subset of the ICEWS database, this dataset covers a different time span and is also detailed in the appendix.

3. **GDELT**: This dataset is a subset of the Global Database of Events, Language, and Tone (GDELT), containing facts from a specified time period.

To ensure I have the correct citations, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **ICEWS14** and **ICEWS05-15**, the citation is:
  > Alberto García-Durán, Sebastijan Dumančić, and Mathias Niepert. *Learning sequence encoders for temporal knowledge graph completion*. In Proceedings of the 2018 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 4816–4821, Brussels, Belgium, 2018.

- For **GDELT**, the citation is:
  > Kalev Leetaru and Philip A Schrodt. *Gdelt: Global data on events, location, and tone, 1979–2012*. In ISA annual convention, volume 2, pages 1–49, 2013.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes the full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
