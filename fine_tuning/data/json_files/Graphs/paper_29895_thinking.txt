To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Sudowoodo: Contrastive Self-supervised Learning for Multi-purpose Data Integration and Preparation" by Runhui Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract discusses the importance of large-scale, high-quality labeled datasets for various data integration and preparation tasks, which suggests that datasets will be a key focus of the paper.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. This section typically provides detailed information about the datasets used for evaluation. I will pay close attention to any tables or figures that summarize dataset statistics, as these often contain valuable information about the datasets.

In the **experiments section**, I find that the authors evaluate Sudowoodo on several datasets for entity matching (EM) and data cleaning. They mention five datasets for EM, which are:

1. **Abt-Buy (AB)**: This dataset consists of two tables with a total of 1,092 and 1,081 records, respectively, and has a positive match ratio of 10.7%.
2. **Amazon-Google (AG)**: This dataset includes 3,226 records in one table and 2,294 in another, with a positive match ratio of 10.2%.
3. **DBLP-ACM (DA)**: This dataset has 2,616 records in both tables, with a positive match ratio of 18.0%.
4. **DBLP-Scholar (DS)**: This dataset consists of 1,363 records in one table and 64,263 in another, with a positive match ratio of 18.6%.
5. **Walmart-Amazon (WA)**: This dataset includes 2,554 records in one table and 22,074 in another, with a positive match ratio of 9.4%.

I will also check the **data cleaning section** for additional datasets. The authors mention using four benchmark datasets for data cleaning, which are:

1. **Beers**: A dataset with 2,410 rows and 11 attributes, containing various error types.
2. **Hospital**: A dataset with 1,000 rows and 20 attributes, also containing multiple error types.
3. **Rayyan**: A dataset with 1,000 rows and 11 attributes.
4. **Tax**: A dataset with 5,000 rows and 15 attributes.

After identifying these datasets, I will look in the **References section** for full citations. The paper cites various sources for the datasets used, and I will ensure to extract the complete citation for each dataset.

For example, the citation for the **Abt-Buy dataset** might be:
> A. Doan, A. Y. Halevy, and Z. G. Ives. "Principles of Data Integration." Morgan Kaufmann, 2012.

I will repeat this process for each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring that I accurately capture the full citation details.

Finally, I will compile all the extracted datasets along with their citations into a structured format for easy reference and further analysis.
