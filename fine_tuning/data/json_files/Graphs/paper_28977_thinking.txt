To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Instance-wise algorithm configuration with graph neural networks" by Romeo Valentin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and method sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors compiled a large dataset of solver performance for various configurations and MILP instances, which suggests that there is a dataset involved.

Next, I will focus on the **method section**, where the authors describe their approach in detail. They mention collecting a dataset of triplets (i, c, γic), where 'i' represents MILP instances, 'c' represents configurations, and 'γic' is the primal-dual integral after running the solver. This indicates that they have created a dataset specifically for their experiments.

In the **results section**, the authors refer to three problem benchmarks: **item placement**, **load balancing**, and **anonymous**. They mention that the first two benchmarks contain 10,000 industrially-sized MILP instances for training and validation, while the anonymous benchmark contains only 117 instances. This provides specific details about the datasets used in their experiments.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The authors do not provide specific citations for the datasets themselves, but they reference the original papers related to the benchmarks:

1. For the **item placement** and **load balancing** datasets, they do not provide a specific citation, but I can infer that these datasets are likely derived from standard benchmarks in the field of combinatorial optimization.

2. For the **anonymous dataset**, the authors mention that it contains instances from diverse sources, but again, no specific citation is provided.

Since the paper does not provide explicit citations for the datasets, I will note that the datasets are based on common benchmarks in the field, but I will not be able to provide formal citations for them.

Finally, I will summarize the datasets extracted from the paper:

- **Item Placement Dataset**: Contains 10,000 industrially-sized MILP instances for training and validation.
- **Load Balancing Dataset**: Also contains 10,000 industrially-sized MILP instances for training and validation.
- **Anonymous Dataset**: Contains 117 instances that vary widely in size and are from diverse sources.

Since the paper does not provide specific citations for these datasets, I will note that they are based on common benchmarks in combinatorial optimization but will not include formal citations.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
