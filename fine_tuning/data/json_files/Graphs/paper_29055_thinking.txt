To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Understanding Contrastive Learning Requires Incorporating Inductive Biases" by Nikunj Saunshi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses experiments on image and text domains, which suggests that datasets are involved, but I need to find specific names.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors describe their experiments on the **CIFAR-10 dataset** for image classification and the **AG News dataset** for text classification. This is a clear indication that these datasets are used in their experiments.

Now, I will gather the necessary details about each dataset:

1. **CIFAR-10 Dataset**: This dataset is commonly used for image classification tasks and consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes, with 6,000 images per class.

2. **AG News Dataset**: This dataset contains news articles categorized into four classes: World, Sports, Business, and Science/Technology. It is widely used for text classification tasks.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **CIFAR-10 dataset**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. *CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets*. 2009.

- For the **AG News dataset**, the citation is:
  > Shayani Zhang, Junbo Zhao, and Yann LeCun. *Character-level convolutional networks for text classification*. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 2015.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations, ensuring that I have accurately documented the datasets used in the research paper.

This structured approach ensures that I capture all relevant information about the datasets while adhering to the importance of providing full citations for each dataset.
