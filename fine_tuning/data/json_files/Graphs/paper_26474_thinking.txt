To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Heterogeneous Relational Reasoning in Knowledge Graphs with Reinforcement Learning" by Mandana Saebi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that experiments were conducted on real-world datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Data & Metrics)**, as this section is likely to provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the experiments. Here, the authors list three datasets:

1. **NELL-995**: This dataset is described as containing 154,213 facts and 268 queries, with 1,152 entity types. It is noted for explicitly encoding entity types, which is significant for the study.

2. **Amazon Beauty**: This dataset includes 52,516 facts and 5,000 queries, with 200 entity types. It is part of the Amazon e-commerce collection and focuses on user-product relations.

3. **Amazon Cellphones**: Similar to the Amazon Beauty dataset, this one contains 31,034 facts and 5,000 queries, with 200 entity types, also focusing on user-product relations.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper. The authors reference the following sources:

- For **NELL-995**, the citation is:
  > Mitchell, T. M., & et al. (2018). *NELL: A system for learning to read and understand natural language*. In Proceedings of the 2018 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP).

- For the **Amazon datasets**, the citation is:
  > He, R., & McAuley, J. (2016). *Ups and downs: Modeling the visual evolution of fashion trends with one-class collaborative filtering*. In Proceedings of the 25th International Conference on World Wide Web (WWW).

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will summarize the information for each dataset, ensuring to include the full citation as required.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
