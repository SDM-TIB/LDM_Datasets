To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Know Your Neighbors: Improving Single-View Reconstruction via Spatial Vision-Language Reasoning" by Rui Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors achieve state-of-the-art results on the **KITTI-360** dataset and also evaluate their method on the **DDAD** dataset. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for their experiments.

Next, I will look into **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors typically provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used in their experiments. Here, I will find explicit mentions of the datasets, their characteristics, and how they are utilized in the study.

In **section 4.1**, the authors clearly state that they use the **KITTI-360** dataset for training and evaluation, which captures static scenes using multiple cameras. They also mention the **DDAD** dataset for evaluating zero-shot generalization capabilities. 

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the **References section** of the paper:

1. For the **KITTI-360 dataset**, the citation is:
   > Yiyi Liao, Jun Xie, and Andreas Geiger. *KITTI-360: A novel dataset and benchmarks for urban scene understanding in 2D and 3D*. IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 45(3):3292–3310, 2022.

2. For the **DDAD dataset**, the citation is:
   > Vitor Guizilini, Rares Ambrus, Sudeep Pillai, Allan Ravenatos, and Adrien Gaidon. *3D packing for self-supervised monocular depth estimation*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 2485–2494, 2020.

After collecting this information, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

- **KITTI-360**: A dataset designed for urban scene understanding, capturing static scenes with multiple cameras to facilitate learning full 3D shapes through self-supervision.
- **DDAD**: A dataset used to evaluate the zero-shot generalization capability of models trained on KITTI-360.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that is ready for review or further processing, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its full citation.
