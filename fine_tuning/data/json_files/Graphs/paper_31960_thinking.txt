To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SiCL: Silhouette-Driven Contrastive Learning for Unsupervised Person Re-Identification with Clothes Change" by Mingkun Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the proposed method is evaluated on **six benchmark datasets**, which indicates that I should look for a list of these datasets.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors provide details about the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they explicitly list the datasets as follows:

1. **DeepChange**: This dataset is described as having 178,407 images, with a training set of 75,083 images and a query set of 17,527 images. It is a benchmark for long-term person re-identification with clothes change.

2. **LTCC (Long-Term Clothes Change)**: This dataset contains 17,119 images, with 9,576 for training and 493 for querying. It is used for evaluating long-term person re-identification.

3. **PRCC (Person Re-Identification with Clothes Change)**: This dataset has 33,698 images, with 17,896 for training and 3,543 for querying. It focuses on clothes change scenarios.

4. **Celeb-ReID**: This dataset consists of 34,186 images, with 20,208 for training and 2,972 for querying. It is a benchmark for celebrity re-identification.

5. **Celeb-ReID-Light**: This smaller dataset contains 10,842 images, with 9,021 for training and 887 for querying. It is also focused on celebrity re-identification.

6. **VC-Clothes**: This dataset has 19,060 images, with 9,449 for training and 1,020 for querying. It is designed for evaluating clothes change in person re-identification.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
