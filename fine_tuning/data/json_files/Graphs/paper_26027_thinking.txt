To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Extrapolating paths with graph neural networks" by Jean-Baptiste Cordonnier and Andreas Loukas, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions experiments with **GPS traces on a road network** and **user-navigation paths in Wikipedia**, indicating that these might be datasets used in their experiments.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors describe two main tasks: extrapolating GPS traces and predicting user navigation in Wikipedia. I will focus on these tasks to identify the datasets used.

In **section 4.2 (GPS trace extrapolation)**, the authors mention using a dataset of **food deliveries** consisting of **229 traces** over the **OpenStreetMap** road network of Lausanne, which includes **18,156 nodes** and **32,468 edges**. This is a clear dataset that I need to document.

In **section 4.3 (User navigation in Wikipedia)**, the authors refer to the **Wikispeedia game** as the dataset for predicting user navigation paths. They cite a previous work that describes the game, which is crucial for the citation.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the **References section**:

1. For the **OpenStreetMap road network** dataset, the citation is:
   > OpenStreetMap contributors. *OpenStreetMap*. Available at: https://www.openstreetmap.org.

2. For the **Wikispeedia game**, the citation is:
   > Robert West, Joelle Pineau, and Doina Precup. *Wikispeedia: An online game for inferring semantic distances between concepts*. In IJCAI 2009, Proceedings of the 21st International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence, Pasadena, California, USA, July 11-17, 2009, pages 1598â€“1603, 2009.

After collecting this information, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

- **GPS Trace Dataset**: A dataset of food deliveries consisting of 229 traces mapped to the OpenStreetMap road network.
- **Wikispeedia Dataset**: A dataset derived from the Wikispeedia game, which involves predicting user navigation paths among Wikipedia articles.

Finally, I will ensure that I have the full citations ready for each dataset to maintain proper academic integrity and facilitate further research.

With all this information gathered, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for easy reference and future use.
