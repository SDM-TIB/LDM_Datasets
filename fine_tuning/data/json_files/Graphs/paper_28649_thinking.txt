To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CRIS: CLIP-Driven Referring Image Segmentation" by Zhaoqing Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that the experimental results are demonstrated on three benchmark datasets, which indicates that I should look for specific names and details of these datasets.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used in their experiments. Here, I will find the following datasets:

1. **RefCOCO**: This dataset is described as containing 19,994 images with 142,210 referring expressions for 50,000 objects, collected from the MSCOCO dataset. The dataset is split into training, validation, and test sets.

2. **RefCOCO+**: This dataset includes 141,564 language expressions with 49,856 objects in 19,992 images. It is noted that some absolute-location words are excluded, making it more challenging than RefCOCO.

3. **G-Ref**: This dataset consists of 104,560 referring expressions for 54,822 objects in 26,711 images. The expressions are collected from Amazon Mechanical Turk, and the average length of sentences is longer than in the other datasets.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **RefCOCO**, the citation is:
  > Sahar Kazemzadeh, Vicente Ordonez, Mark Matten, and Tamara Berg. *ReferItGame: Referring to objects in photographs of natural scenes*. In Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, 2014.

- For **RefCOCO+**, the citation is:
  > Sahar Kazemzadeh, Vicente Ordonez, Mark Matten, and Tamara Berg. *ReferItGame: Referring to objects in photographs of natural scenes*. In Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, 2014. (Note: RefCOCO+ is an extension of RefCOCO, so it shares the same citation.)

- For **G-Ref**, the citation is:
  > Varun K Nagaraja, Vlad I Morariu, and Larry S Davis. *Modeling context between objects for referring expression understanding*. In ECCV, 2016.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
