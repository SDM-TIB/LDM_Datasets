To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Road Disease Detection based on Latent Domain Background Feature Separation and Suppression" by Juwu Zheng and Jiangtao Ren, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on two road disease detection datasets, specifically **GRDDC** and **CNRDD**. This is a strong indication that these datasets are crucial to the research.

Next, I will look for more detailed descriptions of these datasets in the **experiments section**. The authors provide specific information about each dataset:

1. **GRDDC2020**: This dataset contains a training set and two test sets, with a total of 21,041 images in the training set and 2,631 images in test1 and 2,664 images in test2. It includes 9 disease categories collected from three different countries: Czech Republic, Japan, and India.

2. **CNRDD**: This dataset consists of 4,295 images of road asphalt pavement, with 3,022 images in the training set and 1,273 images in the test set. It includes 8 types of road diseases.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The paper cites the datasets as follows:

- For **GRDDC2020**, the citation is:
  > Arya, D., Maeda, H., Ghosh, S. K., et al. "Global road damage detection: State-of-the-art solutions." In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data), pp. 5533-5539, 2020.

- For **CNRDD**, the citation is:
  > Zhang, H., Wu, Z., Qiu, Y. "A New Road Damage Detection Baseline with Attention Learning." Applied Sciences, 12(15), 7594, June 2022.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this into a structured format for further processing or review.
