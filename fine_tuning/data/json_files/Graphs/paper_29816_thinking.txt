To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MultiSAGE: a multiplex embedding algorithm for inter-layer link prediction" by Luca Gallo, Vito Latora, and Alfredo Pulvirenti, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and data evaluation sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, but I need to look for specific datasets in the later sections.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of graph representation learning and mention various types of networks, but I need to find concrete examples of datasets.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Data and Evaluation)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention three multiplex networks:

1. **arXiv Multiplex Network**: This dataset is a collaboration network where each layer represents a different research topic from the arXiv preprint archive. It consists of 19,310 nodes and 13 layers, with 48,657 intra-layer connections and 20,738 inter-layer connections.

2. **Drosophila Multiplex Network**: This dataset represents protein-genetic interactions in the common fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. It has 11,867 nodes and 7 layers, with 40,228 intra-layer links and 5,173 inter-layer links.

3. **ff-tw-yt Multiplex Network**: This dataset is derived from Friendfeed, where users registered accounts on Twitter and YouTube. It consists of 11,827 nodes and 3 layers, with 74,815 intra-layer connections and 6,028 inter-layer connections.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **arXiv Multiplex Network**, the citation is:
  > J. Scott, “Social network analysis,” Sociology, vol. 22, no. 1, pp. 109–127, 1988.

- For the **Drosophila Multiplex Network**, the citation is:
  > C. Stark et al., “Biogrid: a general repository for interaction datasets,” Nucleic acids research, vol. 34, no. suppl 1, pp. D535–D539, 2006.

- For the **ff-tw-yt Multiplex Network**, the citation is:
  > M. E. Dickison, M. Magnani, and L. Rossi, *Multilayer Social Networks*. Cambridge University Press, 2016.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
