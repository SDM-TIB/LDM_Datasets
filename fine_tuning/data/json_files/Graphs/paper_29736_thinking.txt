To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Large-scale Subsurface Simulations with a Hybrid Graph Network Simulator" by Tailin Wu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the datasets used in the research. The abstract mentions the use of an "industry-standard subsurface flow dataset (SPE-10)" which indicates that a specific dataset is being utilized.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this case, the authors describe the dataset in detail in the **experiments section**. They specify that the dataset is a Single Porosity Single Permeability (SPSP) model, consisting of 20 trajectories, each with 61 time steps, and a grid size of 1.1 million cells.

I will note the following details about the dataset:
- **Dataset Name**: SPE-10
- **Description**: An industry-standard subsurface flow dataset used for evaluating the model's generalization capabilities. It consists of 20 trajectories, each with 61 time steps, and a grid size of 1.1 million cells.
- **Usage**: The dataset is used to assess the performance of the Hybrid Graph Network Simulator (HGNS) in predicting fluid dynamics in subsurface simulations.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the SPE-10 dataset. The reference indicates that it is part of the 10th SPE Comparative Solution Project, and I will format the citation accordingly.

The full citation for the dataset is:
> Sintef (2008). The 10th SPE Comparative Solution Project, Model 2. Available at: https://www.sintef.no/projectweb/geoscale/results/msmfem/spe10/.

Finally, I will compile the extracted dataset information, ensuring that I include the full citation as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the dataset used in the research paper.
