To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Pre-Training and Prompting for Few-Shot Node Classification on Text-Attributed Graphs" by Beining Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to gather initial insights about the datasets used. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on **six real-world TAGs**, which indicates that multiple datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental setup section** (Section 4.1) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they explicitly list the datasets and provide some statistics about them. The paper mentions two categories of datasets: **Open Graph Benchmark (OGB)** and **Amazon Review** datasets.

In the **Table 2**, the authors provide detailed statistics for the datasets:

1. **ogbn-arxiv**: A directed citation graph between all computer science (CS) ArXiv papers indexed by Microsoft Academic Graph (MAG).

2. **ogbn-products**: An undirected and unweighted graph representing an Amazon product co-purchasing network.

3. **Children**: A dataset composed of products related to children's items.
   - Citation: 
     > Yan, H., Li, C., Long, R., Yan, C., Zhao, J., Zhuang, W., Yin, J., Zhang, P., Han, W., & Sun, H. (2023). A comprehensive study on text-attributed graphs: Benchmarking and rethinking. In *NeurIPS*.

4. **History**: A dataset related to historical products.
   - Citation: 
     > Yan, H., et al. (2023). A comprehensive study on text-attributed graphs: Benchmarking and rethinking. In *NeurIPS*.

5. **Computers**: A dataset related to computer products.
   - Citation: 
     > Yan, H., et al. (2023). A comprehensive study on text-attributed graphs: Benchmarking and rethinking. In *NeurIPS*.

6. **Photo**: A dataset related to photographic products.
   - Citation: 
     > Yan, H., et al. (2023). A comprehensive study on text-attributed graphs: Benchmarking and rethinking. In *NeurIPS*.

After identifying the datasets and their citations, I will ensure that I have the correct format for each citation, as it is crucial for proper referencing.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ready for further processing or review.
