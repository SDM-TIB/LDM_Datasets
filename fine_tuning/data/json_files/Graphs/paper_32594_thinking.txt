To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Getting too personalized (personalized): The importance of feature choice in online adaptive algorithms" by ZhaoBin Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, results, and discussion sections** to locate any datasets that are explicitly referenced or described. The abstract mentions the use of **simulations** and **case studies using existing experimental results in ASSISTments**, which indicates that there may be datasets related to these simulations and case studies.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the use of multi-armed bandit (MAB) algorithms and mention that they will explore these issues through simulations. They also refer to **existing experimental results in ASSISTments**, suggesting that there is a dataset associated with this educational technology.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **methods section**. Here, the authors describe their approach to modeling student characteristics and outcomes. They mention using **experimental data** from ASSISTments, which is a key dataset for their analysis. I will note the details provided about this dataset, including how it was used in their simulations.

In the **results section**, the authors present findings based on the simulations and case studies. They refer to the **ASSISTments dataset** multiple times, indicating its importance in their research. I will ensure to capture any specific details about the dataset's structure, size, and the nature of the data collected.

Finally, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the ASSISTments dataset. The authors cite the following reference for the dataset:
> Selent, D., Patikorn, T., & Heffernan, N. (2016). ASSISTments dataset from multiple randomized controlled experiments. In Proceedings of the Third ACM Conference on Learning at Scale (pp. 181â€“184). ACM.

Now, I will compile the information I have gathered about the datasets into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the ASSISTments dataset as it is crucial for proper attribution and further research.

In summary, the key steps I will take are:
1. Read through the relevant sections of the paper to identify datasets.
2. Note specific mentions of the ASSISTments dataset and its usage in simulations.
3. Retrieve the full citation for the ASSISTments dataset from the references section.
4. Organize the information clearly for future reference or processing.
