To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Tackling the Challenges in Scene Graph Generation with Local-to-Global Interactions" by Sangmin Woo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the **Visual Genome dataset**, which is a strong indication that this dataset is used in the research.

Next, I will look for specific sections that detail the datasets used, such as **Section III (Identifying Challenges in Scene Graph Generation)** and **Section V (Experiments)**. In these sections, the authors discuss their analysis and experiments, which often include dataset descriptions.

In **Section III**, the authors analyze the **Visual Genome dataset** and mention its statistics, indicating that it is a primary dataset for their experiments. They also refer to a **Bidirectional Relationship (BR) dataset**, which is a subset of the Visual Genome dataset, specifically created to evaluate the model's understanding of relational direction.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the **References section** of the paper:

1. **Visual Genome Dataset**:
   > Krishna, R., Zhu, Y., Groth, O., Johnson, J., Hata, K., Kravitz, J., Chen, S., Kalantidis, Y., Li, L.-J., Shamma, D. A., et al. (2017). Visual Genome: Connecting Language and Vision Using Crowdsourced Dense Image Annotations. *International Journal of Computer Vision (IJCV)*, 123(1), 32-73.

2. **Bidirectional Relationship Dataset**: Since this dataset is derived from the Visual Genome dataset, it does not have a separate citation. Instead, I will note that it is a subset created for the specific purpose of this research.

After identifying the datasets and their citations, I will summarize the information in a structured manner, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its citation. This will facilitate easy reference and understanding of the datasets used in the research.

Finally, I will compile all the extracted information into a coherent format for further processing or review.
