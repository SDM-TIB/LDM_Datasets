To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Rigid Dynamics with Face Interaction Graph Networks" by Kelsey R. Allen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract highlights the introduction of the "Face Interaction Graph Network" (FIGNet) and mentions its application to real-world data, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly the **dataset details** subsection, which is likely to provide specific information about the datasets used in the experiments. In this paper, the authors mention two key datasets:

1. **Kubric Dataset**: This dataset consists of rigid-body simulations of diverse 3D objects tossed onto a large plane. It includes several subsets with varying complexity, specifically MOVi-A, MOVi-B, and MoviC. The authors detail the number of objects, types of shapes, and the material properties used in the simulations.

2. **MIT Pushing Dataset**: This dataset contains 6000 real-world pushes for 11 different objects along various surfaces. The authors describe the conditions under which the data was collected, including the velocities and angles of the pushes.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Kubric Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Klaus Greff, Francois Belletti, Lucas Beyer, et al. *Kubric: A scalable dataset generator*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pp. 3749–3761, June 2022.

- For the **MIT Pushing Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Kuan-Ting Yu, Maria Bauza, Nima Fazeli, and Alberto Rodriguez. *More than a million ways to be pushed: A high-fidelity experimental dataset of planar pushing*. In 2016 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS), pp. 30–37, 2016.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or analysis. This process ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their relevant details as presented in the research paper.
