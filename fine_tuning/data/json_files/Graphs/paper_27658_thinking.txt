To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Bermuda Triangles: GNNs Fail to Detect Simple Topological Structures" by Arseny Tolmachev et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors designed two synthetic tasks and that datasets and their generation scripts are publicly available on GitHub and a dataset lab site. This indicates that there are datasets involved, but I need to find their specific names and details.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section, where the authors discuss the importance of graph neural networks (GNNs) and mention the use of synthetic datasets to investigate graph topology learning. However, they do not provide specific dataset names here, so I will need to look further.

In the **synthetic tasks section (Section 2)**, the authors describe two specific datasets:

1. **Triangles Dataset**: This dataset consists of graphs that contain either exactly one triangle (3-clique) or exactly zero triangles. The authors explain how the dataset is generated by sampling random and k-nearest neighbor graphs and modifying them to ensure the presence or absence of triangles.

2. **Clique Distance Dataset**: This dataset is designed to check whether an approach can find high-order patterns in the data. It involves generating a base BA-graph and attaching cliques to it, with labels based on the distance between cliques.

In the **experiments section (Section 3)**, the authors confirm that they used these synthetic datasets to evaluate their proposed methods, which reinforces the importance of these datasets in their research.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. However, since these datasets are synthetic and generated by the authors, they may not have formal citations like publicly available datasets. Instead, I will note the URLs provided for accessing the datasets:

- For the **Triangles Dataset** and **Clique Distance Dataset**, the authors mention that the datasets and their generation scripts are publicly available at:
  > GitHub: https://github.com/FujitsuLaboratories/bermudatriangles
  > Dataset Lab: http://dataset.labs.fujitsu.com

Since these datasets are not from external sources but rather created by the authors, I will cite the paper itself as the source of the datasets.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with the necessary details, including the URLs for access, and ensure that I format the citations correctly for each dataset. 

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited.
