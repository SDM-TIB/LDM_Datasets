To extract datasets from the research paper titled "GroupContrast: Semantic-aware Self-supervised Representation Learning for 3D Understanding" by Chengyao Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments on multiple 3D scene understanding tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved. I will look for specific mentions of datasets in these sections.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention that they conducted experiments on **ScanNet** and **ScanNet200** for semantic segmentation, as well as **S3DIS** for additional evaluations. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for their research.

I will then check the **results comparison section** (Table 2) to confirm the datasets used for various tasks, including semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, and object detection. The results clearly indicate that the authors evaluated their method on the **ScanNet**, **ScanNet200**, and **S3DIS** datasets.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **ScanNet**, the citation is:
  > Angela Dai, Angel X Chang, Manolis Savva, Maciej Halber, Thomas Funkhouser, and Matthias Nießner. *ScanNet: Richly-annotated 3D reconstructions of indoor scenes*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 5828–5839, 2017.

- For **ScanNet200**, the citation is:
  > This dataset is derived from the original ScanNet dataset, and specific citation details may not be provided in the paper. However, it is commonly referenced as a subset of ScanNet.

- For **S3DIS**, the citation is:
  > Iro Armeni, Ozan Sener, Amir R. Zamir, Helen Jiang, Ioannis Brilakis, Martin Fischer, and Silvio Savarese. *3D semantic parsing of large-scale indoor spaces*. In CVPR, 2016.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the necessary details for each dataset used in the research.
