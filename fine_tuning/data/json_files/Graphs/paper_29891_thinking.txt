To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning High-Quality Proposals for Acne Detection" by Jianwei Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the construction of a new dataset called **AcneSCU** and references another public dataset, **ACNE04**. This indicates that there are at least two datasets to extract.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used in their experiments. Here, I will find specific information about:

1. **AcneSCU Dataset**: The authors describe it as containing 276 images with 31,777 annotations across 10 lesion categories. They emphasize its high-resolution images and precise annotations, which are crucial for acne detection research.

2. **ACNE04 Dataset**: This dataset is mentioned as a public dataset containing 1,457 images with 18,983 bounding box annotations for a single lesion category. The authors also mention how they split this dataset into training and testing sets.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **AcneSCU**, since it is a new dataset created by the authors, I will cite it as:
  > Jianwei Zhang, Lei Zhang, Junyou Wang, Xin Wei, Jiaqi Li, Xian Jiang, and Dandu. *Learning High-Quality Proposals for Acne Detection*. In Proceedings of the [Conference Name], [Year]. [Link if available].

- For **ACNE04**, I will look for the original paper that introduced this dataset. The citation is:
  > K. Rashataprucksa, C. Chuangchaichatchavarn, S. Triukose, S. Nitinawarat, M. Pongprutthipan, and K. Piromsopa. *Acne detection with deep neural networks*. In Proceedings of the 2020 2nd International Conference on Image Processing and Machine Vision, 2020, pp. 53â€“56.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this into a structured format for further processing or review.
