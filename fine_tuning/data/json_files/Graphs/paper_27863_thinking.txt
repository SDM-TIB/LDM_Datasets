To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Hybrid Generative-Contrastive Representation Learning" by Saehoon Kim et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (specifically section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this paper, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names and any relevant details about their characteristics.

Upon reviewing section 4.1 (Experiment Details), I find that the authors mention using three datasets: **CIFAR10**, **CIFAR100**, and **ImageNet32**. I will note down the details provided about these datasets, including the number of samples and any specific characteristics mentioned.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. This is crucial as it provides the necessary attribution for the datasets used in the research. 

1. For **CIFAR10**, the citation is:
   > Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. *CIFAR-10 (Canadian Institute for Advanced Research)*. 2009.

2. For **CIFAR100**, the citation is:
   > Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. *CIFAR-100 (Canadian Institute for Advanced Research)*. 2009.

3. For **ImageNet32**, the citation is:
   > J. Deng, W. Dong, R. Socher, L.-J. Li, K. Li, and L. Fei-Fei. *ImageNet: A Large-Scale Hierarchical Image Database*. In CVPR, 2009.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will help in accurately documenting the datasets used in the research paper.
