To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Pre-training Framework for Knowledge Graph Completion" by Kuo Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly discuss the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention two datasets:

1. **FB15k-237**: This dataset is described as a subset of FB15k, built by selecting facts incorporating the 401 largest relationships and removing all equivalent or inverse relations. The authors provide statistics indicating that it contains 14,541 entities, 237 relations, and a total of 272,115 training triples, along with 17,535 validation triples and 20,466 test triples.

2. **WN18RR**: This dataset is a subset of WN18, which contains 11 types of relations and fewer triples than WN18, as it filters out all triples with inverse relations. The statistics provided indicate that it contains 40,943 entities, 11 relations, with 86,835 training triples, 3,034 validation triples, and 3,134 test triples.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **FB15k-237**, the citation is:
  > Toutanova, K., Chen, D., Pantel, P., Poon, H., Choudhury, P., & Gamon, M. (2015). Representing text for joint embedding of text and knowledge bases. In Proceedings of the 2015 conference on empirical methods in natural language processing (pp. 1499â€“1509).

- For **WN18RR**, the citation is:
  > Dettmers, T., Minervini, P., Stenetorp, P., & Riedel, S. (2018). Convolutional 2d knowledge graph embeddings. In Proceedings of the AAAI conference on artificial intelligence (Vol. 32).

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
