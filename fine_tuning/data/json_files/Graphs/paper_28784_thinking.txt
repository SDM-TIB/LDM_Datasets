To extract datasets from the research paper titled "GAT-CADNet: Graph Attention Network for Panoptic Symbol Spotting in CAD Drawings" by Zhaohua Zheng et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted extensive experiments on a public benchmark, which suggests that a dataset is involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the need for large-scale datasets for symbol spotting in CAD drawings. They mention existing datasets like SESYD and FPLANPOLY but highlight their limitations. This prompts me to look for a dataset that the authors might have created or used.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their evaluations. They state that they used the **FloorPlanCAD dataset**, which is described as a large-scale dataset containing over 10,000 CAD drawings with segment-grained panoptic annotations. This is a significant dataset for their work.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the FloorPlanCAD dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:
> Zhiwen Fan, Lingjie Zhu, Honghua Li, Xiaohao Chen, Siyu Zhu, and Ping Tan. *FloorPlanCAD: A Large-Scale CAD Drawing Dataset for Panoptic Symbol Spotting*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2021.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the dataset as it is crucial for proper attribution.

In summary, the dataset extracted from the paper is:
1. **FloorPlanCAD Dataset**: A large-scale dataset with over 10,000 CAD drawings and segment-grained panoptic annotations.

The full citation for the dataset is:
> Zhiwen Fan, Lingjie Zhu, Honghua Li, Xiaohao Chen, Siyu Zhu, and Ping Tan. *FloorPlanCAD: A Large-Scale CAD Drawing Dataset for Panoptic Symbol Spotting*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2021.

With this information, I am ready to present the dataset details in the required format.
