To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Explainable Global Wildfire Prediction Models using Graph Neural Networks" by Dayou Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract discusses the use of a hybrid model for wildfire prediction and mentions benchmarking against JULES-INFERNO simulations, which suggests that this simulation data is a key dataset.

Next, I will examine **section 2 (Dataset)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the dataset used in their research. Here, they specifically mention the **Joint UK Land Environment Simulator (JULES)** and its associated **INFERNO** algorithm. They describe how JULES-INFERNO simulates various meteorological conditions and wildfire data, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's context.

In this section, the authors detail the parameters collected from the JULES-INFERNO simulations, including temperature, humidity, rainfall, and lightning, as well as the predicted burnt area fraction. They also mention that five ensemble members of JULES-INFERNO simulations were utilized, driven by specific meteorological conditions from the last glacial maximum scenario.

Now, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citation for the JULES-INFERNO dataset. The relevant citation is:

- For **JULES-INFERNO**:
  > Best, M. J., Pryor, M., Clark, D. B., Rooney, G. G., Essery, R. L. H., Ménard, C. B., Edwards, J. M., Hendry, M. A., Porson, A., Gedney, N., Mercado, L. M., Sitch, S., Blyth, E., Boucher, O., Cox, P. M., Grimmond, C. S. B., & Harding, R. J. (2011). The Joint UK Land Environment Simulator (JULES), model description – part 1: Energy and water fluxes. *Geosci. Model Dev.*, 4, 677–699.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset details into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the JULES-INFERNO dataset as it is the primary dataset referenced in the paper.

In summary, the key steps I will take are:
1. Review the abstract and introduction for initial mentions of datasets.
2. Examine section 2 for detailed descriptions of the datasets used.
3. Retrieve full citations from the references section.
4. Compile the dataset information with proper citations for clarity and completeness.
