To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Differentiable Programming Framework for Spin Models" by Tiago S. Farias et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, results, and conclusion sections** to find any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for simulations or experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to see if the authors discuss any datasets relevant to their work on spin models. This section often contains background information and may reference existing datasets used in similar studies.

I will then examine the **methods section**, where the authors describe their approach to simulating spin models. This section may include details about the datasets used for training or testing their models, especially if they are applying their framework to existing datasets.

In the **results section**, I will look for any mention of datasets used to validate the authors' findings. This section often includes comparisons with other methods and may specify the datasets used for benchmarking.

Finally, I will check the **conclusion** to see if the authors summarize their findings and mention any datasets that were particularly significant in their research.

After identifying any datasets, I will refer to the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

If the paper mentions specific datasets, I will document them as follows:

1. **Ising Model Dataset**: If the authors refer to a dataset used for the Ising model simulations, I will note its details and citation.
2. **Potts Model Dataset**: Similarly, if there is a dataset associated with the Potts model, I will extract that information.
3. **Cellular Potts Model Dataset**: If the paper discusses datasets used for the Cellular Potts model, I will include those as well.

Once I have gathered all relevant information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include full citations for each dataset as found in the references section. This will ensure that the datasets are properly credited and can be easily located by others interested in this research.

After completing this process, I will be ready to present the extracted datasets in the required format for further analysis or sharing.
