To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards a multimodal framework for remote sensing image change retrieval and captioning" by Roger Ferrod et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the use of the **LEVIR-CC dataset** for both captioning and text-image retrieval tasks. This indicates that a specific dataset is being utilized, which I need to explore further.

Next, I will look into **section 3.1 (Dataset)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the **LEVIR-CC dataset**. They state that it consists of **10,077 image pairs** with **5 captions each**, describing changes between the two images. The section also highlights that half of the pairs do not have significant changes, while the other half depicts various changes, such as new buildings or roads being constructed. This detailed description is crucial for understanding the dataset's structure and purpose.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the **LEVIR-CC dataset**. The authors refer to the original work that introduced this dataset, which is essential for proper citation. The citation is as follows:
> Liu, C., Zhao, R., Chen, H., Zou, Z., Shi, Z. (2022). *Remote sensing image change captioning with dual-branch transformers: A new method and a large scale dataset*. IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing, 60, 1â€“20.

Since the LEVIR-CC dataset is the only dataset mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and citation.

Finally, I will ensure that the dataset entry is clear and concise, ready for any further processing or review.
