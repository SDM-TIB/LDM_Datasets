To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Better Modeling the Programming World with Code Concept Graphs-augmented Multi-modal Learning" by Martin Weyssow et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, but I need to look for specific datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will examine **section 3 (Preliminary Evaluation)**, where the authors discuss their experimental setup. Here, they mention using a modified version of the **CodeSearchNet dataset**, which consists of 181,061 pairs of <code, doc> with specific splits for training, validation, and testing. This is a clear indication of a dataset being utilized.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the CodeSearchNet dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Husain, H., Wu, H.-H., Gazit, T., Allamanis, M., & Brockschmidt, M. (2019). Codesearchnet challenge: Evaluating the state of semantic code search. arXiv preprint arXiv:1909.09436.

Additionally, I will look for any other datasets mentioned throughout the paper. In this case, the authors do not explicitly mention any other datasets, so I will focus solely on the CodeSearchNet dataset.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry with the necessary details, including the dataset name, description, and full citation, ensuring that it is ready for downstream processing or review.
