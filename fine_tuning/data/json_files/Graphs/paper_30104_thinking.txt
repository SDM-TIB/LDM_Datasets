To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Personalized Federated Recommendation via Joint Representation Learning, User Clustering, and Model Adaptation" by Sichun Luo et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and while it discusses the application of the proposed method, it does not specify any datasets. Therefore, I will focus on the **experiments section** for detailed information.

In **section 4 (Experiments)**, the authors mention that they conducted experiments on three real-world datasets. I will look for the specific names and descriptions of these datasets in this section.

The paper lists the datasets in **section 4.1 (Experiment Setup)**, where it states:

1. **MovieLens-100K**: This dataset includes 100,000 user ratings from 943 users and 1,682 items, with a sparsity of 93.70%.
2. **Yelp**: This dataset consists of 5,224 users, 7,741 items, and 123,024 ratings, with a sparsity of 99.70%.
3. **Amazon-Kindle**: This dataset has 7,650 users, 9,173 items, and 137,124 ratings, with a sparsity of 99.80%.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **MovieLens-100K**, the citation is:
  > F. Maxwell Harper and Joseph A. Konstan. *The MovieLens Datasets: History and Context*. ACM Transactions on Interactive Intelligent Systems (TiiS), 5(4):19, 2015. DOI: 10.1145/2827872.

- For **Yelp**, the citation is:
  > Yelp Dataset Challenge. *Yelp Dataset Challenge*. Retrieved from https://www.yelp.com/dataset/challenge.

- For **Amazon-Kindle**, the citation is:
  > Julian McAuley and J. J. Leskovec. *Hidden Factors and Hidden Topics: Understanding Rating Dimensions with Review Text*. In Proceedings of the 7th ACM Conference on Recommender Systems (RecSys), pages 165â€“172, 2013. DOI: 10.1145/2507157.2507161.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. This includes ensuring that each dataset is clearly described with its respective citation for proper attribution.
