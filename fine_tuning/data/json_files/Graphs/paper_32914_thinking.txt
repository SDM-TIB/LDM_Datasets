To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CORE BUILDING BLOCKS: NEXT GEN GEO SPATIAL GPT APPLICATION" by Ashley Fernandez and Swaraj Dube, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and evaluation sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a high-level overview, but I will need to delve deeper into the sections that discuss the methodology and evaluations, as these are likely to contain specific references to datasets.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of existing models in handling spatial data, which may indicate the need for datasets that address these gaps. However, I will need to look for specific mentions of datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**. Here, the authors describe the design principles and the architecture of MapGPT. They mention the need for datasets that include both textual and spatial information for training the model. I will look for any specific datasets that are cited or described in this context.

In the **evaluation section**, the authors mention the use of "specialized datasets" for validating the model's performance. I will look for any specific names or citations of these datasets. If they provide examples or references to datasets used for geospatial tasks, I will note them down.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for the datasets used in the research.

If the paper does not provide specific dataset names, I will note that as well, indicating that while the authors discuss the need for datasets, they do not specify any particular ones.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation as found in the references.

This structured approach will help ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets referenced in the paper.
