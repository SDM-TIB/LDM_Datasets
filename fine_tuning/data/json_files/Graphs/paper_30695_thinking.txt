To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Iterative execution of discrete and inverse discrete Fourier transforms with applications for signal denoising via sparsification" by H. Robert Frost, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the application of the proposed algorithms for signal denoising, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine **section 4 (Detection of spike signals using iterative convergence)**, where the author describes the simulation design for testing the algorithm. Here, the author mentions generating input data as either a one-dimensional vector or a two-dimensional matrix containing a periodic spike signal with Gaussian noise. This indicates that the author has created synthetic datasets for their experiments.

In **section 4.1**, the author details the generation of the one-dimensional input vector \( x \) as a combination of a periodic spike signal \( s \) and Gaussian noise \( \epsilon \). The specifics of the generation process are provided, but no external datasets are referenced.

In **section 4.2**, the author describes the generation of a two-dimensional matrix \( X \) using a similar approach, indicating that this is also a synthetic dataset created for the purpose of the study.

Since the paper does not reference any publicly available datasets or external sources, I will note that the datasets used in the experiments are synthetic and generated as part of the simulation studies.

Now, I will check the **References section** to see if any datasets are cited. However, the references primarily consist of foundational texts and papers related to Fourier transforms and signal processing, rather than specific datasets.

Based on this analysis, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **Synthetic One-Dimensional Vector Dataset**: Generated as \( x = s + \epsilon \), where \( s \) is a periodic spike signal and \( \epsilon \) is Gaussian noise. The parameters for generating \( s \) and \( \epsilon \) are specified in the paper.

2. **Synthetic Two-Dimensional Matrix Dataset**: Generated as \( X = S + E \), where \( S \) is a matrix formed from the periodic spike signal and \( E \) is a noise matrix with independent Gaussian entries.

Since these datasets are not publicly available and are generated for the specific experiments in this paper, I will note that there are no formal citations for them.

Finally, I will compile the information about the datasets into a structured format for clarity, ensuring to highlight that they are synthetic datasets created for the study.
