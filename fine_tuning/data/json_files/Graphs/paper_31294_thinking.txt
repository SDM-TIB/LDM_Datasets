To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Mask3D: Pre-training 2D Vision Transformers by Learning Masked 3D Priors" by Ji Hou et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their method on various datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be referenced later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (specifically section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for training and evaluation. In this section, they mention three datasets: 

1. **ScanNet**: The authors state that they pre-train their model on ScanNet data, which contains 2.5 million RGB-D frames from 1513 video sequences. This dataset is crucial for their experiments.

2. **NYUv2**: The authors mention that they evaluate their method on the NYUv2 dataset, which consists of RGB-D video sequences of indoor scenes, comprising 1449 densely labeled RGB images.

3. **Cityscapes**: This dataset is referenced as another evaluation benchmark, specifically for outdoor scene understanding tasks.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **ScanNet**, the citation is:
  > Angela Dai, Angel X Chang, Manolis Savva, Maciej Halber, Thomas Funkhouser, and Matthias NieÃŸner. *ScanNet: Richly-annotated 3D reconstructions of indoor scenes*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2017.

- For **NYUv2**, the citation is:
  > Nathan Silberman, Derek Hoiem, Pushmeet Kohli, and Rob Fergus. *Indoor segmentation and support inference from RGB-D images*. In European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), 2012.

- For **Cityscapes**, the citation is:
  > Marius Cordts, Mohamed Omran, Sebastian Ramos, Timo Rehfeld, Markus Enzweiler, Rodrigo Benenson, Uwe Franke, Stefan Roth, and Bernt Schiele. *The cityscapes dataset for semantic urban scene understanding*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2016.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their full citations, I will summarize this information clearly, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described along with its citation for future reference or processing.
