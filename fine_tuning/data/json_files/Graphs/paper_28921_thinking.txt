To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SUPWMA: CONSISTENT AND EFFICIENT TRACTOGRAPHY PARCELLATION OF SUPERFICIAL WHITE MATTER WITH DEEP LEARNING" by Tengfei Xue et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their method on a large tractography dataset with ground truth labels and three independently acquired testing datasets. This suggests that there are multiple datasets to extract.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention the use of publicly available data from three datasets: the HCP dataset, the ABCD dataset, and the PPMI dataset. This is a clear indication that these datasets are relevant to the study.

Next, I will look into the **methodology section** where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used. They specify:

1. **HCP Dataset**: This dataset consists of 100 young healthy adults aged 22 to 35 years, with specific dMRI acquisition parameters.
2. **ABCD Dataset**: This dataset includes 25 teenagers aged 9 to 11 years, also with detailed dMRI acquisition parameters.
3. **PPMI Dataset**: This dataset comprises 25 elderly adults, including Parkinson's disease patients and healthy individuals, with their own set of dMRI acquisition parameters.

The authors also mention that a high-quality large-scale dataset with 1 million labeled streamlines was used for model training and validation, derived from an anatomically curated white matter tractography atlas.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **HCP dataset**, the citation is:
  > Van Essen DC, Smith SM, Barch DM, Behrens TEJ, Yacoub E, Ugurbil K, et al. *The WU-Minn Human Connectome Project: an overview*. Neuroimage. 2013;80: 62–79.

- For the **ABCD dataset**, the citation is:
  > Volkow ND, Koob GF, Croyle RT, Bianchi DW, et al. *The conception of the ABCD study: From substance use to a broad NIH collaboration*. Dev Cogn Neurosci. 2018;32: 4–7.

- For the **PPMI dataset**, the citation is:
  > Marek K, et al. *The Parkinson progression marker initiative (PPMI)*. Progress in neurobiology. 2011;95(4):629-35.

Additionally, the dataset derived from the anatomically curated white matter tractography atlas is referenced as:
  > Zhang F, Wu Y, Norton I, Rigolo L, Rathi Y, Makris N, et al. *An anatomically curated fiber clustering white matter atlas for consistent white matter tract parcellation across the lifespan*. Neuroimage. 2018;179: 429–447.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
