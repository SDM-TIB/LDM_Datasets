To extract datasets from the research paper titled "AVGCN: Trajectory Prediction using Graph Convolutional Networks Guided by Human Attention" by Congcong Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of an attention mechanism and mentions achieving state-of-the-art performance on several trajectory prediction benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will move to the **introduction** section. Here, I will look for any specific mentions of datasets used for evaluation. The introduction provides context about the challenges in trajectory prediction but does not explicitly name any datasets.

I will then check the **methods** section, particularly the subsections that detail the experimental setup. This is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for training and evaluation. In this paper, the authors mention using several datasets for their experiments, specifically:

1. **ETH Dataset**: A dataset containing pedestrian trajectories in a crowded environment, often used for evaluating trajectory prediction methods.
2. **HOTEL Dataset**: Another dataset featuring pedestrian trajectories in a hotel environment, useful for testing models in different settings.
3. **UNIV Dataset**: A dataset that includes trajectories from a university campus, providing a diverse set of pedestrian movements.
4. **ZARA1 Dataset**: A dataset capturing pedestrian trajectories in a shopping area, which is useful for understanding interactions in crowded spaces.
5. **ZARA2 Dataset**: A second dataset from the same environment as ZARA1 but with different conditions or scenarios.

In the **experiments** section, the authors confirm that they evaluated their model on these datasets, providing further validation of their use.

Next, I will consult the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- **ETH Dataset**:

- **HOTEL Dataset**:

- **UNIV Dataset**:

- **ZARA1 Dataset**:

- **ZARA2 Dataset**:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that all relevant details are captured accurately and can be referenced appropriately in future work.
