To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Adaptive Graph Contrastive Learning for Recommendation" by Yangqin Jiang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions "extensive experiments on three real-world datasets," which indicates that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Experimental Settings)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention three datasets:

1. **Last.FM**: This dataset contains social networking, tagging, and music artist listening information collected from users of the Last.fm online music system.

2. **Yelp**: This dataset includes user ratings on business venues collected from the Yelp platform, which is valuable for studying user preferences and behavior in personalized venue recommendations.

3. **BeerAdvocate**: This dataset consists of beer reviews from BeerAdvocate, processed using the 10-core setting to retain only users and items with at least 10 interactions.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. However, the paper does not provide specific citations for these datasets, as they are commonly used datasets in the field of recommendation systems. Therefore, I will note that these datasets are widely recognized and can be referenced as follows:

- **Last.FM**: 
  > Last.FM dataset is widely used in recommendation research and can be accessed at: https://www.last.fm/api.

- **Yelp**: 
  > Yelp dataset is publicly available for research purposes and can be found at: https://www.yelp.com/dataset.

- **BeerAdvocate**: 
  > BeerAdvocate dataset can be accessed through various repositories, commonly used in recommendation system studies.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the descriptions and the context in which they were used in the experiments. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
