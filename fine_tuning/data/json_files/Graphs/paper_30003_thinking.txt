To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "Modelling Social Context for Fake News Detection: A Graph Neural Network Based Approach" by Pallabi Saikia et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their method on two public datasets, **Politifact** and **GossipCop**, which suggests that these datasets are crucial for the research.

Next, I will focus on the **dataset description section** (Section III) where the authors provide detailed information about the datasets used. Here, they mention that they utilized the **FakeNewsNet** repository, which includes datasets from **Politifact** and **GossipCop**. The authors describe the datasets as follows:

1. **Politifact Dataset**: This dataset includes articles that are fact-checked based on U.S. politics, with a total of 432 fake articles and 624 real articles. The dataset provides ground truth labels assigned by independent journalists.

2. **GossipCop Dataset**: This dataset consists of celebrity news articles, with 5,323 fake articles and 16,817 real articles, also labeled by independent journalists.

The authors provide statistics for both datasets, including the number of articles, tweets, and unique users involved, which further confirms the datasets' relevance.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For the **FakeNewsNet** repository, the citation is:
  > Shu, K., Mahudeswaran, D., Wang, S., Lee, D., & Liu, H. (2018). FakeNewsNet: A data repository with news content, social context and spatial-temporal information for studying fake news on social media. arXiv preprint arXiv:1809.01286.

- For the **Politifact** dataset, the citation is:
  > Politifact. (n.d.). Retrieved from https://www.politifact.com/.

- For the **GossipCop** dataset, the citation is:
  > GossipCop. (n.d.). Retrieved from https://www.gossipcop.com/.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented and properly cited.
