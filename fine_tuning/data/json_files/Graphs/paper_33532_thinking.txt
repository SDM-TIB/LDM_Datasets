To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Self-Supervised Speech Representation and Contextual Text Embedding for Match-Mismatch Classification with EEG Recording" by Bo Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the use of EEG data, which suggests that there may be specific datasets referenced later in the paper.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the match-mismatch task in the ICASSP 2024 Auditory EEG Challenge, indicating that they are using EEG data for their experiments. However, I need to look for specific dataset names.

Next, I will focus on **section 2.2 (Dataset)**, where the authors state that they utilized preprocessed EEG data provided by the challenge organizers, referred to as "broadband EEG." They also mention a filtering process that resulted in "multi-band EEG." This section confirms that the datasets used are related to EEG recordings, but I need to find the full citation for the dataset.

The authors reference the dataset as broadband EEG and mention a citation [6] for it. I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for this dataset. The citation for the broadband EEG dataset is:

- For **broadband EEG**:
  > B. Accou, L. Bollens, M. Gillis, W. Verheijen, H. V. Hamme, and T. Francart. *SparrKULee: A speech-evoked auditory response repository of the KU Leuven, containing EEG of 85 participants*. bioRxiv, p. 2023.07.24.550310, 2023.

Additionally, the authors mention using the self-supervised speech model **wav2vec 2.0** and the pretrained language model **GPT-2** for feature extraction, but these are not datasets themselves. They are models used to process the data.

Now, I will compile the dataset entry for the broadband EEG dataset, ensuring to include the full citation as required.

After completing this process, I will have a clear and structured entry for the dataset used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
