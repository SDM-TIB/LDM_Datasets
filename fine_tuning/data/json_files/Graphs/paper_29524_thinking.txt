To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Meta Balanced Network for Fair Face Recognition" by Mei Wang, Yaobin Zhang, and Weihong Deng, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors contribute a benchmark called the **Identity Shades (IDS) database**, which quantifies bias in face recognition algorithms. This is a clear indication that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will examine **section 3 (Databases for Unbiased Training and Fairness Evaluation)**, where the authors describe the datasets in detail. Here, they mention three datasets:

1. **Identity Shades (IDS)**: This dataset is constructed to evaluate face recognition algorithms across different skin tones. It includes two versions: IDS-4 and IDS-8, with the former containing four skin tone bins and the latter containing eight.

2. **BUPT-Globalface Dataset**: This dataset consists of 2 million images from 38,000 celebrities, designed to represent the global distribution of skin tones.

3. **BUPT-Balancedface Dataset**: This dataset contains 1.3 million images from 28,000 celebrities and is balanced with respect to skin tone.

In the **experiments section**, the authors confirm that they used these datasets for their evaluations, which reinforces their importance in the study.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For the **Identity Shades (IDS)** dataset, the citation is:
  > Wang, M., Zhang, Y., & Deng, W. (2023). *Meta Balanced Network for Fair Face Recognition*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR).

- For the **BUPT-Globalface Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Wang, M., Zhang, Y., & Deng, W. (2023). *BUPT-Globalface: A Dataset for Fair Face Recognition*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR).

- For the **BUPT-Balancedface Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Wang, M., Zhang, Y., & Deng, W. (2023). *BUPT-Balancedface: A Balanced Dataset for Face Recognition*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR).

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described accurately and includes the full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details or citations.
