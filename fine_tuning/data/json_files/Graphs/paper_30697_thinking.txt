To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Numerical Optimizations for Weighted Low-rank Estimation on Language Model" by Ting Hua et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned or referenced. The abstract discusses the evaluation of the proposed method on various language tasks, which may indicate the presence of specific datasets.

Next, I will look into **section 4.1 (Language tasks and datasets)**, as this section is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets used for evaluation. Here, I will carefully read through the descriptions of the tasks and datasets to identify any specific datasets mentioned.

In section 4.1, the authors mention several datasets used for evaluation, including:

1. **CoLA (Corpus of Linguistic Acceptability)**: This dataset is used for a single sentence task and is measured in Matthew's correlation. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Warstadt, A., Singh, A., & Bowman, S. R. (2018). Neural network acceptability judgments.

2. **SST-2 (Stanford Sentiment Treebank)**: This dataset is used for sentiment classification and is measured in classification accuracy. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Socher, R., Perelygin, A., Wu, J., Chuang, J., Manning, C. D., Ng, A. Y., & Potts, C. (2013). Recursive deep models for semantic compositionality over a sentiment treebank.

3. **MRPC (Microsoft Research Paraphrase Corpus)**: This dataset is used for sentence similarity tasks and is measured in F-1 score. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Dolan, B., Brockett, C., & Quirk, C. (2005). Microsoft research paraphrase corpus.

4. **STS-B (Semantic Textual Similarity Benchmark)**: This dataset is used for measuring semantic similarity and is evaluated using Pearson-Spearman correlation. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Cer, D., Diab, M., Agirre, E., Lopez-Gazpio, I., & Specia, L. (2017). SemEval-2017 task 1: Semantic textual similarity multilingual and crosslingual focused evaluation.

5. **QQP (Quora Question Pairs)**: This dataset is also used for sentence similarity tasks and is measured in F-1 score. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Chen, Z., Zhang, H., Zhang, X., & Zhao, L. (2018). Quora question pairs.

6. **MNLI (Multi-Genre Natural Language Inference)**: This dataset is used for natural language inference tasks and is measured in classification accuracy. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Williams, A., Nangia, N., & Bowman, S. R. (2018). A broad-coverage challenge corpus for sentence understanding through inference.

7. **QNLI (Question Natural Language Inference)**: This dataset is also used for natural language inference tasks and is measured in accuracy. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Rajpurkar, P., Zhang, J., Lopyrev, K., & Liang, P. (2016). SQuAD: 100,000+ questions for machine comprehension of text.

8. **CoNLL-2003**: This dataset is used for named entity recognition tasks. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Sang, E. T. K., & De Meulder, F. (2003). Introduction to the CoNLL-2003 shared task: Language-independent named entity recognition.

After identifying these datasets, I will ensure to compile the full citations for each dataset as they are crucial for proper referencing.

Finally, I will summarize the findings in a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly documented along with its citation for future reference or use.
