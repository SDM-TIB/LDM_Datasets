To extract datasets from the research paper titled "FECTEK: ENHANCING TERM WEIGHT IN LEXICON-BASED RETRIEVAL WITH FEATURE CONTEXT AND TERM-LEVEL KNOWLEDGE," I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the proposed method is evaluated on the **MS Marco benchmark**, which indicates that this dataset is likely used in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Implementation Details)**, where the authors explicitly state that their method is trained and evaluated on the **MS MARCO passage ranking dataset**. This section provides details about the dataset, including the number of passages and queries, which is crucial for understanding its scope.

The authors describe the **MS MARCO dataset** as follows:
- It contains **8.8 million passages** and **0.5 million pairs of queries and relevant passages**. This information is essential for documenting the dataset's size and purpose.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the MS MARCO dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:
> Nguyen, T., Rosenberg, M., Song, X., Gao, J., Tiwary, S., Majumder, R., & Deng, L. (2016). *MS MARCO: A human generated machine reading comprehension dataset*. In Proceedings of the 2016 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), pages 2640â€“2650.

With this information, I have successfully identified the dataset used in the research paper and its citation.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and full citation, ensuring that all relevant details are captured for future reference or processing.
