To extract datasets from the research paper titled "FedSSC: Shared Supervised-Contrastive Federated Learning" by Sirui Hu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often discusses the datasets used for experiments.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention the challenges of federated learning in non-IID settings, but they do not specify any datasets yet. I will need to look further into the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section V (Dataset)**, where the authors explicitly state that they used the **CIFAR-10 dataset** for their experiments. They describe how they simulated a non-IID scenario using the Dirichlet distribution to allocate samples to devices, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's application in their research.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the CIFAR-10 dataset. The CIFAR-10 dataset is a well-known dataset in the machine learning community, and its citation is typically available in the literature. The standard citation for CIFAR-10 is:

- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical Report, 2009. [Online]. Available: https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry for CIFAR-10, ensuring that I include the full citation as required.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry in the specified format, ready for any further processing or review.
