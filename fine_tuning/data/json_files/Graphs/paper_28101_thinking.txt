To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Contrastive Learning for View Classification of Echocardiograms" by Agisilaos Chartsias et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract discusses the use of contrastive learning on echocardiogram datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed involved.

Next, I will examine the **methodology section**, particularly the **data subsection**, where the authors describe the dataset used in their study. Here, they mention that the dataset comprises anonymized 2D echocardiograms from multiple sites, including data from the **EVAREST trial**, the **EchoNet public dataset**, and proprietary data from other imaging sites. This is a crucial step as it provides the names of the datasets.

In the **data subsection**, the authors provide a detailed breakdown of the dataset, including the number of subjects, echocardiograms, and images for both the training and test sets. They specify that the dataset is split into a training set of 1,538 echocardiograms and a test set of 359 echocardiograms, with a total of 327,019 image frames in the training set and 57,648 in the test set.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The citations I need to retrieve are:

1. **EVAREST trial**: The authors reference this trial in the context of their dataset. I will look for the citation in the references.
   - The citation is:
     > Woodward, W., Dockerill, C., McCourt, A., Upton, R., O’Driscoll, J., Balkhausen, K., Chandrasekaran, B., Firoozan, S., Kardos, A., Wong, K., Woodward, G., Sarwar, R., Sabharwal, N., Benedetto, E., Spagou, N., Sharma, R., Augustine, D., Tsiachristas, A., Senior, R., Leeson, P., Boardman, H., D’Arcy, J., Abraheem, A., Banypersad, S., Boos, C., Bulugahapitiya, S., Butts, J., Coles, D., Easaw, J., Hamdan, H., Jamil-Copley, S., Kanaganayagam, G., Mwambingu, T., Pantazis, A., Papachristidis, A., Rajani, R., Rasheed, M.A., Razvi, N.A., Rekhraj, S., Ripley, D.P., Rose, K., Scheuermann-Freestone, M., et al. *Real-world performance and accuracy of stress echocardiography: the EVAREST observational multi-centre study*. European Heart Journal - Cardiovascular Imaging 44(March), 1–10 (2021).

2. **EchoNet public dataset**: The authors also reference this dataset, and I will find its citation.
   - The citation is:
     > Ouyang, D., He, B., Ghorbani, A., Yuan, N., Ebinger, J., Langlotz, C.P., Heidenreich, P.A., Harrington, R.A., Liang, D.H., Ashley, E.A., Zou, J.Y. *Video-based AI for beat-to-beat assessment of cardiac function*. Nature 580(7802), 252–256 (2020).

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as specified. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
