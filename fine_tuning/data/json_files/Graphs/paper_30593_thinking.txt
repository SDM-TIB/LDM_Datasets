To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Scalable Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning through Intelligent Information Aggregation" by Siddharth Nayak et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, but it may not contain detailed dataset information. The introduction often outlines the context and may reference datasets used in prior work, which could be relevant.

Next, I will pay close attention to **section 4 (Experiments)**, as this section typically contains detailed descriptions of the datasets used for evaluation. In this paper, the authors mention evaluating their model on four different navigation tasks: Target, Coverage, Formation, and Line. I will look for any specific datasets or environments that are referenced in relation to these tasks.

Upon reviewing the experiments, I find that the authors describe the environments in detail, but they do not explicitly cite any external datasets. Instead, they mention that the environments are modifications of the Multi-Agent Particle Environment (MAPE). Therefore, I will need to reference the original MAPE dataset as it serves as the foundation for the environments used in this research.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the MAPE dataset. The relevant citation is:

- For the Multi-Agent Particle Environment (MAPE):
  > Lowe, R., Wu, Y., Tamar, A., Harb, J., Abbeel, P., and Mordatch, I. *Multi-agent actor-critic for mixed cooperative-competitive environments*. CoRR, abs/1706.02275, 2017. URL http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.02275.

Since the paper does not introduce any new datasets but rather utilizes existing environments, I will document the MAPE dataset as the primary dataset referenced in the research.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry with the full citation into a structured format for clarity and future reference.
