To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "FewUser: Few-Shot Social User Geolocation via Contrastive Learning" by Menglin Li and Kwan Hui Lim, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors constructed two datasets, **TwiU** and **FliU**, which are essential for evaluating their proposed framework. This is a strong indication that these datasets will be detailed further in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiment Results)**, where the authors discuss the datasets in detail. Here, they describe:

1. **TwiU Dataset**: This dataset builds upon the WNUT16 dataset and includes 7,789 users from 1,261 cities worldwide. It contains rich metadata such as user names, descriptions, creation date-times, locations, languages, tweet texts, and more.

2. **FliU Dataset**: Derived from the YFCC-100M dataset, this dataset consists of 11,395 users from 1,688 distinct US cities. It includes user-related fields and post-related columns, providing a comprehensive view of user profiles and their geolocation.

The authors also mention that these datasets contain richer metadata than existing benchmarks, which is crucial for their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The citations are as follows:

- For **TwiU Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Han, B., Rahimi, A., Derczynski, L., Baldwin, T. (2016). *Twitter geolocation prediction shared task of the 2016 workshop on noisy user-generated text*. In Proceedings of WNUT’16, pp. 213–217.

- For **YFCC-100M Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Thomee, B., Shamma, D.A., Friedland, G., Elizalde, B., Ni, K., Poland, D., Borth, D., Li, L.J. (2016). *YFCC100M: The new data in multimedia research*. Communications of the ACM, 59(2), 64–73.

With this information, I can now summarize the datasets and their citations effectively.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
