To extract datasets from the research paper titled "EDGE2NODE: REDUCING EDGE PREDICTION TO NODE CLASSIFICATION" by Zahed Rahmati, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, but I will need to delve deeper into the introduction and methodology to find specific datasets.

In the **introduction**, the author discusses edge prediction and node classification but does not mention any specific datasets. I will then check the **methodology section** for any references to datasets used for experiments or evaluations.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. If the paper does not have a specific section for datasets, I will check the **references** for any datasets that might be cited indirectly.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that it references the **Open Graph Benchmark** (OGB) in the context of datasets for machine learning on graphs. This is a significant dataset that is relevant to the research topic.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to retrieve the full citation for the Open Graph Benchmark:

- For the **Open Graph Benchmark**, the citation is:
  > Weihua Hu, Matthias Fey, Marinka Zitnik, Yuxiao Dong, Hongyu Ren, Bowen Liu, Michele Catasta, and Jure Leskovec. *Open graph benchmark: Datasets for machine learning on graphs*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2005.00687, 2020.

Since the paper primarily discusses methodologies and does not introduce new datasets, the Open Graph Benchmark is the key dataset mentioned.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and full citation, ensuring that all necessary details are accurately represented for future reference or processing.
