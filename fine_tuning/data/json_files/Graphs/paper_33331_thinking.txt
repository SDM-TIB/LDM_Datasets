To extract datasets from the research paper titled "NearbyPatchCL: Leveraging Nearby Patches for Self-Supervised Patch-Level Multi-Class Classification in Whole-Slide Images" by Gia-Bao Le et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors curated a new dataset derived from whole-slide images (WSIs) sourced from the Canine Cutaneous Cancer Histology, which suggests that a dataset is indeed present.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Proposed P-CATCH Dataset)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset they created. They mention the original CATCH dataset and how they derived their new dataset, P-CATCH, from it. 

In **subsection 4.1**, the authors describe the original CATCH dataset, which consists of 350 WSIs with various annotations. They also mention the imbalance in the distribution of tissue classes, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's context.

In **subsection 4.2**, they detail the proposed P-CATCH dataset, which includes both unlabeled and annotated sets. They specify that 70% of the original CATCH dataset is used for training self-supervised learning methods, and they provide statistics on the number of patches extracted from these WSIs.

The authors also mention the creation of different subsets of the P-CATCH dataset, denoted as P-CATCH-N, where N indicates the number of nearby samples. This is important for understanding the variations within the dataset.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. For the **CATCH dataset**, the citation is:
   > Wilm, F., Fragoso, M., Marzahl, C., Bertram, C., Klopfleisch, R., Maier, A., Aubreville, M., Breininger, K., Klopfleisch, R., & Maier, A. (2022). *Canine cutaneous cancer histology dataset*. Retrieved from https://wiki.cancerimagingarchive.net/x/DYITBg

2. For the **P-CATCH dataset**, since it is a new dataset introduced in this paper, I will cite it as follows:
   > Le, G.-B., Nguyen, V.-T., Le, T.-N., & Tran, M.-T. (2023). *P-CATCH: A new benchmark dataset for patch-level multi-class classification in whole-slide images*. In Proceedings of the [Conference Name], [pages], [year].

Now, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing. This includes ensuring that I have captured the essential details about each dataset, including their names, descriptions, and full citations.
