To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "Quantifying Urban Canopy Cover with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks" by Bill Cai et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors trained deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) on datasets used for self-driving cars, which suggests that specific datasets will be discussed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Dataset and Methods)**, as this section is likely to contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used. Here, the authors mention that they selected images from **Google Street View (GSV)** for their training and testing. They specifically state that they randomly selected 100 images from each of five cities: Cambridge (USA), Johannesburg (South Africa), Oslo (Norway), São Paulo (Brazil), and Singapore (Singapore). This gives me the first dataset:

1. **Google Street View Dataset**: A dataset consisting of 500 images (100 from each of the five cities) used for training, validation, and testing, with manual labels for vertical vegetation.

The authors also mention that they used the **Cityscapes dataset** to augment their model training. This dataset is designed for autonomous driving and contains over 5000 images taken from vehicle-mounted cameras in various German cities. This is the second dataset:

2. **Cityscapes Dataset**: A dataset containing over 5000 images with fine annotations for semantic segmentation, which the authors adapted for their study by collapsing multi-class labels into binary labels for vegetation and non-vegetation.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Cityscapes dataset**, the citation is:
  > Marius Cordts, Mohamed Omran, Sebastian Ramos, Timo Rehfeld, Markus Enzweiler, Rodrigo Benenson, Uwe Franke, Stefan Roth, and Bernt Schiele. *The Cityscapes Dataset for Semantic Urban Scene Understanding*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 3213–3223, 2016.

The **Google Street View dataset** does not have a formal citation in the references, but it is commonly referenced in the context of urban studies and can be cited as follows:
  > Google LLC. *Google Street View*. Available at: https://www.google.com/streetview/

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
