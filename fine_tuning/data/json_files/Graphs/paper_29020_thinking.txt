To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fingerprinting Deep Neural Networks Globally via Universal Adversarial Perturbations" by Zirui Peng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions evaluating the proposed method on three popular image classification datasets: **FashionMNIST, CIFAR-10, and TinyImageNet**. This indicates that these datasets are likely used in the experiments.

Next, I will check the **experiments section** (section 5) for more detailed descriptions of these datasets. In this section, the authors explicitly state that they evaluate their approach on **FashionMNIST**, **CIFAR-10**, and **TinyImageNet**. They provide some context about the datasets, such as their purpose in benchmarking machine learning algorithms.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. 

1. **FashionMNIST**: The citation is:
   > Han Xiao, Kashif Rasul, and Roland Vollgraf. *Fashion-MNIST: a novel image dataset for benchmarking machine learning algorithms*. 2017.

2. **CIFAR-10**: The citation is:
   > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton, et al. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. 2009.

3. **TinyImageNet**: The citation is:
   > Tiny-ImageNet dataset. https://www.kaggle.com/c/tiny-imagenet.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, which is essential for reproducibility and further research in the field.
