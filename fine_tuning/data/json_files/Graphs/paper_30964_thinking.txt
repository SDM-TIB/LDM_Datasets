To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A contrastive learning approach for individual re-identification in a wild fish population" by Ørjan Langøy Olsen et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study involves a dataset of images collected from captures and recaptures of corkwing wrasse (Symphodus melops), which suggests that there is a specific dataset to extract.

Next, I will focus on the **data collection section** (3.1), where the authors describe the dataset in detail. They mention that the dataset consists of **2113 images from 513 unique individuals** of corkwing wrasse, collected between 2018 and 2021 in Austevoll, Norway. This section provides essential details about the dataset, including the number of images and individuals, which are crucial for the dataset description.

I will also check the **experiments section** to confirm that this dataset was used for the experiments, which it is, as the authors refer to it when discussing their re-identification system.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. However, since the dataset is primarily based on the authors' own collection of images, there may not be a formal citation like those for established datasets. Instead, I will note that the dataset is original and created by the authors.

The relevant details for the dataset are as follows:

1. **Dataset Name**: Corkwing Wrasse Image Dataset
   - **Description**: A dataset consisting of 2113 images of corkwing wrasse (Symphodus melops) captured during field studies in Austevoll, Norway, from 2018 to 2021. The dataset includes images of both sides of the fish and is used for individual re-identification tasks.
   - **Citation**: Original dataset created by Ørjan Langøy Olsen et al. (2023).

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry into the required format, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and citation clearly. This will ensure that the dataset is properly documented for future reference or use in related research.
