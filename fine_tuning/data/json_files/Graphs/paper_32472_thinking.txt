To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Decentralized Graph Neural Network for Privacy-Preserving Recommendation" by Zhongyu Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract states that the authors conducted extensive experiments on three public datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed involved.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In the provided text, the authors mention three datasets: **Flixster**, **Book-crossing**, and **Weeplaces**. I will take note of the details provided about these datasets, including their characteristics such as the number of users, items, interactions, and sparsity.

I will then check the **experiments section** where the authors describe the datasets used for validation. They provide a table (Table 1) that summarizes the statistics of the datasets, which includes:

1. **Flixster**: 
   - Number of Users: 3,060
   - Number of Items: 3,000
   - Number of Interactions: 48,369
   - Sparsity: 0.9946

2. **Book-crossing**: 
   - Number of Users: 8,720
   - Number of Items: 7,407
   - Number of Interactions: 546,781
   - Sparsity: 0.9915

3. **Weeplaces**: 
   - Number of Users: 3,060
   - Number of Items: 5,240
   - Number of Interactions: 222,287
   - Sparsity: 0.9860

Next, I will look at the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. However, the paper does not provide specific citations for the datasets themselves, as they are likely well-known public datasets. Therefore, I will provide general references for these datasets based on common knowledge:

- **Flixster Dataset**: 
  > Ziegler, C.-N., McNee, S. M., Konstan, J. A., & Lausen, G. (2005). Improving recommendation lists through topic diversification. In Proceedings of the 14th International Conference on World Wide Web (WWW), 22-32. https://doi.org/10.1145/1060745.1060754

- **Book-crossing Dataset**:

- **Weeplaces Dataset**:

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and citations. This will ensure that I have accurately documented the datasets used in the research paper.
