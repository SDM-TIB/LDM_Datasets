To extract datasets from the research paper titled "NetSMF: Large-Scale Network Embedding as Sparse Matrix Factorization" by Jiezhong Qiu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the datasets used.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets employed in their experiments. This section typically contains detailed statistics about each dataset, such as the number of vertices, edges, and labels, which are crucial for understanding the datasets' characteristics.

In this paper, the authors mention five datasets:

1. **BlogCatalog**: A social network of online bloggers with 10,312 vertices, 333,983 edges, and 39 labels.
2. **PPI (Protein-Protein Interactions)**: A subgraph of the PPI network for Homo Sapiens, containing 3,890 vertices, 76,584 edges, and 50 labels.
3. **Flickr**: A user contact network from Flickr, consisting of 80,513 vertices, 5,899,882 edges, and 195 labels.
4. **YouTube**: A network of users on a video-sharing platform, with 1,138,499 vertices, 2,990,443 edges, and 47 labels.
5. **Open Academic Graph (OAG)**: An academic co-authorship network with 67,768,244 authors, 895,368,962 collaboration edges, and 19 distinct fields of study as labels.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are essential for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- **BlogCatalog**: 
  > Nitin Agarwal, Huan Liu, Sudheendra Murthy, Arunabha Sen, and Xufei Wang. 2009. A Social Identity Approach to Identify Familiar Strangers in a Social Network. In ICWSM ’09.

- **PPI**: 
  > Chris Stark et al. 2010. The BioGRID interaction database: 2011 update. Nucleic acids research 39, suppl_1 (2010), D698–D704.

- **Flickr**: 
  > Lei Tang and Huan Liu. 2009. Relational learning via latent social dimensions. In KDD ’09.

- **YouTube**:

- **Open Academic Graph (OAG)**: 
  > Arnab Sinha et al. 2015. An overview of microsoft academic service (mas) and applications. In WWW ’15.

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, I will compile this into a structured format for further use or analysis. This includes the dataset names, their characteristics, and their full citations, ensuring that all relevant details are captured accurately.
