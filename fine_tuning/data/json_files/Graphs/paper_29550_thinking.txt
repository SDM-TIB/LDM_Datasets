To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Simple Yet Effective SVD-GCN for Directed Graphs" by Chunya Zou et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted empirical experiments on node classification datasets, which indicates that datasets are involved. I will look for specific names or descriptions of these datasets.

Next, I will examine **section 4.1 (Datasets and Baselines)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention several datasets, including:

1. **cora_ml**: A citation network dataset with 2,995 nodes, 8,416 edges, 7 classes, and 2,879 features.
2. **citeseer**: Another citation network dataset with 3,312 nodes, 4,715 edges, 6 classes, and 3,703 features.
3. **citeseer_full**: A full version of the Citeseer dataset with 3,327 nodes, 3,703 edges, 6 classes, and 602 features.
4. **amazon_photo**: A co-purchase network dataset with 7,650 nodes, 143,663 edges, 8 classes, and 745 features.
5. **amazon_cs**: Another co-purchase network dataset with 13,752 nodes, 287,209 edges, 10 classes, and 767 features.
6. **cora_full**: An extended version of the Cora dataset with 19,793 nodes, 65,311 edges, 70 classes, and 8,710 features.

In the **experiments section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for their evaluations, providing further validation of their relevance.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:

- For **cora_ml**, the citation is:
  > Bojchevski, A., & Günnemann, S. (2017). Deep Gaussian embedding of graphs: Unsupervised inductive learning via ranking. arXiv preprint arXiv:1707.03815.

- For **citeseer**, the citation is:
  > Yang, Z., Cohen, W., & Salakhudinov, R. (2016). Revisiting semi-supervised learning with graph embeddings. In Proceedings of the 33rd International Conference on Machine Learning (Vol. 48, pp. 40-48).

- For **citeseer_full**, the citation is:
  > Yang, Z., Cohen, W., & Salakhudinov, R. (2016). Revisiting semi-supervised learning with graph embeddings. In Proceedings of the 33rd International Conference on Machine Learning (Vol. 48, pp. 40-48).

- For **amazon_photo** and **amazon_cs**, the citation is:
  > Shchur, O., Mumme, M., Bojchevski, A., & Günnemann, S. (2018). Pitfalls of graph neural network evaluation. arXiv preprint arXiv:1811.05868.

- For **cora_full**, the citation is:
  > Bojchevski, A., & Günnemann, S. (2018). Deep Gaussian embedding of graphs: Unsupervised inductive learning via ranking. In International Conference on Learning Representations.

With this information, I can now compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details in the extraction process.
