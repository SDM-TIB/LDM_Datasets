To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Contrastive Learning for Regression on Hyperspectral Data" by Mohamad Dhaini et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that experiments were conducted on both synthetic and real hyperspectral datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments & Results)**, as this section typically contains detailed descriptions of the datasets used. In **subsection 4.1 (Synthetic Data)**, the authors mention that they generated synthetic data using four random endmembers selected from the **USGS digital spectral library**. This indicates that the USGS library is a dataset used in their experiments.

In **subsection 4.2 (Real Soil Data)**, the authors describe a dataset provided by **Tellux** for soil pollution analysis, which consists of 10,000 spectra with a specific spectral range and pollution concentration. This dataset is crucial for understanding the real-world application of their method.

Now, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. For the **USGS digital spectral library**, the citation is:
   > GA Swayze, RN Clark, TVV King, A Gallagher, and WM Calvin. "The US Geological Survey, Digital Spectral Library: Version 1: 0.2 to 3.0 mum." In Bulletin of the American Astronomical Society, 1993, vol. 25, p. 1033.

2. For the **Tellux soil pollution dataset**, the citation is:
   > Mohamad Dhaini, François-Joseph Roudaut, Antonin Garrett, Ronan Arzur, Audrey Chereau, Fanny Buhler-Varenne, Paul Honeine, Mélanie Mignot, and Antonin van Exem.

In RemTech (International event on Remediation, Coasts, Floods, Climate, Seismic, Regeneration Industry), 2021.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets in a structured manner, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
