To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Physics-Guided Graph Neural Networks for Real-time AC/DC Power Flow Analysis" by Mei Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and case study sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for experiments. The introduction often discusses the context and significance of the research, which might include references to datasets.

Next, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets in the **methodology section**. This section typically outlines the experimental setup and may detail the datasets used for training and testing the proposed models. I will pay close attention to any tables or figures that might summarize the datasets.

In the **case study section**, the authors describe the experimental settings and may provide specific details about the datasets used, including their size, source, and any relevant characteristics. For example, the paper mentions using historical data on renewable generation and load profiles, which is crucial for understanding the datasets involved.

I will also check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. This is essential for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

From my reading, I identify the following datasets:

1. **Historical Data on Renewable Generation and Load**: The paper states that 50,000 groups of data on renewable generation and load were gathered, with 75% serving as training data and the remaining as testing data. However, the paper does not provide a specific citation for this dataset, which may be a limitation.

2. **IEEE 30-Bus System**: The modified IEEE 30-bus system is mentioned as a benchmark for the case study. The citation for this dataset is:
   > J. Beerten, S. Cole, and R. Belmans. "Generalized steady-state VSC MTDC model for sequential AC/DC power flow algorithms." *IEEE Transactions on Power Systems*, vol. 27, no. 2, pp. 821â€“829, 2012.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
