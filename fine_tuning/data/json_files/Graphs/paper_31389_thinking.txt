To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Improving the Robustness of Deep Convolutional Neural Networks Through Feature Learning" by Jin Ding et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on multiple datasets, which indicates that there are datasets to be extracted.

Next, I will focus on **section IV (Experiments)**, where the authors provide details about the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they specifically mention three datasets:

1. **CIFAR-10**: This dataset includes 10 classes, with 6,000 training images and 1,000 test images per class. The authors note that the resolution of the images is 32×32 pixels.

2. **TinyImageNet**: This dataset consists of 200 classes, each containing 500 training images and 50 validation images. The resolution of the images is 64×64 pixels.

3. **Cats-and-Dogs**: This dataset includes 2 classes, each with 12,500 images. The authors specify that they used 9,000 images for training, 1,000 for validation, and 2,500 for testing, with images resized to 224×224 pixels.

I will then verify the details of these datasets in the **experiments section** to ensure that they are indeed the datasets used for the experiments and to gather any additional relevant information.

After confirming the datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations of these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and will be included in the dataset descriptions.

The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton et al. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. 2009.

- For **TinyImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Y. Le and X. Yang. *Tiny ImageNet Visual Recognition Challenge*. CS 231N, vol. 7, no. 7, p. 3, 2015.

- For **Cats-and-Dogs**, the citation is:
  > J. Elson, J. J. Douceur, J. Howell, and J. Saul. *Asirra: A captcha that exploits interest-aligned manual image categorization*. In Proceedings of 14th ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security (CCS), October 2007.

Now, I will compile the extracted dataset information along with their full citations into a structured format for further processing or review.
