To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Generating 3D Molecules for Target Protein Binding" by Meng Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the use of "large-scale datasets of protein-ligand complex structures," which indicates that datasets are indeed involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors specifically mention two datasets: **PDBbind** (Liu et al., 2017) and **CrossDocked2020** (Francoeur et al., 2020). This is a crucial step as it provides the names of the datasets that are relevant to their research.

In the **experiments section**, the authors describe their evaluation process and confirm that they used the **CrossDocked2020 dataset** for their experiments. They also provide details about how they filtered the dataset to obtain around 500k protein-ligand complexes, which further validates the dataset's relevance.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. For **PDBbind**, the citation is:
   > Liu, Z., Su, M., Han, L., Liu, J., Yang, Q., Li, Y., and Wang, R. *Forging the basis for developing protein–ligand interaction scoring functions*. Accounts of chemical research, 50(2):302–309, 2017.

2. For **CrossDocked2020**, the citation is:
   > Francoeur, P. G., Masuda, T., Sunseri, J., Jia, A., Iovanisci, R. B., Snyder, I., and Koes, D. R. *Three-dimensional convolutional neural networks and a cross-docked data set for structure-based drug design*. Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling, 60(9):4200–4215, 2020.

With these citations in hand, I will now summarize the datasets:

- **CrossDocked2020**: A dataset containing over 22 million docked protein-ligand crystal structures, filtered to yield around 500k protein-ligand complexes for evaluation.

- **PDBbind**: A dataset that serves as a benchmark for evaluating protein-ligand binding affinity.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries with their full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented and properly cited for future reference.
