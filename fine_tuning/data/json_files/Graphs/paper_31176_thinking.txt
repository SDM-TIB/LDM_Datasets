To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "Multispectral Contrastive Learning with Viewmaker Networks" by Jasmine Bayrooti et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information and provide full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors apply contrastive learning to various remote sensing datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be discussed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **Methods** section, particularly **section 3.3 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly introduce the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention four datasets:

1. **EuroSAT**: This dataset consists of 27,000 low cloud-cover satellite images from Sentinel-2, labeled with one of 10 classes describing land use. Each image includes 13 spectral bands. 

2. **So2Sat LCZ42**: A benchmark dataset composed of 400,673 low cloud-cover images collected by Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 satellites, labeled with one of 17 classes in the Local Climate Zones classification scheme.

3. **BigEarthNet**: A multi-label dataset made up of 590,326 Sentinel-2 image patches, labeled with a subset of 43 land-cover classes.

4. **NWPU-RESISC45**: A dataset of 31,500 RGB satellite images sourced from Google Earth, labeled with one of 45 classes.

I will then verify the details of each dataset in the **Experiments** section to confirm their usage in the study. The authors mention applying Viewmaker and Divmaker to these datasets, which reinforces their relevance.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:

- For **EuroSAT**, the citation is:

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
