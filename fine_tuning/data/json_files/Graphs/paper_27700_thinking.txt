To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Temporal graph-based approach for behavioural entity classification" by Francesco Zola et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract and introduction** sections to get an overview of the research focus and any datasets that may be mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors utilize a dataset for their analysis, specifically mentioning the **UNSW-NB15 dataset**.

Next, I will look into the **Methodology section**, particularly the **Validation** subsection, where the authors describe their experiments. Here, they explicitly state that they use the **UNSW-NB15 dataset** for the Manipulation phase. I will gather details about this dataset, including its characteristics and purpose as described in the paper.

In the **Validation section**, the authors provide a brief description of the UNSW-NB15 dataset, noting that it contains real normal and synthetic abnormal network traffic generated in a controlled environment. This dataset is characterized by 9 attack families and normal traffic captured over two distinct days.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the UNSW-NB15 dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:

- **UNSW-NB15 dataset**:
  > N. Moustafa and J. Slay, “UNSW-NB15: A comprehensive data set for network intrusion detection systems (UNSW-NB15 network data set),” in 2015 military communications and information systems conference (MilCIS), IEEE, 2015, pp. 1–6.

Since this is the only dataset mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the dataset as it is crucial for proper referencing.

After completing these steps, I will have a clear and concise entry for the dataset used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
