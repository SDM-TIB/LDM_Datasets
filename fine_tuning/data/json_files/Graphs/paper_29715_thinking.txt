To extract datasets from the research paper titled "I’m Me, We’re Us, and I’m Us: Tri-directional Contrastive Learning on Hypergraphs" by Dongjin Lee and Kijung Shin, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments using "10 datasets," which indicates that there are multiple datasets to extract.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, specifically **subsection 4.1 (Dataset)**, where the authors provide a detailed list of the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they categorize the datasets into four groups: co-citation datasets, co-authorship datasets, computer vision and graphics datasets, and datasets from the UCI Categorical Machine Learning Repository. 

The datasets mentioned are:

1. **Cora**: A co-citation dataset consisting of papers and their citation links.
2. **Citeseer**: Another co-citation dataset similar to Cora.
3. **Pubmed**: A co-citation dataset focused on medical papers.
4. **Cora-A**: A co-authorship dataset where papers are linked to their authors.
5. **DBLP**: A co-authorship dataset that includes papers and their authors.
6. **Zoo**: A dataset from the UCI Categorical Machine Learning Repository.
7. **20Newsgroups**: A dataset from the UCI Categorical Machine Learning Repository.
8. **Mushroom**: Another dataset from the UCI Categorical Machine Learning Repository.
9. **NTU2012**: A computer vision dataset.
10. **ModelNet40**: Another computer vision dataset.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:

- **Cora**:

Now, I will compile the dataset entries along with their citations into a structured format for further processing.
