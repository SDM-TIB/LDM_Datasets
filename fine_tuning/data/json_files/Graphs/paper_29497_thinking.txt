To extract datasets from the research paper titled "I Know What You Draw: Learning Grasp Detection Conditioned on a Few Freehand Sketches" by Haitao Lin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that experiments were conducted on the **VMRD** and **GraspNet-1Billion** datasets, which suggests that these are key datasets for the research.

Next, I will examine the **methodology** and **experiments** sections, particularly focusing on the **Datasets** subsection. Here, the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used:

1. **VMRD Dataset**: The paper states that the original VMRD dataset contains 4,683 images of cluttered scenes with annotated grasps for 17,000 objects across 31 categories. The dataset is split into a training set of 4,233 images and a testing set of 450 images.

2. **GraspNet-1Billion Dataset**: This dataset is described as containing densely annotated grasp rectangles for multiple object scenes. The authors mention using the test dataset, which includes 90 scenes and 88 objects, with images captured from 256 different dense views.

3. **QuickDraw Dataset**: The authors also mention using the QuickDraw dataset, which consists of 12,000 sketches randomly chosen for each category, split into training and testing sets.

4. **Object Collection**: Additionally, the authors created a collection of 24 household objects to validate their method, which is also relevant to the experiments.

After identifying these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **VMRD Dataset**, the citation is:
  > H. Zhang, X. Lan, X. Zhou, Z. Tian, Y. Zhang, and N. Zheng. *Visual manipulation relationship network for autonomous robotics*. In Proceedings of the IEEE-RAS 18th International Conference on Humanoid Robots (Humanoids), pages 118–125, 2018.

- For the **GraspNet-1Billion Dataset**, the citation is:
  > H.-S. Fang, C. Wang, M. Gou, and C. Lu. *Graspnet-1billion: A large-scale benchmark for general object grasping*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 11,444–11,453, 2020.

- For the **QuickDraw Dataset**, the citation is:
  > J. Jongejan, H. Rowley, T. Kawashima, J. Kim, and N. Fox-Gieg. *The quick, draw!-ai experiment*. URL: http://quickdraw.withgoogle.com, 2016.

Now that I have gathered all necessary information about the datasets, I will compile this into a structured format for further processing or review. This includes ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation.
