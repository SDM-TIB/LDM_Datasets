To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multiresolution Graph Attention Networks for Relevance Matching" by Ting Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors evaluated their model on two datasets, which indicates that I should look for specific names and details of these datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly the subsection titled "5.1 Description of Tasks and Datasets." Here, the authors explicitly mention two datasets used for evaluation:

1. **Ohsumed Dataset**: This dataset consists of 34,394 documents from medical abstracts classified into 23 categories of cardiovascular disease groups. The authors note that they generated topic-document pairs from this dataset for their experiments.

2. **NFCorpus Dataset**: This dataset is described as a full-text English retrieval dataset containing 64,467 samples and 169,756 automatically extracted relevance judgments for 9,964 medical documents. It is specifically used for the task of medical information retrieval.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets:

- For the **Ohsumed Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Hersh, W., Buckley, C., Leone, T. J., & Hickam, D. (1994). OHSUMED: An interactive retrieval evaluation and new large test collection for research. In SIGIR '94. Springer, 192–201.

- For the **NFCorpus Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Boteva, V., Gholipour, D., Sokolov, A., & Riezler, S. (2016). A Full-Text Learning to Rank Dataset for Medical Information Retrieval. In European Conference on Information Retrieval. Springer, 716–722.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets, including their descriptions and citations, ensuring that I maintain clarity and accuracy in the details provided. This will allow for a comprehensive understanding of the datasets used in the research and facilitate further exploration by interested readers.
