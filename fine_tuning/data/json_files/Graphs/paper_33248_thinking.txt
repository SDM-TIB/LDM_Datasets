To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Local-Global History-aware Contrastive Learning for Temporal Knowledge Graph Reasoning" by Wei Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the experimental results are demonstrated on **four benchmark datasets**, which indicates that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section IV), where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they mention:

1. **ICEWS14**: A dataset generated from the Integrated Crisis Early Warning System, containing political events with specific timestamps.
2. **ICEWS18**: Another dataset from the Integrated Crisis Early Warning System, similar to ICEWS14 but covering a different time period.
3. **ICEWS05-15**: A subset of the ICEWS dataset that spans a broader range of years.
4. **GDELT**: A dataset derived from the Global Database of Events, Language datasets, which includes various types of events.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **ICEWS14**:

- For **ICEWS18**:

- For **ICEWS05-15**:

  > Leetaru, K., & Schrodt, P. A. (2013). *GDELT: Global Data on Events, Location, and Tone, 1979-2012*. ISA Annual Convention, 4, 1-49.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations.
