To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Machine-Learning-Driven Runtime Optimization of BLAS Level 3 on Modern Multi-Core Systems" by Yufan Xia and Giuseppe Maria Junior Barca, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will look for any references to datasets used for testing or validation.

Next, I will focus on the **experimentation section** (Section V), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, I will look for specific mentions of datasets, including their sizes, characteristics, and any relevant details about how they were collected or utilized.

In the paper, the authors mention that they gathered data for their experiments on two supercomputing platforms, **Setonix** and **Gadi**, and that the size of the training dataset is between **1000-1200** for each of the BLAS L3 subroutines. This indicates that there are datasets associated with each subroutine tested.

I will also check the **data gathering section** (Section IV) for more details on how the datasets were sampled and the specific characteristics of the data points. The authors mention using a **scrambled Halton sequence** for data sampling, which is important to note.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets or related works mentioned in the paper. This is crucial for providing proper attribution.

For the datasets mentioned in the paper, I will compile the following information:

1. **Dataset Name**: The name of the dataset used (e.g., "Training Dataset for BLAS L3 Subroutines").
2. **Description**: A brief description of the dataset, including its size and characteristics (e.g., "Contains 1000-1200 data points for various BLAS L3 subroutines").
3. **Citation**: The full citation for the dataset or the related work that describes it.

Finally, I will ensure that I format this information clearly and accurately, ready for any downstream processing or review. By following this structured approach, I can effectively extract and document the datasets used in the research paper.
