To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Lightweight Cross-Lingual Sentence Representation Learning" by Zhuoyuan Mao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of "large-scale models" and "cross-lingual sentence representations," which suggests that datasets are likely involved in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors discuss the importance of cross-lingual representation models and mention various tasks that require datasets. However, I need to look for specific dataset names or references.

In the **experiments section**, particularly **section 4.1 (Configuration Details)**, the authors provide details about the training data used. They mention the **ParaCrawl v5.0 datasets** for various language pairs, which is a clear indication of a dataset being utilized. The paper states that they filtered the parallel corpus for each language pair, which is important for understanding the dataset's characteristics.

I will also check the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The relevant citation for the ParaCrawl dataset is:

- For **ParaCrawl v5.0**, the citation is:
  > Marta Ba˜n´on, Pinzhen Chen, Barry Haddow, Kenneth Heaﬁeld, Hieu Hoang, Miquel Espl`a-Gomis, Mikel L. Forcada, Amir Kamran, Faheem Kirefu, Philipp Koehn, Sergio Ortiz Rojas, Leopoldo Pla Sempere, Gema Ram´ırez-S´anchez, Elsa Sarr´ıas, Marek Strelec, Brian Thompson, William Waites, Dion Wiggins, and Jaume Zaragoza. *ParaCrawl: Web-scale acquisition of parallel corpora*. In Proceedings of the 58th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, pages 4555–4567, 2020.

Now, I will summarize the datasets identified:

1. **ParaCrawl v5.0**: This dataset consists of parallel sentences for multiple language pairs, specifically used for training cross-lingual sentence representation models.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the research paper.
