To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Coarse-to-Fine Dual Encoders are Better Frame Identification Learners" by Kaikai An et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and datasets sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors propose a method called COFFTEA and discusses its performance on two FrameNet datasets, which indicates that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. They state that they introduced COFFTEA on two FrameNet datasets: **FN 1.5** and **FN 1.7**. The paper provides a brief description of these datasets, indicating that FN 1.7 is an extensive version of FN 1.5, with more annotated sentences and defined frames.

To ensure I have the correct details, I will look for any additional information in the **experiments section** that might provide insights into the datasets' characteristics, such as the number of examples or specific features. The paper includes a table (Table 1) that summarizes the statistics of the two datasets, which will be useful for my documentation.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets. The citations for the FrameNet datasets are typically attributed to the original FrameNet project papers. I will look for the following citations:

1. For **FrameNet 1.5**:
   > Baker, C. F., Ellsworth, M., & Erk, K. (2007). SemEval-2007 task 19: Frame semantic structure extraction. In Proceedings of the Fourth International Workshop on Semantic Evaluations (SemEval-2007), pages 99–104, Prague, Czech Republic. Association for Computational Linguistics.

2. For **FrameNet 1.7**:
   > Baker, C. F., Fillmore, C. J., & Lowe, J. B. (1998). The Berkeley FrameNet project. In 36th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics and 17th International Conference on Computational Linguistics, Volume 1, pages 86–90, Montreal, Quebec, Canada. Association for Computational Linguistics.

With these citations in hand, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations as required.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for output, ensuring that they are clearly documented and ready for any further processing or review.
