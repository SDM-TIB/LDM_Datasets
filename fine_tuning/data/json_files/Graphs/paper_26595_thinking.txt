To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Customized Graph Neural Networks" by Yiqi Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often highlights the datasets used for experiments. 

In the **introduction**, the authors mention that they conducted experiments on various graph classification benchmarks, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**. Here, the authors explicitly state that they used four representative graph datasets for their study: **D&D**, **ENZ**, **PROT**, and **RE-BI**. I will take note of the context in which these datasets are mentioned, including any specific characteristics or properties that are highlighted.

To ensure I have the correct details, I will also check the **appendices** or **references section** for any additional information regarding these datasets. This may include the original sources or papers where these datasets were introduced or described.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset:

1. **D&D Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Dobson, P. D., & Doig, A. J. (2003). Distinguishing enzyme structures from non-enzymes without alignments. *Journal of Molecular Biology*, 330(4), 771-783.

2. **ENZ Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Shervashidze, N., Schweitzer, P., Leeuwen, E. J. v., Mehlhorn, K., & Borgwardt, K. M. (2011). Weisfeiler-Lehman graph kernels. *Journal of Machine Learning Research*, 12(Sep), 2539-2561.

3. **PROT Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Borgwardt, K. M., Ong, C. S., SchÃ¶nauer, S., Vishwanathan, S., Smola, A. J., & Kriegel, H.-P. (2005). Protein function prediction via graph kernels. *Bioinformatics*, 21(suppl_1).

4. **RE-BI Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Yanardag, P., & Vishwanathan, S. (2015). Deep graph kernels. In *Proceedings of the 21th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining*.

After compiling this information, I will ensure that each dataset is described clearly, including its relevance to the research conducted in the paper. This will help in creating a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the study, along with their proper citations for future reference.
