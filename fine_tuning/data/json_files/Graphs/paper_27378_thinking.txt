To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Contrastive Learning Meets Transfer Learning: A Case Study In Medical Image Analysis" by Yuzhe Lu, Aadarsh Jha, and Yuankai Huo, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. In the abstract, the authors refer to evaluating their method on **CIFAR-10 and HAM10000 datasets**, which indicates that these datasets are central to their research.

Next, I will look into the **introduction section** where the authors discuss the challenges of annotated medical images and mention the datasets used for testing their methods. They specifically state that they evaluated their performance on **CIFAR-10** and **HAM10000**, confirming that these are the datasets of interest.

In the **methods section**, the authors provide details about the datasets. They describe **CIFAR-10** as containing 60,000 32x32 natural images across 10 classes, which is a well-known dataset in the machine learning community. They also describe **HAM10000** as a publicly available dataset consisting of 10,015 dermatoscopic images from seven classes, highlighting its imbalanced nature and how they utilized it for their experiments.

In the **experiments section**, the authors reiterate their use of both datasets, providing further context on how they were employed in their study. This reinforces the importance of these datasets in their research.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
  > Krizhevsky, A. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. Tech. rep. (2009).

- For **HAM10000**, the citation is:
  > Tschandl, P., Rosendahl, C., Kittler, H. *The HAM10000 dataset, a large collection of multi-source dermatoscopic images of common pigmented skin lesions*. Scientific Data 5(1), 1â€“9 (2018).

Having gathered all the necessary information, I will now compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will be done in a structured format for clarity and ease of use in future applications.
