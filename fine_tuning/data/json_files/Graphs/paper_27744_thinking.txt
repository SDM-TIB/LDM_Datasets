To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Superpixel-based Knowledge Infusion in Deep Neural Networks for Image Classification" by Gunjan Chhablani et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the experiments conducted, and the introduction often outlines the datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Empirical Evaluation)**, where the authors describe the datasets used in their experiments. This section is likely to contain detailed descriptions of each dataset, including their characteristics and the specific tasks they are used for.

In **subsection 3.2 (Data)**, the authors list the datasets they tested their model on. I will extract the following datasets:

1. **MNIST**: A widely used dataset for handwritten digit recognition, consisting of 28x28 grayscale images. The authors mention it has 10 classes.

2. **FMNIST (Fashion-MNIST)**: A dataset similar to MNIST but containing images of clothing items, also with 10 classes.

3. **CIFAR-10**: An object recognition dataset with 32x32 RGB images, containing 10 classes.

4. **CIFAR-100**: Similar to CIFAR-10 but with 100 classes.

5. **LFW (Labelled Faces in the Wild)**: A face recognition dataset with RGB images, where the authors filtered out classes with fewer than 20 images, resulting in 62 classes.

6. **SOCOFing (Sokoto Coventry Fingerprint)**: A fingerprint dataset with 6,000 images from 600 subjects.

7. **COVID-19 Radiography**: A dataset containing chest X-ray images for COVID-19 and other conditions, with 4 classes.

After identifying these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited, ready for further processing or review.
