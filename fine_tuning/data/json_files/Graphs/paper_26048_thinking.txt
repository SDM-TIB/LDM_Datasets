To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Recurrent Event Network: Autoregressive Structure Inference over Temporal Knowledge Graphs" by Woojeong Jin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors evaluate their method on "five public datasets," which indicates that there are multiple datasets to extract.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments** section. In this paper, the authors mention using five datasets for evaluation: **ICEWS18**, **ICEWS14**, **GDELT**, **WIKI**, and **YAGO**. I will note down these names and any relevant details provided about each dataset.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide a summary of the datasets used, including their characteristics. I will extract the following details for each dataset:

1. **ICEWS18**: This dataset is described as having 1,734,399 training events, with a time gap of 15 minutes.
2. **ICEWS14**: This dataset has 323,895 training events and a time gap of 24 hours.
3. **GDELT**: This dataset contains 1,734,399 training events and also has a time gap of 15 minutes.
4. **WIKI**: This dataset has 539,286 training events and a time gap of 1 year.
5. **YAGO**: This dataset contains 161,540 training events and also has a time gap of 1 year.

Next, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- **ICEWS18**: 
  > Boschee, E., Lautenschlager, J., O’Brien, S., Shellman, S., Starz, J., & Ward, M. (2015). *ICEWS Coded Event Data*. Harvard Dataverse.

- **ICEWS14**: 
  > Trivedi, R., Dai, H., Wang, Y., & Song, L. (2017). *Know-evolve: Deep temporal reasoning for dynamic knowledge graphs*. In ICML.

- **GDELT**: 
  > Leetaru, K., & Schrodt, P. A. (2013). *GDELT: Global data on events, location, and tone, 1979–2012*. In ISA annual convention.

- **WIKI**: 
  > Leblay, J., & Chekol, M. W. (2018). *Deriving validity time in knowledge graph*. In Companion of the The Web Conference 2018.

- **YAGO**: 
  > Mahdisoltani, F., & Suchanek, F. M. (2014). *YAGO3: A knowledge base from multilingual wikipedias*. In CIDR.

Now that I have gathered the dataset names, descriptions, and citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference and further processing. This ensures that I have accurately captured all relevant details about the datasets used in the research paper.
