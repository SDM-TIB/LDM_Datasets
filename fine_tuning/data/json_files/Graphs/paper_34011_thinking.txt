To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CO3: Low-resource Contrastive Co-training for Generative Conversational Query Rewrite" by Yifei Yuan et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, and the introduction often discusses the datasets used in the context of the research problem.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention the challenges of generative query rewriting and the need for labeled data. However, I need to look for specific dataset names and details.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, particularly the subsection titled **4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the datasets used in their experiments. Here, I find the following datasets:

1. **TREC CAst Dataset**: This dataset contains 50 conversational sessions and 479 queries, each associated with a manual rewrite. It is explicitly mentioned as a labeled dataset used for experiments.

2. **CANARD Dataset**: The authors mention using a sampled version of the original dev set from the QUAC training set, which contains 515 query-rewrite pairs. This dataset is also labeled and used in their experiments.

3. **MS MARCO Dataset**: This dataset is used for the Simplifier model, consisting of 9306 sessions with 13799 different queries. It is noted that the queries in this dataset do not contain information omission.

4. **QUAC Dataset**: This dataset is used for the Rewriter model, consisting of 1000 unique sessions with 7354 queries. The authors indicate that this dataset contains queries with coreference and ellipsis.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **TREC CAst Dataset**:

  > Eunsol Choi, He He, Mohit Iyyer, Mark Yatskar, Wen-tau Yih, Yejin Choi, Percy Liang, and Luke Zettlemoyer. *Quac: Question answering in context*. In EMNLP, 2018.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This systematic approach ensures that I capture all relevant details about the datasets used in the research paper.
