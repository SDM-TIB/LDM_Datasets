To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Knowledge-Enhanced Contextual Language Representations for Domain Natural Language Understanding" by Taolin Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, and the introduction typically outlines the context and significance of the work, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will pay particular attention to **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors usually detail the datasets used for their experiments. This section often contains specific information about the datasets, including their names, sizes, and any relevant characteristics.

In this paper, I notice that the authors mention two closed-domain knowledge graphs: **MedKG** and **FinKG**. I will extract the relevant details about these datasets:

1. **MedKG**: This dataset is described as a medical knowledge graph containing disease-related entities, including diseases, drugs, symptoms, cures, and pharmaceutical factories. It consists of 43,972 entities and 296,625 triples.

2. **FinKG**: This dataset is a financial knowledge graph that includes entities related to companies, industries, products, people, and positions. It contains 9,413 entities and 18,175 triples.

After identifying these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. However, since these datasets are constructed by the authors themselves, they may not have traditional citations like published datasets. Instead, I will note the details provided in the paper.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset names, descriptions, and any relevant statistics such as the number of entities and triples.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for review or downstream processing, ensuring that all necessary details are included for each dataset.
