To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Self-Supervised Consistent Quantization for Fully Unsupervised Image Retrieval" by Guile Wu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4), where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they mention three datasets:

1. **CIFAR-10**: This dataset consists of 60,000 images across 10 classes, with each class containing 5,000 training images and 1,000 testing images.

2. **NUS-WIDE**: This is a multi-label dataset containing around 270,000 images across 81 categories. For evaluation, the authors selected images from the 21 most frequent categories, resulting in a query set of 21,000 images.

3. **FLICKR25K**: This dataset contains 25,000 images across 24 categories. The authors randomly selected 2,000 images as the query set.

I will then verify the details of these datasets in the **References section** to ensure I can provide accurate citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. Technical report, 2009.

- For **NUS-WIDE**, the citation is:
  > Tat-Seng Chua, Jinhui Tang, Richang Hong, Haojie Li, Zhiping Luo, and Yantao Zheng. *NUS-WIDE: A real-world web image database from national university of singapore*. In Proceedings of the ACM international conference on image and video retrieval, pages 1–9, 2009.

- For **FLICKR25K**, the citation is:
  > Mark J Huiskes and Michael S Lew. *The mir flickr retrieval evaluation*. In Proceedings of the 1st ACM international conference on Multimedia Information Retrieval, pages 39–43, 2008.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that highlights each dataset's name, description, and full citation. This will ensure that I have accurately captured all necessary details for further processing or review.
