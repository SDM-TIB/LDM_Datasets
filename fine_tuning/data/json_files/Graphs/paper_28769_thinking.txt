To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Dual Contrastive Learning for General Face Forgery Detection" by Ke Sun et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the importance of face forgery detection and hints at the use of various datasets for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the datasets used. In this section, they mention five datasets:

1. **FaceForensics++**: This dataset contains 720 videos for training and 280 videos for validation or testing. It includes various face synthesis methods, making it suitable for generalization experiments.

2. **Celeb-DF**: This dataset consists of 590 real videos and 5639 fake videos generated through face swapping for 59 subjects.

3. **DFDC (DeepFake Detection Challenge)**: This large-scale dataset includes 1133 real videos and 4080 fake videos created using various manipulation methods.

4. **DFD (Deepfake Dataset)**: This dataset comprises 363 real videos and 3068 fake videos.

5. **Wild Deepfake**: This dataset contains 3805 real face sequences and 3509 fake face sequences, sourced from the internet, showcasing a variety of synthesis methods and backgrounds.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for the full citations of each dataset. The citations are as follows:

- For **FaceForensics++**, the citation is:

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their respective citations from the paper.
