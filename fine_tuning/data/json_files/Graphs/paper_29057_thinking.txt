To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Confidence Based Bidirectional Global Context Aware Training Framework for Neural Machine Translation" by Chulun Zhou et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information accurately, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. In the abstract, the authors refer to "three large-scale translation datasets," which indicates that datasets are indeed present in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 3) where the authors discuss the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they explicitly mention the three datasets:

1. **WMT’14 English-to-German**: The authors describe this dataset as containing about 4.5 million parallel sentence pairs, with specific validation and test sets mentioned.

2. **WMT’19 Chinese-to-English**: This dataset consists of approximately 20 million sentence pairs, with validation and test sets also specified.

3. **WMT’14 English-to-French**: The authors note that this dataset contains around 36 million parallel sentence pairs, along with its validation and test sets.

I will then check the **appendix** (Appendix A) for more detailed information about each dataset, including preprocessing steps and any additional statistics provided. This will help me ensure that I have comprehensive descriptions for each dataset.

After gathering the necessary details, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations for the WMT datasets are typically attributed to the conference proceedings where they were introduced or the official WMT website.

The full citations I will include are:

- For **WMT’14 English-to-German**:
  > Bojar, O., et al. (2014). *Findings of the 2014 Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation*. In Proceedings of the Ninth Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation, pages 1-12.

- For **WMT’19 Chinese-to-English**:
  > Barrault, L., et al. (2019). *Findings of the 2019 Conference on Machine Translation (WMT)*. In Proceedings of the Fourth Conference on Machine Translation, pages 1-28.

- For **WMT’14 English-to-French**:
  > Bojar, O., et al. (2014). *Findings of the 2014 Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation*. In Proceedings of the Ninth Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation, pages 1-12.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their descriptions and citations into a structured format for further processing or review.
