To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Blindfolded Attackers Still Threatening: Strict Black-Box Adversarial Attacks on Graphs" by Jiarong Xu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for experiments or evaluations.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, I will look for specific names of datasets, their characteristics, and any relevant statistics that provide context about their use in the research.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **Cora-ML Dataset**: This dataset is a citation network consisting of 2,810 vertices, 7,981 edges, 7 classes, and 1,433 features. It is used for node classification tasks.

2. **Citeseer Dataset**: Another citation network, this dataset contains 2,110 vertices, 3,757 edges, 6 classes, and 3,703 features, also used for node classification tasks.

3. **Polblogs Dataset**: This web network dataset includes 1,222 vertices, 16,714 edges, 2 classes, and no features, used for node classification tasks.

4. **Proteins Dataset**: This dataset represents protein networks with 1,113 graphs, 2 classes, 3 features, an average of 39.06 nodes, and 72.82 edges per graph.

5. **Enzymes Dataset**: Another protein network dataset, it consists of 600 graphs, 6 classes, 3 features, an average of 32.63 nodes, and 62.14 edges per graph.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and further exploration of the datasets.

- For **Cora-ML**, the citation is:
  > Sen, P., Wang, Z., & Yang, J. (2008). *Collective classification in network data*. In Proceedings of the 2008 SIAM International Conference on Data Mining.

- For **Citeseer**, the citation is:
  > Sen, P., Wang, Z., & Yang, J. (2008). *Collective classification in network data*. In Proceedings of the 2008 SIAM International Conference on Data Mining.

- For **Polblogs**, the citation is:
  > Adamic, L. A., & Glance, N. (2005). *The political blogosphere and the 2004 US election: divided they blog*. In Proceedings of the 3rd International Workshop on Link Discovery.

- For **Proteins**, the citation is:
  > Borgwardt, K. M., & Kriegel, H. P. (2005). *Shortest-path kernels on graphs*. In Proceedings of the Fifth IEEE International Conference on Data Mining.

- For **Enzymes**, the citation is:
  > Schomburg, I., & Chang, A. (2004). *Enzyme data from BRENDA: a comprehensive enzyme database*. In Nucleic Acids Research.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described with its full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I capture all relevant details for each dataset mentioned in the paper.
