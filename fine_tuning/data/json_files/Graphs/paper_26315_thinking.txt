To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Decompressing Knowledge Graph Representations for Link Prediction" by Xiang Kong et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the experimental results are based on "several benchmark knowledge graphs," which indicates that datasets are involved. The introduction further elaborates on knowledge bases like Freebase, WordNet, and Yago, suggesting that these may be the datasets used.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments** section. In the experiments section, the authors explicitly state that they evaluate their method on two benchmark datasets: **FB15k-237** and **WN18RR**. This is a clear indication that these are the datasets used for their experiments.

Now, I will gather detailed information about each dataset. The paper provides some context about these datasets:
1. **FB15k-237**: This dataset is derived from the original FB15k dataset, which contains a large number of inverse relations. The authors mention that FB15k-237 has 14,541 entities and 237 types of relations.
2. **WN18RR**: This dataset is a refined version of WN18, which has been modified to remove reverse relations. It contains 40,934 entities and 11 types of relations.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **FB15k-237**, the citation is:
  > Toutanova, K., and Chen, D. (2015). Observed versus latent features for knowledge base and text inference. In Proceedings of the 3rd Workshop on Continuous Vector Space Models and their Compositionality, 57â€“66.

- For **WN18RR**, the citation is:
  > Dettmers, T., Minervini, P., Stenetorp, P., and Riedel, S. (2018). Convolutional 2D knowledge graph embeddings. In Thirty-Second AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence.

With this information, I will now compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
