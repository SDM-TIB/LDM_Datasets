To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Neural Separation Algorithm for the Rounded Capacity Inequalities" by Hyeonah Kim et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions a "learning-based separation heuristic algorithm" and references "computational results," which suggests that datasets may be involved.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for training and testing their models. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and any specific characteristics that are relevant to the research.

In the **experiments section**, the authors often provide details about the datasets used in their experiments. I will look for specific datasets mentioned, including any performance metrics or results associated with them. This section may also include comparisons with other methods, which can help confirm the datasets' relevance.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for future researchers who may want to access these datasets.

For example, if the paper mentions using a dataset like the "CVRPLIB" for testing, I would look for the citation that corresponds to this dataset. The citation might look something like this:
> Lima, I., Uchoa, E., Pecin, D., Pessoa, A., Poggi, M., Vidal, T., Subramanian, A., W, R., Oliveira, D., and Queiroga, E. (2014). *CVRPLIB: Capacitated vehicle routing problem library*. Last checked on October 6, 2022.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, including their names, descriptions, and citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference.

Finally, I will ensure that each dataset entry includes the full citation, as this is essential for academic integrity and for others to locate the datasets used in the research.
