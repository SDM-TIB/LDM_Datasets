To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SoundCLR: Contrastive Learning of Representations For Improved Environmental Sound Classification" by Alireza Nasiri and Jianjun Hu, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors achieved state-of-the-art performance on three benchmark datasets: **ESC-10, ESC-50, and US8K**. This suggests that these datasets are crucial for their research.

Next, I will look closely at the **experiments section** (specifically section IV) where the authors describe the datasets in detail. Here, they provide specific information about each dataset:

1. **ESC-50**: This dataset consists of 2000 audio samples, each 5 seconds long, divided into 50 classes. The classes are balanced across five folds, with each fold containing 8 samples per class. The sampling rate is 44.1 kHz.

2. **ESC-10**: This is a subset of ESC-50, containing 400 samples across 10 classes, also divided into five folds. Each sample is 5 seconds long.

3. **UrbanSound8K (US8K)**: This dataset includes 8732 audio samples from 10 different classes, with varying lengths (maximum of 4 seconds). The classes include various urban sounds like air conditioner, car horn, and dog bark.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **ESC-50**:
  > K. J. Piczak. *ESC: Dataset for Environmental Sound Classification*. In Proceedings of the 23rd ACM International Conference on Multimedia, 2015, pp. 1015–1018.

- For **ESC-10**:
  > K. J. Piczak. *ESC: Dataset for Environmental Sound Classification*. In Proceedings of the 23rd ACM International Conference on Multimedia, 2015, pp. 1015–1018. (Note: ESC-10 is a subset of ESC-50, so it shares the same citation.)

- For **UrbanSound8K (US8K)**:
  > J. Salamon, C. Jacoby, and J. P. Bello. *A Dataset and Taxonomy for Urban Sound Research*. In Proceedings of the 22nd ACM International Conference on Multimedia, 2014, pp. 1041–1044.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this into a structured format for further processing.
