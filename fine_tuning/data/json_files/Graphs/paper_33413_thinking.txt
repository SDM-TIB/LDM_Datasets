To extract datasets from the research paper titled "PEPT: Expert Finding Meets Personalized Pre-training" by Qiyao Peng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the method has been evaluated on **six real-world CQA datasets**, which indicates that datasets are involved, but I need to find their specific names and details.

Next, I will look into **section 5 (Experimental Settings)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention that they used a dataset comprising **103,005 experts extracted from StackExchange**, which is used for pre-training expert representations. They also specify six distinct domains for evaluation: **English, Biology, Es, Electronics, Gis, and CodeReview**.

In this section, the authors provide statistical details about each dataset, including the number of questions, answerers, answers, and average title length. This information is crucial for understanding the datasets' characteristics.

Now, I will compile the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper does not provide specific citations for the datasets themselves, but it references the source of the expert data as **StackExchange**. Therefore, I will cite the StackExchange dataset as follows:

- **StackExchange Dataset**: 
  > Stack Exchange. *Stack Exchange Data Dump*. Available at: https://archive.org/details/stackexchange

Next, I will summarize the datasets based on the information provided in the paper:

1. **StackExchange Dataset**: This dataset includes 103,005 experts and their historical answered questions across various domains, specifically used for pre-training expert representations.

2. **English Domain Dataset**: Contains questions related to the English language, with specific statistics provided in the paper.

3. **Biology Domain Dataset**: Contains questions related to biology, with specific statistics provided in the paper.

4. **Es Domain Dataset**: Contains questions related to Spanish language or culture, with specific statistics provided in the paper.

5. **Electronics Domain Dataset**: Contains questions related to electronics, with specific statistics provided in the paper.

6. **Gis Domain Dataset**: Contains questions related to geographic information systems, with specific statistics provided in the paper.

7. **CodeReview Domain Dataset**: Contains questions related to code reviews, with specific statistics provided in the paper.

Finally, I will ensure that I have accurately documented the datasets and their characteristics, ready for any further processing or analysis. This structured approach will help in extracting and presenting the datasets effectively.
