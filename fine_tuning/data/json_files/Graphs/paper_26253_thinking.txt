To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MONET: Debiasing Graph Embeddings via the Metadata-Orthogonal Training Unit" by John Palowitch and Bryan Perozzi, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses experiments on various real-world graphs, which suggests that datasets are involved, but I need to find specific names.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors describe their experiments on two specific datasets:

1. **Political Blogs Graph**: This dataset consists of a network of political blogs, with 1,107 nodes representing blog websites and 19,034 edges representing hyperlinks between them. The authors mention that this dataset is used to evaluate the effectiveness of their MONET method in debiasing embeddings related to political affiliations.

2. **MovieLens 100k Dataset**: This dataset is a well-known benchmark in recommendation systems, consisting of 943 users and 1,682 movies, with a total of 100,000 ratings. The authors use this dataset to demonstrate the effectiveness of their method against shilling attacks in recommender systems.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for these datasets are as follows:

- For the **Political Blogs Graph**, the citation is:
  > Adamic, L. A., & Glance, N. (2005). The political blogosphere and the 2004 US election: divided they blog. In Proceedings of the 3rd International Workshop on Link Discovery (pp. 36–43). ACM.

- For the **MovieLens 100k Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Harper, F. M., & Konstan, J. A. (2009). The MovieLens Datasets: History and Context. ACM SIGKDD Explorations Newsletter, 5(1), 1–10.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their proper references.
