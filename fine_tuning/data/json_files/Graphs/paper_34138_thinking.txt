To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Spin-UP: Spin Light for Natural Light Uncalibrated Photometric Stereo" by Zongrui Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section 4) closely, as this is where datasets are typically described. In Section 4.1, the authors mention that they collected a synthetic dataset using Blender, which includes various objects, materials, and environment maps. They also specify that the dataset is categorized into four groups: shape group, light group, reflectance group, and spatially varying material group. 

I will note the specific datasets mentioned:
1. **DiLiGenT-MV Dataset**: This dataset includes five shapes (BUDDHA, BEAR, COW, POT2, and READING) used for rendering the synthetic dataset.
2. **HDR Environment Maps**: The authors list five HDR environment maps (LANDSCAPE, QUARRY, URBAN, ATTIC, STUDIO) used in their experiments.
3. **Materials**: They mention two PBR materials (RUSTY STEEL, LEATHER) and four synthetic materials (VORONOI DIFF, VORONOI SPEC, GREEN DIFF, GREEN SPEC) used for evaluation.

In Section 4.2, the authors describe the real-world dataset, which consists of five objects (SOLDIER, PLAYER, POLICEMAN, DANCER, and EEVEE) captured under various lighting conditions. This section provides insight into the practical application of their method and the datasets used for real-world validation.

Next, I will refer to the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **DiLiGenT-MV Dataset**:
  > Min Li, Zhenglong Zhou, Zhe Wu, Boxin Shi, Changyu Diao, and Ping Tan. *Multi-view photometric stereo: A robust solution and benchmark dataset for spatially varying isotropic materials*. IEEE Transactions on Image Processing (TIP), 2020.

- For the **HDR Environment Maps**:
  > The specific HDR environment maps used are not attributed to a single source in the paper, but they are commonly available datasets in the field of computer graphics.

- For the **PBR Materials**:
  > The materials used (RUSTY STEEL, LEATHER) are standard materials in rendering and may not have specific citations, but they are often referenced in the context of physically based rendering.

- For the **Synthetic Materials**:
  > The synthetic materials (VORONOI DIFF, VORONOI SPEC, GREEN DIFF, GREEN SPEC) are also standard in the rendering community and may not have specific citations.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research, ready for further processing or review.
