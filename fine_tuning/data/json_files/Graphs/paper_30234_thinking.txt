To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Graph Contrastive Learning with Personalized Augmentation" by Xin Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments across **11 benchmark graphs from different types and domains**, indicating that multiple datasets are involved. This prompts me to look for specific dataset names and details.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section 5) where the authors describe their evaluation methodology. In **Section 5.1.1 (Datasets)**, the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. They mention:

1. **NCI1**: A dataset consisting of chemical compounds represented as graphs.
2. **MUTAG**: A dataset of mutagenic activity of chemical compounds.
3. **PROTEINS**: A dataset of protein structures represented as graphs.
4. **COLLAB**: A dataset of collaboration networks.
5. **IMDB-BINARY**: A dataset of movie collaboration networks.
6. **REDDIT-BINARY**: A dataset of Reddit posts.
7. **REDDIT-MULTI-5K**: A multi-class version of the Reddit dataset.
8. **GITHUB**: A dataset of GitHub repositories.
9. **ogbg-molhiv**: A dataset from the Open Graph Benchmark focusing on molecular graphs.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For the datasets mentioned, I will compile the following citations:

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets and their citations in a structured format for easy reference and further processing.
