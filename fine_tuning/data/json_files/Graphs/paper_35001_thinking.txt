To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Semi-Supervised Contrastive Learning of Musical Representations" by Julien Guinot et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the introduction of a method for leveraging labeled data in contrastive learning, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used in their experiments. This section is crucial as it provides detailed information about each dataset, including their purpose and characteristics.

The datasets mentioned in this section are:

1. **Free Music Archive (FMA)**: Used as a self-supervised dataset, specifically the medium subset containing 25,000 clips of 30 seconds of audio.
   
2. **MagnaTagATune (MTAT)**: A labeled dataset used for automatic tagging, with a canonical 12:3:1 train-test-validation split.

3. **MTG-Jamendo**: Another tagging dataset that includes various subsets based on genre, mood/theme, and instrument.

4. **NSynth**: A dataset used for pitch and instrument classification of short audio snippets.

5. **MedleyDB**: Utilized for instrument classification with longer audio clips.

6. **Giantsteps**: A dataset for key classification, where the original dataset is used for training and the MTG-Giantsteps dataset for testing.

7. **GTZAN**: A fault-filtered dataset used for genre classification.

8. **VocalSet**: A dataset used for singer identification and technique classification.

9. **EmoMusic**: Used for regressing Arousal (A) and Valence (V) as a downstream evaluation task.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is essential for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets.

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this into a structured format for further processing or review.
