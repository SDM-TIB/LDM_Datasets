To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Attention-guided Multi-step Fusion: A Hierarchical Fusion Network for Multimodal Recommendation" by Yan Zhou et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted extensive experiments on three real-world datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. They state that they conducted experiments on three widely used category subsets of the Amazon review dataset, specifically:

1. **Baby**: This dataset is a subset of the Amazon review dataset focused on baby products.
2. **Sports and Outdoors**: Another subset of the Amazon review dataset that includes products related to sports and outdoor activities.
3. **Clothing, Shoes and Jewelry**: This subset encompasses various clothing and accessory items from the Amazon review dataset.

In this section, the authors provide a brief description of how they utilized these datasets for their experiments, including the metrics used for evaluation.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Amazon review dataset, as it is the source for all three subsets mentioned. The citation for the Amazon review dataset is:

- For the Amazon review dataset, the citation is:
  > Julian McAuley, Christopher Targett, Qinfeng Shi, and Anton Van Den Hengel. *Image-based recommendations on styles and substitutes*. In Proceedings of the 38th international ACM SIGIR conference on research and development in information retrieval, pages 43â€“52, 2015.

Since all three datasets (Baby, Sports and Outdoors, Clothing, Shoes and Jewelry) are subsets of the Amazon review dataset, I will use this citation for each of them.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes the full citation. This will allow for a clear and structured presentation of the datasets used in the research.
