To extract datasets from the research paper titled "GREED: A Neural Framework for Learning Graph Distance Functions" by Rishabh Ranjan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the datasets used in the research. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments across **10 real graph datasets**, which indicates that multiple datasets are involved.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments** section. In this paper, there is a **section 4.1 (Experimental Setup)** that lists the datasets used for benchmarking. Here, the authors provide a table (Table A) that summarizes the datasets, including their average number of nodes and edges.

The datasets mentioned in the paper are:

1. **Dblp**: A co-authorship network where each node is an author and edges represent co-authorship.
2. **Amazon**: A product co-purchase network where nodes represent products.
3. **PubMed**: A citation network of scientific publications related to diabetes.
4. **CiteSeer**: A citation network of scientific publications.
5. **Cora_ML**: A smaller version of the Cora dataset, which is also a citation dataset.
6. **Protein**: A dataset consisting of protein graphs.
7. **AIDS**: Graphs constructed from the AIDS antiviral screen database.
8. **AIDSâ€™**: Another collection of graphs from the AIDS antiviral screen database.
9. **Linux**: A collection of program dependence graphs.
10. **IMDB**: A collection of ego-networks of actors/actresses.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. However, the paper does not provide specific citations for each dataset, as some datasets like Dblp and PubMed are well-known and publicly available. For the others, I will note that they are derived from specific databases or repositories.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with the relevant information, including the dataset names and descriptions, while ensuring to mention that some datasets do not have formal citations but are widely recognized in the research community.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for further processing or review.
