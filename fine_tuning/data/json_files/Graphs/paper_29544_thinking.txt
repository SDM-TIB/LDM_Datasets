To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Plane Geometry Diagram Parsing" by Ming-Liang Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors built a new large-scale geometry diagram dataset named **PGDP5K** with primitive-level annotations, which indicates that this is a primary dataset of interest.

Next, I will look for specific details about the **PGDP5K dataset** in the **Datasets section (Section 4)**. Here, the authors provide a comprehensive description of the dataset, including its size (5,000 diagram samples), the sources of the images (1,813 images from the Geometry3K dataset and 3,187 images from textbooks), and the dataset's structure (train, validation, and test splits). This section confirms that PGDP5K is indeed a significant dataset used in their experiments.

Additionally, I will check for any other datasets mentioned in the paper. The authors reference an existing dataset called **IMP-Geometry3K**, which they re-annotated for their study. This dataset is also relevant and should be included in my extraction.

Now, I will gather the full citations for both datasets from the **References section**:

1. For **PGDP5K**, the citation is:
   > Ming-Liang Zhang, Fei Yin, Yi-Han Hao, and Cheng-Lin Liu. *PGDP5K: A Large-Scale Geometry Diagram Dataset for Plane Geometry Diagram Parsing*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2023.

2. For **IMP-Geometry3K**, the citation is:
   > Minjoon Seo, Hannaneh Hajishirzi, Ali Farhadi, and Oren Etzioni. *Solving Geometry Problems: Combining Text and Diagram Interpretation*. In EMNLP, 2015.

With these citations in hand, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described accurately and includes the necessary citation information. This structured approach will help maintain clarity and ensure that all relevant datasets are documented properly for future reference or analysis.
