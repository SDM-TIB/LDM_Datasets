To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ACE: Zero-Shot Image to Image Translation via Pretrained Auto-Contrastive-Encoder" by Sihan Xu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the method's effectiveness in zero-shot image translation, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.2 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they state that their method achieves satisfactory results on the **Yosemite summer⇔winter**, **apple⇔orange**, and **Animal Face** datasets. This section is crucial as it provides the names of the datasets directly.

I will then look for additional details about these datasets in the paper. The authors mention that the **Animal Face dataset** includes data of big cats, cats, and dogs, which is important for understanding the dataset's scope.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is essential for proper attribution and to provide readers with sources for further exploration.

The citations I will extract are:

- For the **Yosemite summer⇔winter dataset**, the citation is:
  > Xun Huang, Ming-Yu Liu, Serge Belongie, and Jan Kautz. *Multimodal unsupervised image-to-image translation*. In Proceedings of the European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), September 2018.

- For the **apple⇔orange dataset**, the citation is:
  > Jun-Yan Zhu, Taesung Park, Phillip Isola, and Alexei A. Efros. *Unpaired image-to-image translation using cycle-consistent adversarial networks*. In 2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 2242–2251, 2017.

- For the **Animal Face dataset**, the citation is:
  > Ming-Yu Liu, Xun Huang, Arun Mallya, Tero Karras, Timo Aila, Jaakko Lehtinen, and Jan Kautz. *Few-shot unsupervised image-to-image translation*. In 2019 IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 10550–10559, 2019.

Now that I have gathered the dataset names and their corresponding citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and provided proper citations for each.
