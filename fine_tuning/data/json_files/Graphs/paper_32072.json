A user interaction is defined as watching a program, an item is defined as a program, and a session is defined as a sequence of program viewing records. In raw data, sessions are randomly divided with 180 seconds interval because sessions were not previously divided. In addition, TV programs that appeared less than 5 times out of all viewing records were excluded, and data with a session length of 2 or more were used. For each user, we sort the viewing sequence in chronological order, and 80 percent of the previous session was used as a train set and 20 percent of the next session as a test set. TVwatching dataset is private and not gonna be publicly released.",
