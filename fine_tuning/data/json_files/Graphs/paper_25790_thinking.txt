To extract datasets from the research paper titled "KBGAN: Adversarial Learning for Knowledge Graph Embeddings" by Liwei Cai and William Yang Wang, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method on three knowledge base completion datasets: **FB15k-237**, **WN18**, and **WN18RR**. This is a clear indication that these datasets are crucial to the research.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (specifically section 4.1.1) where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they confirm the use of the same three datasets: **FB15k-237**, **WN18**, and **WN18RR**. The authors also provide some context about these datasets, mentioning that FB15k-237 is a subset of FB15k and WN18RR is a subset of WN18, which adds to the understanding of their relevance.

I will then check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **FB15k-237**, the citation is:
  > Kurt Bollacker, Colin Evans, Praveen Paritosh, Tim Sturge, and Jamie Taylor. *Freebase: a collaboratively created graph database for structuring human knowledge*. In Proceedings of the 2008 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data, pages 1247–1250, 2008.

- For **WN18**, the citation is:
  > Antoine Bordes, Nicolas Usunier, Alberto Garcia-Duran, Jason Weston, and Oksana Yakhnenko. *Translating embeddings for modeling multi-relational data*. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, pages 2787–2795, 2013.

- For **WN18RR**, the citation is:
  > Tim Dettmers, Pasquale Minervini, Pontus Stenetorp, and Sebastian Riedel. *Convolutional 2D knowledge graph embeddings*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1707.01476, 2017.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their full citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
