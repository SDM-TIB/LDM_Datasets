To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Alchemy: A Quantum Chemistry Dataset for Benchmarking AI Models" by Guangyong Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the creation of a new molecular dataset called **Alchemy**, which contains quantum mechanical properties of 119,487 organic molecules. This indicates that the Alchemy dataset is a primary focus of the paper.

Next, I will look into **section 4 (The Alchemy Dataset)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset. Here, they describe the dataset's composition, including the number of molecules, the types of properties measured, and the source of the molecules (GDB MedChem database). This section confirms that the Alchemy dataset is indeed the main dataset discussed in the paper.

In addition to the Alchemy dataset, the authors also mention several related datasets in **section 2 (Related Datasets)**. These include:

1. **QM7 Dataset**: Contains 7,165 molecules, a subset of GDB-13, used for predicting a single electronic property, the atomization energy.
2. **QM7b Dataset**: An extension of QM7 with additional properties computed at different levels of accuracy.
3. **QM8 Dataset**: Comprises 21,786 molecules with electronic properties and excited-state properties for multi-task learning.
4. **QM9 Dataset**: Contains 133,885 organic molecules with various properties, including geometric and energetic properties.

I will then check the **References section** to gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

- For the **Alchemy dataset**, since it is introduced in this paper, I will cite it as:
  > Guangyong Chen, Pengfei Chen, Chang-Yu Hsieh, Chee-Kong Lee, Benben Liao, Renjie Liao, Weiwen Liu, Jiezhong Qiu, Qiming Sun, Jie Tang, Richard Zemel, Shengyu Zhang. *Alchemy: A Quantum Chemistry Dataset for Benchmarking AI Models*. Preprint. Under review.

- For the **QM7 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Ramakrishnan, R., Dral, P. O., Rupp, M., and Von Lilienfeld, O. A. *Quantum Chemistry Structures and Properties of 134 Kilo Molecules*. Scientific Data, 1:140022, 2014.

- For the **QM7b Dataset**, it is an extension of QM7, so I will use the same citation as QM7.

- For the **QM8 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Wu, Z., Ramsundar, B., Feinberg, E. N., Gomes, J., Geniesse, C., Pappu, A. S., Leswing, K., and Pande, V. *MoleculeNet: a Benchmark for Molecular Machine Learning*. Chemical Science, 9(2):513–530, 2018.

- For the **QM9 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Ruddigkeit, L., Van Deursen, R., Blum, L. C., and Reymond, J.-L. *Enumeration of 166 billion organic small molecules in the chemical universe database gdb-17*. Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling, 52(11):2864–2875, 2012.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This structured approach will help in accurately documenting the datasets for future reference or analysis.
