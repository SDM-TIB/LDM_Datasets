To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Differentiable Hierarchical Graph Grouping for Multi-Person Pose Estimation" by Sheng Jin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the proposed method is evaluated on both the **COCO** and **OCHuman** datasets, indicating that these are the datasets I need to focus on.

Next, I will look specifically in **section 4.1 (Datasets and Evaluation)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used for their experiments. Here, I will find the following information:

1. **MS-COCO Dataset**: The authors describe it as containing over 200,000 images and 250,000 human instances, with 1.7 million labeled keypoints. They specify that 150,000 instances are for training and 80,000 for testing.

2. **OCHuman Dataset**: This dataset is noted to consist of 4,731 images for validation and 8,110 images for testing, specifically designed to evaluate human pose detection in challenging scenarios.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **MS-COCO Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Lin, T.Y., Maire, M., Belongie, S., Hays, J., Perona, P., Ramanan, D., DollÃ¡r, P., Zitnick, C.L. (2014). *Microsoft COCO: Common objects in context*. In European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV).

- For the **OCHuman Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Insafutdinov, E., Andriluka, M., Pishchulin, L., Tang, S., Levinkov, E., Andres, B., Schiele, B. (2017). *ArtTrack: Articulated multi-person tracking in the wild*. In The IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR).

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will prepare to compile this information into the required format for further processing or review.
