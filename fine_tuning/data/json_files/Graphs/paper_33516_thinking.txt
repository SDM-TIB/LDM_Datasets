To extract datasets from the research paper titled "QoS-Aware Graph Contrastive Learning for Web Service Recommendation" by Jeongwhan Choi and Duksan Ryu, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the use of a dataset called **WSDream**, which is a clear indication that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will look for specific details about the **WSDream dataset** in the **experiments section**. Here, the authors provide information about the dataset, including its characteristics and how it was used in their experiments. They mention that the dataset is used for evaluating the performance of their proposed model in both warm-start and cold-start scenarios.

In the **experiments section**, the authors describe the dataset as follows:
- **WSDream**: This dataset is used for web service QoS prediction and includes various user-service interactions based on response times. It is structured to facilitate both warm-start and cold-start testing environments, with specific thresholds for determining interactions.

The authors also provide detailed statistics about the dataset, including the number of users, services, and interactions, which are crucial for understanding the dataset's scope.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the WSDream dataset. The citation is provided as follows:
> Zheng, Z., Ma, H., Lyu, M. R., & King, I. (2012). Collaborative web service QoS prediction via neighborhood integrated matrix factorization. *IEEE Transactions on Services Computing*, 6(3), 289-299.

With this information, I can summarize the dataset extraction as follows:

1. **Dataset Name**: WSDream
   - **Description**: A dataset for web service QoS prediction, structured for both warm-start and cold-start environments, based on user-service interactions and response times.
   - **Full Citation**: Zheng, Z., Ma, H., Lyu, M. R., & King, I. (2012). Collaborative web service QoS prediction via neighborhood integrated matrix factorization. *IEEE Transactions on Services Computing*, 6(3), 289-299.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
