To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fast and Provable Tensor Robust Principal Component Analysis via Scaled Gradient Descent" by Harry Dong et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and numerical experiments sections** to find any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors demonstrate their algorithm through "synthetic experiments and real-world applications," which suggests that there may be datasets used for these evaluations.

Next, I will focus on the **numerical experiments section (Section 4)**, as this section typically contains detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the experiments. I will look for any specific names or descriptions of datasets.

Upon reviewing Section 4, I find the following datasets mentioned:

1. **Synthetic Data**: The authors describe generating synthetic tensors for their experiments, but they do not provide a specific dataset name or citation for this synthetic data. Instead, they explain the methodology for generating this data.

2. **MNIST Dataset**: The authors mention using the MNIST dataset for image denoising and outlier detection. This dataset consists of handwritten digits and is widely used in machine learning research.

3. **VIRAT Dataset**: The authors also refer to the VIRAT dataset for background subtraction in video surveillance applications. This dataset contains videos for event recognition.

Now, I will gather the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

- For the **MNIST Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Chris Burges. *MNIST handwritten digit database*. ATT Labs [Online]. Available: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist, 2010.

- For the **VIRAT Dataset**, the citation is:
  > S. Oh, A. Hoogs, A. Perera, N. Cuntoor, C.-C. Chen, J. T. Lee, S. Mukherjee, J. Aggarwal, H. Lee, L. Davis, et al. *A large-scale benchmark dataset for event recognition in surveillance video*. In Proceedings of the 2011 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 3153â€“3160, 2011.

Since the synthetic data does not have a formal citation, I will note that it is generated for the purpose of the experiments without a specific reference.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for clarity and future reference. This will include the dataset names, descriptions, and citations where applicable.
