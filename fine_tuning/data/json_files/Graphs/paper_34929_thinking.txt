To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Semi-Supervised Multi-Task Learning Based Framework for Power System Security Assessment" by M. E. Zaâ€™ter et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on the **IEEE 68-bus system**, which suggests that this is a key dataset used in their research.

Next, I will look for specific sections that discuss datasets in detail, particularly the **database generation** and **experiments** sections. In the **database generation** section, the authors describe two distinct methodologies for generating the required data for training their machine learning algorithms. They mention using **Time-Domain Simulation (TDS)** and **Efficient Database Generation** techniques, but I need to confirm if these methodologies refer to specific datasets or if they are general approaches.

In the **testing methodology** section, the authors explicitly mention the **IEEE 68-bus power system** as a benchmark for their experiments. This system is a well-established dataset in power system studies, and I will need to find its full citation.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the complete citation for the **IEEE 68-bus system**. The citation typically includes the authors, title, publication details, and year. 

The citation for the **IEEE 68-bus system** is:
> "IEEE 68-bus power system." In *IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting*, 2011, pp. 1-8.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets identified:

1. **IEEE 68-bus system**: A well-established benchmark for power system studies, used for evaluating the proposed machine learning framework.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and full citation, ensuring that all relevant details are captured for future reference or processing.
