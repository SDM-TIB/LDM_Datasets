To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Probabilistic Ranking-Aware Ensembles for Enhanced Object Detections" by Mingyuan Mao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that experiments were conducted on the **PASCAL VOC** and **COCO2017** datasets, indicating that these are the primary datasets used in the research.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of these datasets in the **experiments section**. The authors state that they evaluated their PRAE method on both the **PASCAL VOC** and **COCO2017** datasets, confirming their use in the experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. **PASCAL VOC Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Mark Everingham, Luc Van Gool, Christopher K. I. Williams, John Winn, and Andrew Zisserman. *The PASCAL Visual Object Classes (VOC) Challenge*. In International Journal of Computer Vision, pages 303–338, 2015.

2. **COCO2017 Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, Serge J. Belongie, James Hays, Pietro Perona, Deva Ramanan, Piotr Dollár, and C. Lawrence Zitnick. *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. In European Conference on Computer Vision, pages 740–755, 2014.

Having identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research along with their proper citations.
