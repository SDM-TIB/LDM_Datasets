To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Planning for Proactive Assistance in Environments with Partial Observability" by Anagha Kulkarni et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and evaluation sections** to find any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research but may not explicitly mention datasets. The introduction often outlines the context and may reference prior works that used specific datasets.

Next, I will look for any **specific sections dedicated to datasets or experiments**. In this paper, the authors may describe the environments or scenarios used for empirical evaluation, which could include datasets or simulated environments.

I will pay close attention to any **figures, tables, or illustrations** that might indicate the use of datasets. For example, if the paper discusses user studies or empirical evaluations, it may reference datasets used for those studies.

If the paper mentions any datasets, I will then check the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For instance, if the paper refers to datasets like "USAR domain" or "Driverlog domain," I will look for the original sources or papers that describe these datasets in detail. I will ensure to capture the authors, title, publication venue, and year for each dataset.

Once I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset's name, description, and full citation.

Finally, I will ensure that the dataset entries are clear and concise, providing enough detail for someone else to understand the context and significance of each dataset in relation to the research presented in the paper.
