To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Optimizing transformations for contrastive learning in a differentiable framework" by Camille Ruppli et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that experiments were performed on **34,000 2D slices of brain Magnetic Resonance Images** and **11,200 chest X-ray images**, which suggests that these are the datasets used.

Next, I will look for more detailed descriptions in the **experiments section**. In this section, the authors clarify that the **BraTs MRI dataset** was used, which consists of 34,000 slices obtained from 3D volumes, and the **Chest X-ray dataset**, which contains 10,000 images. The authors also mention that they only kept slices with less than 80% black pixels for the BraTs dataset.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For the **BraTs MRI dataset**, the citation is:
  > Menze, B.H., et al. "The multimodal brain tumor image segmentation benchmark (BRATS)." *IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging*, 34(10), 1993â€“2024, 2015.

- For the **Chest X-ray dataset**, the citation is:
  > Tang, Y., et al. "Automated abnormality classification of chest radiographs using deep convolutional neural networks." *NPJ Digital Medicine*, 3, 2020.

With these citations, I can now summarize the datasets:

1. **BraTs MRI Dataset**: Contains 34,000 2D slices of brain MRI images, used for pathology presence classification.
2. **Chest X-ray Dataset**: Comprises 10,000 chest X-ray images, also used for pathology presence classification.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing. This methodical approach ensures that I accurately capture the datasets and their citations from the research paper.
