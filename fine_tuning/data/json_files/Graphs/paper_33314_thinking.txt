To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Adaptive Feature Selection for No-Reference Image Quality Assessment using Contrastive Mitigating Semantic Noise Sensitivity" by Xudong Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method on **eight standard NR-IQA datasets**, which suggests that specific datasets will be listed.

Next, I will look for a dedicated section that discusses the datasets in detail. In this case, **section 4.1 (Benchmark Datasets and Evaluation Protocols)** explicitly lists the datasets used for evaluation. The datasets mentioned are:

1. **LIVE Dataset**: A widely used dataset for image quality assessment, containing various distorted images.
2. **CSIQ Dataset**: Another standard dataset for assessing image quality, featuring images with different types of distortions.
3. **TID2013 Dataset**: A dataset that includes a variety of distorted images, specifically designed for image quality assessment.
4. **KADID Dataset**: A large-scale dataset containing artificially distorted images for quality assessment.
5. **LIVEC Dataset**: An authentic dataset comprising images captured by different photographers.
6. **KONIQ Dataset**: A dataset designed for deep learning applications in blind image quality assessment.
7. **LIVEFB Dataset**: The largest real-world dataset for image quality assessment, containing a significant number of images.
8. **SPAQ Dataset**: Another dataset used for assessing image quality, sourced from public multimedia resources.

In the **experiments section**, the authors confirm that they evaluate their method on these eight datasets, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:

With this information, I can now compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described along with its full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that all relevant datasets are captured and properly cited.
