To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Robust Task-Specific Beamforming with Low-Resolution ADCs for Power-Efficient Hybrid MIMO Receivers" by Eyyup Tasci et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and often mentions key datasets used for evaluation. 

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. This section is crucial as it usually contains detailed information about the datasets, including their names, sizes, and any specific characteristics that are relevant to the study.

In this paper, I will look for any mentions of datasets related to MIMO systems, ADCs, or any specific benchmarks that the authors might have used for their evaluations. If the authors refer to any datasets, I will take note of their names and descriptions.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is important as it provides the necessary context and allows others to locate the datasets for their own research.

For example, if the authors mention a dataset like "MIMO Channel Dataset" or "Hybrid MIMO Receiver Dataset," I will look for the corresponding citation in the references. If the dataset is publicly available, I will also note the URL or DOI if provided.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each entry is complete and accurately reflects the information presented in the paper.

Finally, I will summarize the findings in a structured format that clearly presents each dataset along with its citation, ready for further processing or review.
