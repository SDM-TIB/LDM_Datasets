To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Bootstrapping Your Own Positive Sample: Contrastive Learning With Electronic Health Record Data" by Tingyi Wanyan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on **real-world COVID-19 EHR data**, which indicates that a specific dataset is being used.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4.1) where the authors describe their dataset in detail. They mention that their dataset consists of **5,712 patients** who tested positive for COVID-19 and were hospitalized. This is a clear indication of the dataset being utilized for their experiments.

I will also look for any additional details provided about the dataset, such as the types of features included. The authors specify that the EHR data contains information on **COVID-19 status, demographics, laboratory test results, vital signs, and comorbidities**. This information is crucial for understanding the dataset's context and application.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. Since the dataset is derived from a real-world health system, it may not have a formal citation like traditional datasets. However, I will note that the dataset is based on **COVID-19 EHR data from a large, urban health system**.

Given that the dataset is not formally published as a standalone dataset, I will document it as follows:

- **COVID-19 EHR Dataset**: This dataset includes EHR data from **5,712 patients** who tested positive for COVID-19 and were hospitalized. It contains various features such as demographics, laboratory test results, vital signs, and comorbidities.

Since there is no formal citation for the dataset, I will note that it is based on data collected from a large health system, which is a common practice in healthcare research.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format that captures all the necessary details, ensuring that the information is clear and comprehensive for future reference or analysis.
