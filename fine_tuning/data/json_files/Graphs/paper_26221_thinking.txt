To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Tensor Oriented No-Reference Light Field Image Quality Assessment" by Wei Zhou, Likun Shi, and Zhibo Chen, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted extensive experiments on four publicly available LFI quality databases, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental results section** where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. They refer to four publicly available databases:

1. **Win5-LID Database**: This database contains 6 real scenes captured by Lytro Illum and 4 synthetic scenes, which cover various spatial perceptual information and colorfulness. It includes 220 distorted LFIs with 6 distortion types.

2. **MPI-LFA Database**: This database consists of 14 pristine LFIs captured by the TSC system, producing 336 distorted LFIs with 6 distortion types. It is designed to evaluate the quality of light field images.

3. **SMART Database**: Composed of 16 original LFIs and 256 distorted sequences obtained by introducing 4 compression distortions, this database is used for perceptual quality evaluation.

4. **VALID Database**: This database includes 5 reference LFIs and 40 distorted LFIs under 5 compression artifacts, with both 8-bit and 10-bit LFIs included.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
