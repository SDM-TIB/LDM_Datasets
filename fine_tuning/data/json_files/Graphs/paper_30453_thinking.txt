To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Indoor Smartphone SLAM with Learned Echoic Location Features" by Qun Song et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the system and its performance, but it may not specify datasets. The introduction often discusses related work and may reference datasets used in previous studies.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments and results sections**. These sections typically contain detailed information about the datasets used for evaluation. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

In this paper, the authors mention conducting extensive experiments in three environments: a living room, an office, and a shopping mall. I will check if they provide specific datasets or data collection methods for these environments.

I will also examine the **measurement study section** for any details on how data was collected, including the number of samples, types of measurements, and any specific datasets created for the experiments.

Once I identify the datasets, I will look at the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, if the authors refer to a dataset like "the Google Pixel 4 smartphone data," I will need to find the original source or publication that describes this dataset in detail.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation.

Finally, I will format the extracted information clearly and concisely, ready for further processing or review.
