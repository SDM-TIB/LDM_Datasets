To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Long Short View Feature Decomposition via Contrastive Video Representation Learning" by Nadine Behrmann et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of the proposed method on various downstream tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention the need for diverse features for tasks like action recognition and segmentation, hinting at the use of specific datasets for these tasks. I will look for any specific dataset names mentioned in this section.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly the parts where the authors describe their methodology and results. Here, they explicitly mention the datasets used for training and evaluation. I will look for sections that detail the datasets used for self-supervised learning and those used for downstream tasks.

From my reading, I find the following datasets mentioned:

1. **Kinetics-400**: This dataset is used for self-supervised learning. It consists of a large number of videos for action recognition tasks.
2. **UCF101**: This dataset is used for action recognition evaluation. It contains 101 action categories and is a widely used benchmark in the field.
3. **HMDB51**: Another dataset for action recognition, consisting of 51 action categories. It is also a standard benchmark for evaluating action recognition methods.
4. **Breakfast dataset**: This dataset is used for action segmentation tasks. It contains untrimmed videos with fine-grained action annotations.

Now, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **Kinetics-400**, the citation is:

- For **UCF101**, the citation is:

- For **HMDB51**, the citation is:

- For the **Breakfast dataset**, the citation is:
  > Colin Lea, Michael D. Flynn, Ren´e Vidal, Austin Reiter, and Gregory D. Hager. *Temporal convolutional networks for action segmentation and detection*. In CVPR, 2017.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations to ensure that I have a complete and accurate representation of the datasets used in the research paper.
