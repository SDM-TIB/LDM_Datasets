To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Cross-Modal Information-Guided Network using Contrastive Learning for Point Cloud Registration" by Yifan Xie et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions "extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets," which indicates that datasets are likely discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section IV (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, the authors explicitly mention three datasets:

1. **ModelNet40**: This dataset consists of 12,311 CAD models from 40 object categories, with 9,843 models used for training and 2,468 for testing.

2. **Stanford 3D Scan**: This dataset includes 10 actual scans, which were downsampled to 10,000 points for the experiments.

3. **7Scenes**: A widely used benchmark for registration in indoor environments, comprising 7 scenes (Chess, Fires, Heads, Office, Pumpkin, RedKitchen, and Stairs), divided into 296 training samples and 57 testing samples.

To ensure accuracy, I will also check the **References section** for full citations of these datasets:

- For **ModelNet40**, the citation is:
  > Wu, Z., Song, S., Khosla, A., Yu, F., Zhang, L., Tang, X., & Xiao, J. (2015). *3D ShapeNets: A Deep Representation for Volumetric Shapes*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pp. 1912–1920.

- For **Stanford 3D Scan**, the citation is:
  > Curless, B., & Levoy, M. (1996). *A Volumetric Method for Building Complex Models from Range Images*. In Proceedings of the 23rd Annual Conference on Computer Graphics and Interactive Techniques, pp. 303–312.

- For **7Scenes**, the citation is:
  > Shotton, J., Glocker, B., Zach, C., Izadi, S., Criminisi, A., & Fitzgibbon, A. (2013). *Scene Coordinate Regression Forests for Camera Relocalization in RGB-D Images*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pp. 2930–2937.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, which is essential for reproducibility and further research in the field.
