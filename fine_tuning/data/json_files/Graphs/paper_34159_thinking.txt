To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Knowledge-Based Convolutional Neural Network for the Simulation and Prediction of Two-Phase Darcy Flows" by Zakaria Elabid et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental analysis sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their model on a large-scale dataset for predicting pressure and saturation fields, which suggests that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental analysis section** where the authors provide specific details about the dataset used. In this section, they mention that they evaluate their KED approach on a dataset containing **2923 realizations of permeability K fields** corresponding to two facies: sand and mud. They describe the characteristics of the dataset, including the dimensions of the grid blocks and the parameters used for the simulation.

The authors also provide a reference to where the dataset can be accessed, which is crucial for citation purposes. They state that the data is publicly available at Stanford University, with a specific URL provided.

Now, I will compile the information about the dataset:

1. **Dataset Name**: Two-Phase Flow Dataset
   - **Description**: A dataset containing 2923 realizations of permeability K fields corresponding to two facies (sand and mud), with grid blocks of dimensions 40m x 40m x 20m.
   - **Access Information**: The dataset is publicly available at Stanford University.
   - **Citation**: 
     > "3D simulated data of two phase flow in a porous media," Stanford University, Accessed September 2023. [Online]. Available: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Zs9txwZIVKyQRwZL-D3O0R8Cl71tA-?usp=sharing

Finally, I will ensure that I have accurately captured the dataset's details and citation for future reference or processing. This structured approach allows me to extract and document the dataset effectively.
