To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Beyond the Model: Data Pre-processing Attack to Deep Learning Models in Android Apps" by Ye Sang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study and may mention any datasets used for empirical studies. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the research, which might include references to specific datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors mention conducting an empirical study on **517 real-world DL apps collected from Google Play**. This indicates that the dataset consists of mobile applications rather than traditional datasets like images or text.

I will also check the **results** and **discussion** sections for any additional details about the dataset, such as how it was collected, its characteristics, and any relevant statistics that might be useful for understanding the dataset's scope.

After identifying the dataset, I will refer to the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets or related works mentioned. In this case, since the dataset consists of mobile applications, I will look for any relevant papers or sources that describe the collection of these applications or similar datasets.

The citation for the paper itself is:
> Ye Sang, Yujin Huang, Shuo Huang, and Helei Cui. 2023. Beyond the Model: Data Pre-processing Attack to Deep Learning Models in Android Apps. In Secure and Trustworthy Deep Learning Systems (SecTL ’23), July 10–14, 2023, Melbourne, VIC, Australia. ACM, New York, NY, USA, 10 pages. https://doi.org/10.1145/3591197.3591308

Since the dataset is based on real-world applications rather than a traditional dataset, I will note that the dataset is derived from the Google Play Store and consists of applications that utilize deep learning models.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format that clearly describes the dataset, including its name, description, and citation. This will ensure that the dataset is properly documented for future reference or analysis.
