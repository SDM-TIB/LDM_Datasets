To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Data Acquisition and Preparation for Dual-reference Deep Learning of Image Super-Resolution" by Yanhui Guo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions a novel data acquisition process for generating low-resolution (LR) and high-resolution (HR) image pairs, which indicates that datasets are involved. The introduction further elaborates on the challenges of using synthetic datasets and hints at the need for real-world datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors describe their data collection process in detail, particularly in **Section III (DRTI Image Acquisition System)**. Here, they mention collecting three DRTI datasets, each containing 600 image triplets (Xi, Yi, Yi) from three different cameras.

I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **DRTI Dataset S1**: Collected using the Sony Nex-6 camera, containing 600 image triplets (Xi, Yi, Yi).
2. **DRTI Dataset S2**: Collected using the Canon 5D-MarkIII camera, also containing 600 image triplets (Xi, Yi, Yi).
3. **DRTI Dataset S3**: Collected using the Sony Alpha-a7RII camera, again containing 600 image triplets (Xi, Yi, Yi).

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. The authors reference several datasets in the context of their work, including:

- **DIV2K Dataset**: This dataset is mentioned as the source of the displayed images used for capturing the DRTI datasets. The citation is:
  > R. Timofte, E. Agustsson, L. Van Gool, M.-H. Yang, and L. Zhang. *NTIRE 2017 challenge on single image super-resolution: Methods and results*. In Proceedings of the IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition workshops, 2017, pp. 114â€“125.

- Other datasets referenced in the paper, such as those by Chen et al. and Cai et al., are also important to note, but since the focus is on the DRTI datasets, I will primarily document the DRTI datasets.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This structured approach will help ensure that I accurately capture all relevant information regarding the datasets used in the research paper.
