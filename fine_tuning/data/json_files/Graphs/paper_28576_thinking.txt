To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Delay-Oriented Distributed Scheduling Using Graph Neural Networks" by Zhongyuan Zhao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract discusses the proposed method and its evaluation but does not explicitly mention any datasets. The introduction provides context about wireless multi-hop networks and the challenges in scheduling, but again, no specific datasets are referenced.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, there is a **section 4 (Numerical Experiments)** that describes the simulated wireless networks used for evaluation. The authors mention various graph models used in their simulations, such as star graphs, Erdős–Rényi (ER) graphs, Barabási–Albert (BA) graphs, and power-law trees. However, these are not datasets in the traditional sense but rather models for simulation.

I will also check the **references section** to see if any datasets are cited indirectly through the references. The references include various papers that may have datasets related to wireless networks, but the paper itself does not provide specific datasets that were used for training or testing.

Since the paper primarily focuses on a simulation-based approach rather than using publicly available datasets, I will conclude that there are no explicit datasets to extract from this paper. 

However, I will note the relevant references that could potentially lead to datasets used in similar studies or methodologies:

1. **Erdős–Rényi (ER) Graphs**: 
   - Erdős, P., & Rényi, A. (1959). On random graphs I. *Publ. Math. Debrecen*, 6, 290–297.

2. **Barabási–Albert (BA) Graphs**: 
   - Albert, R., & Barabási, A.-L. (2002). Statistical mechanics of complex networks. *Rev. Mod. Phys.*, 74, 47–97.

3. **Power-Law Trees**: 
   - This concept is often discussed in the context of network theory, but specific citations may vary.

In summary, while the paper does not provide specific datasets, it references foundational works that describe the graph models used in their simulations. I will document these references as they may lead to datasets or methodologies relevant to the topic of the paper.
