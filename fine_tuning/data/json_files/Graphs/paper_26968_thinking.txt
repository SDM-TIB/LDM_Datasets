To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Pretext-Contrastive Learning: Toward Good Practices in Self-supervised Video Representation Learning" by Li Tao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the use of "two benchmark datasets," which indicates that datasets are indeed discussed.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they state that they primarily used the **UCF101** and **HMDB51** datasets for evaluation. 

1. **UCF101 Dataset**: The authors describe it as consisting of 13,320 videos across 101 action categories. This dataset is widely recognized in the action recognition community.

2. **HMDB51 Dataset**: This dataset is mentioned as containing 7,000 videos across 51 action classes. It is also a well-known benchmark for action recognition tasks.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **UCF101 dataset**, the citation is:
  > Soomro, K., Zamir, A. R., & Shah, M. (2012). *UCF101: A dataset of 101 human actions classes from videos in the wild*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1212.0402.

- For the **HMDB51 dataset**, the citation is:
  > Kuehne, H., Jhuang, H., Garrote, E., Poggio, T., & Serre, T. (2011). *HMDB: A large video database for human motion recognition*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pp. 2556â€“2563.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
