To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Disentangled Contrastive Collaborative Filtering" by Xubin Ren et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that experiments were conducted on various public datasets, which indicates that there are datasets to be identified. The introduction may provide further context about the datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology or experiments sections**. In this paper, there is a section labeled **4.1 (Experimental Settings)**, which includes a subsection titled **4.1.1 Datasets**. This is likely where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments.

In this section, the authors mention three datasets:

1. **Gowalla**: This dataset is collected from the Gowalla platform, which records check-in relations between users and different locations based on mobility traces. The statistics provided include the number of users, items, and interactions.

2. **Amazon-book**: This dataset includes rating behaviors of users over products in the book category on Amazon. Similar statistics are provided as for the Gowalla dataset.

3. **Tmall**: This dataset contains customer purchase behaviors from the online retailer Tmall, with corresponding statistics.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. However, it appears that the datasets are not attributed to specific papers in the references, as they are commonly used datasets in the recommendation systems community. Therefore, I will provide general citations for these datasets based on their common usage:

- For **Gowalla**, the citation is:
  > Gowalla Dataset. *Gowalla Check-in Data*. Available at: https://snap.stanford.edu/data/loc-gowalla.html.

- For **Amazon-book**, the citation is:
  > Amazon Product Review Dataset. *Amazon Book Reviews*. Available at: https://nijianmo.github.io/amazon/index.html.

- For **Tmall**, the citation is:
  > Tmall Dataset. *Tmall Purchase Data*. Available at: https://tianchi.aliyun.com/dataset/dataDetail?dataId=56.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and citations, ensuring that each dataset is properly documented for future reference.
