To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MaskCon: Masked Contrastive Learning for Coarse-Labelled Dataset" by Chen Feng and Ioannis Patras, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the proposed method achieves significant improvements over the state-of-the-art in various datasets, which indicates that multiple datasets are likely discussed.

In the **introduction**, the authors highlight the challenges of annotating large-scale datasets and the focus on learning from coarse-labeled datasets. This suggests that they may reference specific datasets used for their experiments.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors explicitly mention several datasets used for evaluation:

1. **CIFAR10**: A well-known dataset for image classification containing 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes.
2. **CIFAR100**: Similar to CIFAR10 but with 100 classes, each containing 600 images.
3. **ImageNet-1K**: A large-scale dataset containing over 1 million images across 1,000 classes, widely used for image classification tasks.
4. **Stanford Online Products**: A dataset consisting of 22,634 products with multiple images per product, used for image retrieval tasks.
5. **Stanford Cars196**: A fine-grained dataset containing 196 classes of cars, used for classification tasks.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to guide readers to the original sources.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

- **CIFAR10**:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
