To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Recurrent Graph Neural Network Algorithm for Unsupervised Network Community Detection" by Stanislav Sobolevsky, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. The introduction discusses the importance of community detection in various fields but does not specify any datasets either.

Next, I will examine the **methodology** and **experiments** sections, as these typically contain detailed information about the datasets used for evaluation. In the methodology section, the author describes the proposed GNN-inspired algorithm but does not mention specific datasets. However, in the **comparative evaluation** section, the author references several classic network examples used for benchmarking the proposed algorithm.

I will compile a list of the datasets mentioned in the comparative evaluation section, which includes:

1. **Zachary's Karate Network**: A well-known social network dataset representing friendships between members of a karate club.

2. **Dolphins' Social Network**: A dataset representing social interactions among dolphins.

11. **Blogs Network**: A dataset representing connections among political blogs.
    - Citation: Adamic, L. A., & Glance, N. (2005). "The political blogosphere: The battle for the hearts and minds of American voters." In *Proceedings of the 3rd international workshop on Link discovery* (pp. 36-43). ACM.

After identifying these datasets and their citations, I will ensure that I document them accurately for any further processing or analysis. This structured approach will help in extracting relevant datasets from similar research papers in the future.
