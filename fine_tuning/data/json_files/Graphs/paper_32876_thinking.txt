To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "DeepCrysTet: A Deep Learning Approach Using Tetrahedral Mesh for Predicting Properties of Crystalline Materials" by Hirofumi Tsuruta et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract states that the experimental results use the **Materials Project dataset**, which indicates that this dataset is crucial for the study.

Next, I will look into **section IV (Experiments)**, where the authors provide details about the dataset used. They mention that they used the **2018.10.18 version of the Materials Project dataset**, which contains crystal structures and various properties of 83,989 crystalline materials. This section also specifies the properties selected for evaluation, confirming the dataset's relevance.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Materials Project dataset. The relevant citation is:

- **Materials Project dataset**:
  > A. Jain, S. P. Ong, G. Hautier, W. Chen, W. D. Richards, S. Dacek, S. Cholia, D. Gunter, D. Skinner, G. Ceder et al., “Commentary: The Materials Project: A materials genome approach to accelerating materials innovation,” *APL Materials*, vol. 1, no. 1, p. 011002, 2013.

Since the paper primarily discusses the Materials Project dataset, I will focus on this dataset for extraction.

Now, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring that I include the full citation as required. This will be done in a structured format that can be used for further processing or review.
