To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CARTE: pretraining and transfer for tabular learning" by Myung Jun Kim et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention key datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experimental study)**, where the authors describe the datasets used in their experiments. This section typically contains detailed information about the datasets, including their sources, characteristics, and the specific tasks they are used for.

In **subsection 4.1 (Datasets)**, the authors state that they used **51 tabular learning datasets** for their experiments. They mention that these datasets cover a variety of topics, including accidents, elections, and food. I will look for a list or description of these datasets, as they are crucial for understanding the scope of the research.

The authors also reference specific datasets in the text, such as:
1. **Anime Planet**: Contains information about anime scraped from the website Anime-Planet, with the task of predicting average ratings.
2. **Beer Ratings**: Contains tasting profiles and consumer reviews for beers, with the task of predicting overall review ratings.

I will continue to extract the names and descriptions of all datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to note their associated tasks.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

For example, if the paper references a dataset like **YAGO**, I will look for its citation:
- **YAGO**: Mahdisoltani, F., Biega, J., & Suchanek, F. M. (2013). YAGO3: A knowledge base from multilingual wikipedias. In CIDR.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset information in a structured format for easy reference and potential downstream processing.
