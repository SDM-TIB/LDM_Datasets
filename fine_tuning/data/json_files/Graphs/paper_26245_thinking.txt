To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Graph Convolutions over Constituent Trees for Syntax-Aware Semantic Role Labeling" by Diego Marcheggiani and Ivan Titov, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method on standard English SRL benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors mention using resources like **PropBank** and **FrameNet** for semantic role labeling. This is a strong indication that these datasets are relevant to their work.

In the **experiments section**, specifically section 5.1, the authors explicitly state that they experiment on the **CoNLL-2005** and **CoNLL-2012** datasets, as well as **FrameNet 1.5**. They provide details about the datasets and their significance in the context of their research.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset from the **References section**:

1. **CoNLL-2005**:
   > Carreras, X., & M`arquez, L. (2005). Introduction to the CoNLL-2005 shared task: Semantic role labeling. In Proceedings of CoNLL (pp. 152–164).

2. **CoNLL-2012**:
   > Pradhan, S., Hacioglu, K., Ward, W. H., Martin, J. H., & Jurafsky, D. (2012). CoNLL-2012 shared task: Modeling multilingual unrestricted coreference in OntoNotes. In Proceedings of EMNLP-CoNLL (pp. 1–40).

3. **FrameNet 1.5**:
   > Baker, C. F., Fillmore, C. J., & Lowe, J. B. (1998). The Berkeley FrameNet Project. In Proceedings of COLING-ACL (pp. 86–90).

Having identified the datasets and their citations, I will summarize the information for each dataset, ensuring to include the full citation as required.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
