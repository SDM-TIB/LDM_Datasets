To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Joint User Association and Power Allocation in Heterogeneous Ultra Dense Network via Semi-Supervised Representation Learning" by Xiangyu Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or data sources.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments and results sections**. These sections typically contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used for evaluation. I will look for any specific datasets that the authors have utilized in their experiments, including any relevant characteristics such as the number of samples, types of data, and how the data was collected or generated.

In this paper, I will pay particular attention to any references to datasets in the context of the **simulation results** or **numerical results** sections, as these often summarize the datasets used for testing the proposed methods.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, if the authors mention using a dataset like the "3GPP model" for generating the radio map, I will look for the original source or paper that describes this model to provide a complete citation.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, including their names, descriptions, and citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset's details.

Finally, I will ensure that each dataset entry includes the full citation, as this is essential for academic integrity and for others who may wish to reference the same datasets in their work.
