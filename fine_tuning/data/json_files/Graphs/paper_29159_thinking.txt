To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Pruned Graph Neural Network for Short Story Ordering" by Melika Golestani et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions a "corpus of short stories," which suggests that a dataset is involved. I will look for specific names and descriptions of datasets in these sections.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of text coherence and sentence ordering, but I need to find explicit mentions of datasets. The **methodology section** is crucial, as it often contains detailed descriptions of the datasets used for experiments.

In **section 4.2 (Dataset)**, the authors specifically mention the dataset they used: **ROCStories**. They describe it as a corpus containing 98,162 commonsense stories, each with five sentences. This section provides valuable context about the dataset's characteristics, such as its utility for learning narrative structure and coherence.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the ROCStories dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Nasrin Mostafazadeh, Nathanael Chambers, Xiaodong He, Devi Parikh, Dhruv Batra, Lucy Vanderwende, Pushmeet Kohli, and James Allen. *A corpus and cloze evaluation for deeper understanding of commonsense stories*. In Proceedings of the 2016 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, pages 839â€“849, San Diego, California. Association for Computational Linguistics.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the findings:

1. **ROCStories**: A corpus of 98,162 commonsense stories, each with five sentences, useful for learning narrative structure and coherence.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for ROCStories, ensuring that the full citation is included for proper referencing. This structured approach ensures that I accurately capture the necessary details about the dataset used in the research paper.
