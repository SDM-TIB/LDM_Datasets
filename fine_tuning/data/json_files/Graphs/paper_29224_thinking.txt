To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Text Transformations in Contrastive Self-Supervised Learning: A Review" by Amrita Bhattacharjee et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections that discuss data augmentation and evaluation metrics**. The abstract provides a general overview of the paper's focus on contrastive self-supervised learning in NLP, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the body of the paper.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of self-supervised learning and contrastive learning but do not specify any datasets. I will then proceed to **section 3 (Data Augmentation)**, where the authors describe various transformation methods used in contrastive learning. Here, they reference several studies and their associated datasets indirectly through the methods they employ.

In **Table 1**, the authors summarize different types of transformations and the corresponding works that utilize them. This table includes references to specific papers that likely contain datasets used in their experiments. I will need to extract the relevant citations from this table.

Next, I will look at the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned in the context of the studies referenced in Table 1. The key studies that mention datasets include:

1. **GLUE**: The General Language Understanding Evaluation benchmark is referenced multiple times in the context of evaluating contrastive learning methods. The citation for GLUE is:
   > Wang, A., Singh, A., Michael, J., Hill, F., Levy, O., & Bowman, S. R. (2019). GLUE: A multi-task benchmark and analysis platform for natural language understanding. In ICLR.

2. **SICK-R**: The Sentences Involving Compositional Knowledge benchmark is also mentioned. The citation for SICK-R is:
   > Marelli, M., Menini, S., Baroni, M., Bentivogli, L., Bernardi, R., & Zamparelli, R. (2014). A sick cure for the evaluation of compositional distributional semantic models. In LREC.

3. **SNLI**: The Stanford Natural Language Inference dataset is referenced in the context of inference relations. The citation for SNLI is:
   > Bowman, S., Angeli, G., Potts, C., & Manning, C. D. (2015). A large annotated corpus for learning natural language inference. In EMNLP.

4. **SentEval**: The evaluation toolkit for sentence embeddings is mentioned as well. The citation for SentEval is:
   > Conneau, A., Kiela, D., Schwenk, H., & Bordes, A. (2018). Senteval: An evaluation toolkit for universal sentence representations. In arXiv.

After identifying these datasets and their citations, I will compile them into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset's name, description, and full citation. This will ensure that the information is organized and ready for further processing or review.
