To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Sample-Level Deep Convolutional Neural Networks for Music Auto-Tagging Using Raw Waveforms" by Jongpil Lee et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. In the abstract, the authors reference their experiments on the **Magnatagatune dataset** and the **Million Song Dataset**, indicating that these are the datasets used for their evaluations.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors provide specific details about the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention:

1. **Magnatagatune Dataset (MTAT)**: This dataset is used for music auto-tagging and is referenced with a citation. The authors note that they filtered out tags and used the most frequently labeled 50 tags.

2. **Million Song Dataset (MSD)**: This dataset is also used for music auto-tagging and is annotated with Last.FM tags. The authors mention that it is much larger than MTAT and provide details about the audio length and sampling rate.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Magnatagatune Dataset**, the citation is:
  > E. Law, K. West, M. I. Mandel, M. Bay, and J. S. Downie. *Evaluation of algorithms using games: The case of music tagging*. In ISMIR, 2009, pp. 387–392.

- For the **Million Song Dataset**, the citation is:
  > T. Bertin-Mahieux, D. P. Ellis, B. Whitman, and P. Lamere. *The million song dataset*. In Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Music Information Retrieval (ISMIR), vol. 2, no. 9, 2011, pp. 591–596.

Having gathered the necessary information, I will now prepare to create structured entries for each dataset, ensuring that I include the full citations as required. This will allow for proper referencing and acknowledgment of the datasets used in the research.
