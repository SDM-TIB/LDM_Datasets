To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Dissecting FLOPs along input dimensions for GreenAI cost estimations" by Andrea Asperti, Davide Evangelista, and Moreno Marzolla, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a general overview, but I need to look for specific mentions of datasets used in experiments or analyses.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the ecological impact of AI and the need for efficient metrics, but they do not explicitly mention any datasets. I will continue to the **experiments section** to find more concrete information.

In **section 6 (Additional experimental results)**, the authors state that "data providing the base for this paper are available on Github (https://github.com/asperti/alpha_flops_dataset)," which indicates that there is a dataset related to their experiments. However, they do not provide a detailed description of the dataset within the text.

Next, I will check the **References section** to see if any datasets are cited or if there are any papers that describe datasets used in their experiments. The references primarily focus on related works and methodologies rather than specific datasets.

Since the authors mention that the dataset is available on GitHub, I will note that the dataset can be accessed online, but I will also need to provide the citation for the paper itself as it is the source of the dataset.

The citation for the paper is:
> Andrea Asperti, Davide Evangelista, and Moreno Marzolla. *Dissecting FLOPs along input dimensions for GreenAI cost estimations*. In Proceedings of the Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS), 2023.

Now, I will compile the information I have gathered about the dataset into a structured format, ensuring to include the citation for the dataset as it is crucial for proper attribution. The dataset is hosted on GitHub, which I will also include in the description.

After completing these steps, I will have a clear entry for the dataset that can be used for further processing or review.
