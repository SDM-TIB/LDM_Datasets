To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Co-GRU Enhanced End-to-End Design for Long-haul Coherent Transmission Systems" by Jiayu Zheng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to look for any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and it may mention specific datasets or benchmarks used in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section IV) to find detailed descriptions of the datasets used for training and testing the models. This section typically contains information about the datasets, including their characteristics, sizes, and any specific configurations used during the experiments.

I will also check the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned in the paper. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

In the paper, the authors discuss the use of a **5-channel WDM system** and mention the **SSFM channel model** as part of their methodology. However, they do not explicitly name any publicly available datasets. Instead, they describe the simulation setup and the parameters used for their experiments, such as the modulation format (32Gbaud 64-QAM) and the transmission distance (960 km).

Since there are no specific datasets mentioned in the paper, I will note that the authors primarily rely on simulations rather than external datasets. However, I will still document the relevant simulation parameters and configurations as they are essential for replicating the experiments.

Finally, I will compile the findings into a structured format, ensuring that any references to datasets or simulation setups are clearly documented, along with their citations if applicable. If no datasets are explicitly mentioned, I will indicate that the work is based on simulations rather than external datasets.
