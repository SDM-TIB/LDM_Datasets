To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CKTGNN: Circuit Graph Neural Network for Electronic Design Automation" by Zehao Dong et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract states that the authors introduce the **Open Circuit Benchmark (OCB)**, which is an open-sourced dataset containing 10,000 distinct operational amplifiers with circuit specifications. This indicates that a dataset is present.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** to gather more details about the dataset. The authors describe the OCB dataset in detail, mentioning that it includes operational amplifiers and their specifications, such as DC gain, bandwidth, and phase margin. This section confirms that OCB is the primary dataset used for their experiments.

In the **Open Circuit Benchmark section**, the authors provide further insights into the dataset's structure and purpose. They explain that OCB is designed to facilitate research in electronic design automation by providing a standardized set of operational amplifiers, which can be used for various experiments and evaluations.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Open Circuit Benchmark dataset. The authors do not provide a separate citation for OCB, but they mention that the dataset is available on GitHub, which I will note as part of the dataset documentation.

The relevant details I have gathered about the dataset are as follows:

1. **Open Circuit Benchmark (OCB)**: This dataset contains 10,000 operational amplifiers with carefully extracted circuit specifications. It is designed to support research in electronic design automation.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring to include the dataset name, description, and the source where it can be accessed.

The final output will include:
- Dataset Name: Open Circuit Benchmark (OCB)
- Description: An open-sourced dataset containing 10,000 distinct operational amplifiers with circuit specifications, designed for electronic design automation research.
- Citation: Available at [GitHub repository](https://github.com/zehao-dong/CktGNN).

This structured information will be ready for further processing or review.
