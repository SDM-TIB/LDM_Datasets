To extract datasets from the research paper titled "FlexER: Flexible Entity Resolution for Multiple Intents" by Bar Genossar et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions a "new benchmark" and two well-known benchmarks, which indicates that there are datasets involved. I will look for specific names of these datasets.

Next, I will carefully read through the **experiments** section, particularly **Section 5 (Empirical Evaluation)**, where the authors discuss the datasets used for their evaluation. Here, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their characteristics and the context in which they are used.

In **Table 3**, the authors provide a summary of the benchmark datasets used in their evaluation, which includes:

1. **AmazonMI**: A new benchmark dataset consisting of 3,835 products extracted from Amazon, with 15,404 pairs and 5 intents.
2. **Walmart-Amazon**: A dataset with 24,628 records and 10,242 pairs, containing 4 intents.
3. **WDC**: A dataset with 10,935 records and 30,673 pairs, containing 2 intents.

I will also check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. The authors mention that the AmazonMI dataset is based on Amazon product data, and they provide links to their GitHub repository for the dataset. 

For the **Walmart-Amazon** dataset, the authors refer to a previous work that published pre-defined candidate pair sets, which I will need to cite accordingly. The **WDC** dataset is also mentioned as being used in previous research, and I will look for its citation as well.

Now, I will compile the full citations for each dataset:

After gathering this information, I will ensure that I format the dataset entries correctly and prepare them for inclusion in the required output format.
