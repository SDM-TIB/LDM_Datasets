To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Supervised Contrastive Learning with Hard Negative Samples" by Ruijie Jiang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and it may mention specific datasets used for experiments. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets in relation to the study.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, which typically contains detailed information about the datasets used for evaluation. In this paper, the authors mention conducting experiments on several datasets, which is a strong indication that specific datasets will be listed.

I will look for a section that explicitly discusses the datasets, which may be labeled as "Datasets" or something similar. In this case, the authors mention using the following datasets:

1. **STL10**: A dataset containing 10 classes with 5,000 labeled images and 100,000 unlabeled images.
2. **CIFAR10**: A well-known dataset with 10 classes, each containing 6,000 images.
3. **CIFAR100**: Similar to CIFAR10 but with 100 classes, each containing 600 images.
4. **TinyImageNet**: A dataset with 200 classes, each containing 500 training images and 50 validation images.
5. **MUTAG**: A graph dataset used for molecular classification.
6. **ENZYMES**: A dataset for enzyme classification.
7. **PTC**: A dataset for predicting chemical compounds.
8. **IMDB-BINARY**: A dataset for binary classification of movie reviews.
9. **IMDB-MULTI**: A dataset for multi-class classification of movie reviews.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper for full citations. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access the datasets. The citations for the datasets mentioned in the paper are as follows:

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, along with the necessary references for further exploration.
