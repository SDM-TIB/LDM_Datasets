To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Combining Graph Neural Network and Mamba to Capture Local and Global Tissue Spatial Relationships in Whole Slide Images" by Ruiwen Ding et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract states that the model was demonstrated using patients from two publicly available datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will look into the **Methods** section, specifically under the **Experiments and Results** subsection, where the authors discuss the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention two datasets:

1. **National Lung Screening Trial (NLST)**: This dataset consists of 132 patients with early-stage lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) who had surgical resection. The inclusion criteria are specified, and the dataset is used to evaluate the model's performance.

2. **Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)**: This dataset includes 312 patients with similar criteria as the NLST dataset. It is also used for model evaluation.

I will then confirm the details of these datasets by checking the **References section** for their full citations. The citations for these datasets are as follows:

- For the **National Lung Screening Trial (NLST)**, the citation is:
  > National Lung Screening Trial Research Team. "Reduced Lung-Cancer Mortality with Low-Dose Computed Tomographic Screening." *New England Journal of Medicine*, vol. 365, no. 5, pp. 395-409, 2011.

- For the **Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)**, the citation is:
  > Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network. "Comprehensive Molecular Characterization of Lung Adenocarcinoma." *Nature*, vol. 511, no. 7511, pp. 543-550, 2014.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described accurately and that the full citations are included. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
