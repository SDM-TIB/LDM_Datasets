To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Universal and Flexible Optical Aberration Correction Using Deep-Prior Based Deconvolution" by Xiu Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of a PSF-aware deep network and references the need for high-quality imaging, which suggests that datasets related to image quality and optical aberration might be involved.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **methodology** and **experiments** sections. In the **method** section, the authors describe their training process and mention using the **DIV2K** and **Flicker2K** datasets for training their model. This is a crucial finding, as it indicates the datasets used for their experiments.

In the **results** section, the authors discuss the performance of their model using these datasets, which further confirms their relevance. I will also check the **references** section to find the full citations for these datasets.

Now, I will gather the necessary details for each dataset:

1. **DIV2K Dataset**: This dataset is commonly used for image super-resolution tasks and contains 2,000 high-resolution images. The citation for this dataset is:
   > E. Agustsson and R. Timofte. *Ntire 2017 challenge on single image super-resolution: Dataset and study*. In CVPRW, 2017.

2. **Flicker2K Dataset**: This dataset is used for training deep learning models for image restoration and contains 2,000 high-resolution images sourced from Flickr. The citation for this dataset is:
   > J. H. R. Chang, C. Li, B. Póczo, B. V. K. Vijaya Kumar, and A. C. Sankaranarayanan. *One network to solve them all — solving linear inverse problems using deep projection models*. In ICCV, 2017.

After identifying these datasets and their citations, I will compile the information into a structured format that highlights each dataset's name, description, and citation. This will ensure that I have a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, along with their proper citations for future reference.
