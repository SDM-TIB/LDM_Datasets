To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Neural Networks with Quantization Constraints" by Ignacio Hounie, Juan Elenter, and Alejandro Ribeiro, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions the application of the proposed method in image classification tasks, which suggests that datasets may be involved. I will look for any specific dataset names or references in these sections.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (section 4) closely, as this is typically where authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and any relevant details about their use in the experiments.

In this paper, the authors mention using the **CIFAR-10 dataset** for their experiments. I will note down the details provided about this dataset, including its characteristics and how it was utilized in the context of their research.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. For the CIFAR-10 dataset, I will look for the original source or any relevant papers that describe it comprehensively.

The citation for the CIFAR-10 dataset is:
> Alex Krizhevsky, “Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images,” Tech. Rep., Canadian Institute for Advanced Research, 2009.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines the dataset's name, description, and citation.

Finally, I will ensure that all extracted information is accurate and ready for any further processing or review.
