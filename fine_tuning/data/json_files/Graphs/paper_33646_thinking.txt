To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Morality is Non-Binary: Building a Pluralist Moral Sentence Embedding Space using Contrastive Learning" by Jeongwoo Park et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and background sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract discusses the Moral Foundations Twitter Corpus (MFTC), which is a significant dataset used in the research. This is a good starting point.

Next, I will focus on the **Background and Data section**, where the authors provide detailed information about the MFTC. They describe it as a collection of 35,108 tweets annotated with moral sentiment based on the Moral Foundations Theory (MFT). This section confirms that the MFTC is a primary dataset used in their experiments.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the MFTC. The citation provided in the paper is:
> Hoover, J., Portillo-Wightman, G., Yeh, L., et al. (2020). *Moral foundations twitter corpus: A collection of 35k tweets annotated for moral sentiment*. Social Psychological and Personality Science, 11, 1057–1071.

Additionally, I will look for any other datasets mentioned in the paper. In the **Related Works section**, the authors mention other datasets based on different moral value taxonomies, but they primarily focus on the MFTC for their experiments. 

After reviewing the entire paper, I will compile the dataset information. The only dataset explicitly mentioned and used in the experiments is the MFTC. 

Now, I will summarize the findings:

1. **Moral Foundations Twitter Corpus (MFTC)**: This dataset consists of 35,108 tweets collected from various domains and annotated with moral sentiment based on the MFT.

The full citation for the MFTC is:
> Hoover, J., Portillo-Wightman, G., Yeh, L., et al. (2020). *Moral foundations twitter corpus: A collection of 35k tweets annotated for moral sentiment*. Social Psychological and Personality Science, 11, 1057–1071.

With this information, I can now prepare the dataset entry for further processing or review.
