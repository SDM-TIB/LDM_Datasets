To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Spectral Network Embedding: A Fast and Scalable Method via Sparsity" by Jie Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the proposed method, Progle, is validated on **four different datasets**, which indicates that there are specific datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors provide details about the datasets used for node classification experiments. Here, they list four datasets:

1. **BlogCatalog**: A social blogger network with 10,312 nodes and 333,983 edges, containing 39 labels.
2. **Wikipedia**: A co-occurrence network of words from the first million bytes of the Wikipedia dump, with 4,777 nodes and 184,812 edges, containing 40 labels.
3. **Protein-Protein Interactions (PPI)**: A subgraph of the PPI network for Homo Sapiens, consisting of 3,890 nodes and 76,584 edges, with 50 labels.
4. **DBLP**: An academic network dataset with 51,264 nodes and 127,968 edges, containing 60 labels.

In the same section, the authors also mention three additional unlabeled datasets used for efficiency and scalability validation, which are:

1. **Flickr**: A user contact network with 80,513 nodes and 5,899,882 edges.
2. **Youtube**: A friendship network of Youtube users with 1,134,890 nodes and 2,987,624 edges.
3. **wiki-topcats**: A web graph of Wikipedia hyperlinks collected in September 2011, with 1,791,489 nodes and 25,447,873 edges.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **BlogCatalog**, the citation is:
  > Zafarani, R., & Liu, H. (2009). Social computing data repository at ASU. 

- For **Wikipedia**, the citation is:

- For **Flickr**, the citation is:
  > Zafarani, R., & Liu, H. (2009). Social computing data repository at ASU.

- For **Youtube**, the citation is:
  > Leskovec, J., & Sosič, R. (2016). Snap: A general-purpose network analysis and graph-mining library. ACM Transactions on Intelligent Systems and Technology (TIST), 8(1), 1.

- For **wiki-topcats**, the citation is:
  > Leskovec, J., & Sosič, R. (2016). Snap: A general-purpose network analysis and graph-mining library. ACM Transactions on Intelligent Systems and Technology (TIST), 8(1), 1.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that I have accurately represented the datasets used in the research.
