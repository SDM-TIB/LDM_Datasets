To extract datasets from the research paper titled "NOISE-BERT: A Unified Perturbation-Robust Framework with Noise Alignment Pre-training for Noisy Slot Filling Task" by Jinxu Zhao et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the challenges of input perturbations in slot filling, but it does not specify any datasets. Therefore, I will look for explicit mentions in the introduction.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the slot filling task and its importance in task-oriented dialogue systems, but they do not name any datasets yet. I will continue to the **methodology** section, where they describe their approach and any data augmentation techniques used.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**. Here, the authors mention using two datasets: **RADDLE** and **SNIPS**. They describe RADDLE as a crowd-sourced diagnostic evaluation dataset that covers a range of real-world noisy texts for dialogue systems. SNIPS is mentioned as a dataset used for introducing mixed perturbations.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. **RADDLE**: The citation is:
   > Baolin Peng, Chunyuan Li, Zhu Zhang, Chenguang Zhu, Jinchao Li, and Jianfeng Gao. *Raddle: An evaluation benchmark and analysis platform for robust task-oriented dialog systems*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2012.14666, 2020.

2. **SNIPS**: The citation is:
   > Alice Coucke, Alaa Saade, Adrien Ball, Théodore Bluche, Alexandre Caulier, David Leroy, Clément Doumouro, Thibault Gisselbrecht, Francesco Caltagirone, Thibaut Lavril, Maël Primet, and Joseph Dureau. *Snips voice platform: an embedded spoken language understanding system for private-by-design voice interfaces*. 2018.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

- **RADDLE**: A crowd-sourced diagnostic evaluation dataset covering a broad range of real-world noisy texts for dialogue systems.
- **SNIPS**: A dataset used for spoken language understanding, particularly in private voice interfaces.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing.
