To extract datasets from the research paper titled "PDT: Pretrained Dual Transformers for Time-aware Bipartite Graphs" by Xin Dai et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that the proposed method is evaluated on two large datasets, which indicates that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they mention:

1. **MovieLens-25M**: This dataset consists of 25,000,095 reviews made by 162,541 reviewers on 59,047 movies. The authors describe their preprocessing steps, which include grouping reviews by reviewers and sorting them by timestamp.

2. **Amazon Review Dataset**: This dataset contains 192,464,864 reviews made by 47,249,276 reviewers on 14,894,121 products. The authors also describe how they split this dataset into training, validation, and test sets based on timestamps.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **MovieLens-25M**, the citation is:
  > F. Maxwell Harper and Joseph A. Konstan. *The MovieLens Datasets: History and Context*. ACM Transactions on Interactive Intelligent Systems, 5(4):19, 2015.

- For **Amazon Review Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Julian McAuley and Jure Leskovec. *Hidden Factors and Hidden Topics: Understanding Rating Dimensions with Review Text*. In Proceedings of the 7th ACM Conference on Recommender Systems, pages 165â€“172, 2013.

With this information, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **MovieLens-25M**: A large dataset of movie reviews used for recommendation tasks.
2. **Amazon Review Dataset**: A comprehensive dataset of product reviews utilized for evaluating recommendation systems.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all information is accurately represented for future reference or processing.
