To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-stage Retrieve and Re-rank Model for Automatic Medical Coding Recommendation" by Xindi Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract highlights the use of the **MIMIC-III benchmark**, which suggests that this dataset is central to the research.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors discuss the datasets used for their experiments. In **section 4.1 (Dataset and Pre-processing)**, the authors provide a detailed description of the **MIMIC-III dataset**. They mention that it contains various patient data types, including discharge summaries, demographic details, interventions, laboratory results, and medication information. They specify that the dataset includes 52,722 discharge summaries and 8,922 unique ICD-9 codes.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the MIMIC-III dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Alistair E. W. Johnson, Tom J. Pollard, Lu Shen, Li wei H. Lehman, Mengling Feng, Moham- mad Mahdi Ghassemi, Benjamin Moody, Peter Szolovits, Leo Anthony Celi, and Roger G. Mark. *MIMIC-III, a freely accessible critical care database*. Scientific Data, 3.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the dataset. The dataset entry will include the name, description, and citation.

After completing this process, I will have a clear and concise entry for the dataset used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
