To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Graph Attention Multi-Agent Fleet Autonomy for Advanced Air Mobility" by Malintha Fernando et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of a novel heterogeneous graph attention encoder-decoder neural network for coordinating a fleet of aerial vehicles, but it does not specify any datasets at this point.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** in detail, as this is where datasets are typically described. I will look for any references to datasets used for training or evaluation purposes. If the authors mention specific datasets, I will note their names and any relevant details provided, such as the number of samples, types of data, and the context in which they were used.

In this paper, the authors do not explicitly mention any datasets in the experiments section. However, they refer to a custom AAM environment and various parameters for simulating payload requests, which suggests that they may have created their own dataset for the experiments. I will need to clarify this by checking the **appendices or supplementary materials** if available, as they often contain additional details about datasets or experimental setups.

If I find any datasets mentioned, I will then look for the **References section** to find full citations for those datasets. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

If no external datasets are referenced, I will note that the authors created a custom dataset for their experiments, and I will summarize the key characteristics of this dataset based on the information provided in the paper.

Finally, I will compile the findings into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described with its full citation, if applicable. This will include any custom datasets created by the authors, along with a brief description of their purpose and characteristics.

In summary, my steps will be:
1. Read the abstract, introduction, and methodology sections for mentions of datasets.
2. Focus on the experiments section for explicit dataset descriptions.
3. Check appendices or supplementary materials for additional dataset information.
4. Look for full citations in the References section for any mentioned datasets.
5. Compile the findings into a structured summary with full citations.
