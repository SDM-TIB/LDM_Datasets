To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Letâ€™s be friends! A rapport-building 3D embodied conversational agent for the Human Support Robot" by Katarzyna Pasternak et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, but it may not contain specific dataset names. The introduction may provide context and mention any datasets used in prior research, which could be relevant.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly the **pilot study experiment** and **discussion** sections, as these are likely to detail the datasets used for the experiments. In this paper, the authors describe a pilot study involving three participants, but they do not explicitly mention any external datasets. Instead, they discuss the setup and the technology used (e.g., EmoPy and DLib) without referencing any specific datasets.

Since the paper does not provide any datasets, I will check the **references section** to see if any datasets are cited in the context of the tools or methods used. The references may include datasets indirectly related to the study, such as those used for emotion detection or facial expression analysis.

Upon reviewing the references, I find that the paper cites EmoPy, a machine learning toolkit for emotional expression, but it does not provide a specific dataset associated with it. The references also include various studies and tools related to human-robot interaction, but again, no specific datasets are mentioned.

Since there are no datasets explicitly mentioned in the paper, I will conclude that this research does not utilize any publicly available datasets that can be cited. Therefore, I will not create any dataset entries for this paper.

In summary, my process involved:
1. Reading the abstract and introduction for context.
2. Analyzing the methods and pilot study sections for any dataset mentions.
3. Checking the references for any related datasets.
4. Concluding that no datasets were explicitly mentioned or used in the research.

This approach ensures that I thoroughly investigate the paper for any potential datasets while adhering to the importance of providing full citations when applicable.
