To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Object-aware Contrastive Learning for Debiased Scene Representation" by Sangwoo Mo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the development of a novel object-aware contrastive learning framework, which suggests that datasets are likely involved in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this paper, the authors mention several datasets in the context of their experiments:

1. **COCO Dataset**: This dataset is referenced multiple times, particularly in relation to the performance of their method under multi-object images. It is a well-known dataset for object detection and segmentation tasks.

2. **Flowers Dataset**: This dataset is used for evaluating the effectiveness of their method in reducing biases during contrastive learning.

3. **CUB Dataset**: The Caltech-UCSD Birds-200-2011 dataset is mentioned as another dataset used for evaluation, particularly in the context of object localization.

4. **ImageNet-9 Dataset**: This dataset is referenced in the context of evaluating generalization performance on distribution-shifted datasets.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **COCO Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Lin, T.-Y., Maire, M., Belongie, S., Hays, J., Perona, P., Ramanan, D., DollÃ¡r, P., & Zitnick, C. L. (2014). Microsoft COCO: Common objects in context. In European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV).

- For the **Flowers Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Nilsback, M.-E., & Zisserman, A. (2006). A visual vocabulary for flower classification. In IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR).

- For the **CUB Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Wah, C., Branson, S., Welinder, P., Perona, P., & Belongie, S. (2011). The Caltech-UCSD Birds-200-2011 Dataset. Technical Report CNS-TR-2011-001, California Institute of Technology.

- For the **ImageNet-9 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Xiao, K., Engstrom, L., Ilyas, A., & Madry, A. (2021). Noise or signal: The role of image backgrounds in object recognition. In International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR).

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations.
