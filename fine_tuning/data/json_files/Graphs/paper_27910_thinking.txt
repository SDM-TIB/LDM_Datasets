To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Neighborhood Contrastive Learning for Novel Class Discovery" by Zhun Zhong et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and method sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on three datasets commonly used in Novel Class Discovery (NCD): CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet. This is a strong indication that these datasets will be discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Dataset and Experimental Details)**, where the authors provide specific information about the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention:

1. **CIFAR-10**: This dataset contains 50,000 training images from 10 classes, with the first five classes used as labeled data and the remaining five as unlabeled data.

2. **CIFAR-100**: Similar to CIFAR-10, this dataset also contains 50,000 training images but spans 100 classes. The authors use the first 80 classes as labeled data and the remaining 20 as unlabeled data.

3. **ImageNet**: A large-scale dataset with 1.28 million training images from 1,000 classes. The authors split the training data into two parts, using images from 882 classes as labeled data and images from 118 classes as unlabeled data.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **CIFAR-10** and **CIFAR-100**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton, et al. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. University of Toronto, 2009.

- For **ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, and Li Fei-Fei. *Imagenet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2009.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
