To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Generalizing Conversational Dense Retrieval via LLM-Cognition Data Augmentation" by Haonan Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions "extensive experiments conducted on four public datasets," which indicates that there are specific datasets used in the research.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors typically provide detailed information about the datasets used. In this section, they mention that they conducted experiments on **QReCC**, **TopiOCQA**, **CAsT-20**, and **CAsT-21**. I will note down the details provided for each dataset, including their purpose and any relevant statistics.

1. **QReCC**: This dataset is described as a large-scale, open-domain conversational question-answering dataset featuring human-annotated question rewrites. It integrates conversations from QuAC, TREC CAsT, and Natural Questions, with a text corpus containing 54 million passages.

2. **TopiOCQA**: This dataset comprises conversations derived from real search queries found in Natural Questions, with subsequent interactions simulated using a wizard-of-oz approach. It contains 3,509 training conversations and 205 testing conversations.

3. **CAsT-20**: Released by the TREC Conversational Assistance Track, this dataset includes 25 conversations and 208 turns, with a corresponding human rewrite for each query turn.

4. **CAsT-21**: Similar to CAsT-20, this dataset includes 18 conversations and 157 turns, also with human rewrites.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and further exploration of the datasets.

- For **QReCC**, the citation is:

- For **TopiOCQA**, the citation is:

- For **CAsT-20**, the citation is:

- For **CAsT-21**, the citation is:

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or analysis.
