To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Federated Learning-Based Risk-Aware Decision to Mitigate Fake Task Impacts on Crowdsensing Platforms" by Zhiyan Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and while it may not explicitly mention datasets, it sets the context for the experiments conducted.

Next, I will focus on **section III (System Overview)**, where the authors describe their proposed framework. Here, they mention that each detection device operates with a local dataset. I will look for specific names or descriptions of these datasets.

In **section IV (Performance Evaluation)**, the authors discuss the experiments conducted and mention the use of a dataset generated by the CrowdSenSim tool. They specify that this dataset consists of 1,000 MCS tasks, with a distribution of 89% legitimate tasks and 11% fake tasks. This section is crucial as it provides details about the dataset used for their experiments.

I will also check the **References section** to find any citations related to the datasets mentioned. The authors refer to their prior work, which is essential for providing full citations.

The relevant dataset extracted from the paper is:

1. **CrowdSenSim Dataset**: This dataset is generated using real physical features and consists of 1,000 MCS tasks, with a distribution of 89% legitimate tasks and 11% fake tasks. The dataset is used to evaluate the performance of the proposed federated learning framework.

Now, I will look for the full citation for the CrowdSenSim dataset. The authors reference the following paper for the CrowdSenSim tool:

- For **CrowdSenSim**, the citation is:
  > C. Fiandrino et al. *CrowdSenSim: a simulation platform for mobile crowdsensing in urban environments*. IEEE Access, 5:3490â€“3503, 2017.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry with the full citation, ensuring that it is ready for any structured output or further processing.
