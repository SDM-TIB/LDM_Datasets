To extract datasets from the research paper titled "LMR: A Large-Scale Multi-Reference Dataset for Reference-based Super-Resolution" by Lin Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors constructed a dataset named **LMR**, which is a large-scale multi-reference super-resolution dataset. This is a clear indication that I need to gather more details about this dataset.

Next, I will look into **section 3 (Approach)**, specifically **subsection 3.1 (Construction of LMR)**, where the authors describe the dataset in detail. Here, they mention that the LMR dataset consists of **112,142 groups of 300×300 training images**, each containing **5 reference images** with varying similarity levels. This section provides crucial information about the dataset's structure and size.

Additionally, I will check **section 4.1 (Datasets and Metrics)**, where the authors mention that they trained their network on the proposed LMR training set and evaluated it on several testing sets, including **CUFED5**. This confirms that LMR is the primary dataset used in their experiments.

Now, I will gather the full citation for the LMR dataset from the **References section**. Since the LMR dataset is introduced in this paper, I will cite it as follows:

- For **LMR Dataset**:
  > Lin Zhang, Xin Li, Dongliang He, Fu Li, Errui Ding, Zhaoxiang Zhang. *LMR: A Large-Scale Multi-Reference Dataset for Reference-based Super-Resolution*. In Proceedings of the European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), 2022.

Furthermore, I will also note the **CUFED5 dataset** mentioned in the paper, as it is relevant to their research. The citation for CUFED5 is:

- For **CUFED5 Dataset**:
  > Zhifei Zhang, Zhaowen Wang, Zhe Lin, Hairong Qi. *Image super-resolution by neural texture transfer*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 7982–7991, 2019.

After compiling this information, I will summarize the datasets extracted from the paper, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research.
