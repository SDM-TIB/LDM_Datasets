To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Spatial Relation Graph and Graph Convolutional Network for Object Goal Navigation" by D. A. Sasi Kiran et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the framework is evaluated using the **Matterport3D benchmark dataset**, which is a clear indication that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will look for specific sections that discuss datasets in detail. In this case, I will focus on the **experimental setup** and **results** sections, as these typically provide insights into the datasets used for evaluation and comparison.

In the **experimental setup** section, the authors mention that the framework is trained on trajectories taken from 51 scenes and tested on 250 episodes across five scenes from the **Matterport3D (MP3D) dataset**. This confirms that the MP3D dataset is the primary dataset used in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Matterport3D dataset. The citation provided in the references is:

> A. Chang, A. Dai, T. Funkhouser, M. Halber, M. Niessner, M. Savva, S. Song, A. Zeng, and Y. Zhang. *Matterport3D: Learning from RGB-D data in indoor environments*. IEEE 3DV, 2017.

Since the paper primarily discusses the Matterport3D dataset, I will create an entry for this dataset.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry with the full citation into a structured format that is ready for review or further processing. This ensures that I have accurately captured the necessary information regarding the dataset used in the research.
