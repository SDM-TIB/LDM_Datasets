To extract datasets from the research paper titled "3D PET/CT Tumor Lesion Segmentation Based on nnUNet with GCN Refinement" by Hengzhi Xue et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors performed tumor segmentation experiments on the **PET/CT dataset in the MICCIA2022 autoPET challenge**, which indicates that this dataset is significant for their research.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for further details about the datasets. The introduction references the importance of PET/CT scans for tumor diagnosis and mentions various studies but does not introduce new datasets.

Moving on to **section 3.1.1 (Data)**, the authors provide specific details about the dataset used in their experiments. They mention that they utilized PET/CT data from the **MICCIA2022 autoPET challenge**, which contains 1014 sets of training data from 900 patients at University Hospital Tubingen, Germany. They also specify that they randomly selected 220 scans with tumors for training and validation, and 30 scans for testing.

To ensure I have the correct citation for the dataset, I will check the **References section**. The relevant citation for the MICCIA2022 autoPET challenge dataset is:

- **MICCIA2022 autoPET challenge**: 
  > Gatidis, S., Hepp, T., Früh, M., La Fougère, C., Nikolaou, K., Pfannenberg, C., Schölkopf, B., Küstner, T., Cyran, C., & Rubin, D. (2022). A whole-body FDG-PET/CT Dataset with manually annotated Tumor Lesions. *Scientific Data*, 9, 601. https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-022-01207-5

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the findings:

1. **Dataset Name**: MICCIA2022 autoPET challenge
   - **Description**: A dataset containing 1014 sets of training data from 900 patients, including scans with malignant melanoma, lymphoma, lung cancer, and negative control patients. The authors used 220 scans with tumors for training and validation, and 30 scans for testing.
   - **Citation**: Gatidis, S., Hepp, T., Früh, M., La Fougère, C., Nikolaou, K., Pfannenberg, C., Schölkopf, B., Küstner, T., Cyran, C., & Rubin, D. (2022). A whole-body FDG-PET/CT Dataset with manually annotated Tumor Lesions. *Scientific Data*, 9, 601. https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-022-01207-5

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that the full citation is included for each dataset extracted from the paper.
