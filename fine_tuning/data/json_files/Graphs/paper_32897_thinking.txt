To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-level Adaptive Contrastive Learning for Knowledge Internalization in Dialogue Generation" by Chenxu Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that "extensive experiments on the WoW dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach," indicating that the WoW dataset is a key dataset used in their research.

Next, I will look into **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly state the datasets used for evaluation. They mention three datasets: **Holl-E**, **CMU_DoG**, and **WoW**. The authors discuss the limitations of the first two datasets and confirm that they ultimately chose the WoW dataset for their experiments.

In the **appendix**, the authors provide additional details about the WoW dataset, including its size and structure. They state that the WoW dataset consists of 22,311 dialogues with 201,999 turns, divided into training, validation, and test sets.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset from the **References section**:

1. **WoW Dataset**:
   > Dinan, E., Roller, S., Shuster, K., Fan, A., Auli, M., & Weston, J. (2018). Wizard of Wikipedia: Knowledge-powered conversational agents. CoRR, abs/1811.01241.

2. **Holl-E Dataset**:
   > Moghe, N., Arora, S., Banerjee, S., & Khapra, M. M. (2018). Towards exploiting background knowledge for building conversation systems. In Proceedings of the 2018 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 2322–2332, Brussels, Belgium. Association for Computational Linguistics.

3. **CMU_DoG Dataset**:
   > Zhou, K., Prabhumoye, S., & Black, A. W. (2018). A dataset for document grounded conversations. In Proceedings of the 2018 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 708–713, Brussels, Belgium. Association for Computational Linguistics.

After collecting this information, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

- **WoW Dataset**: The primary dataset used for experiments, consisting of 22,311 dialogues and 201,999 turns.
- **Holl-E Dataset**: Mentioned as a dataset but deemed unsuitable for the study's goals.
- **CMU_DoG Dataset**: Also mentioned but not used due to lack of labeled knowledge.

Finally, I will ensure that I have documented the full citations for each dataset clearly, as this is crucial for proper attribution and reference in any subsequent analysis or application of the research findings.
