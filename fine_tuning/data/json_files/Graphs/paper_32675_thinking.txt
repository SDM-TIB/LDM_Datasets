To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Supervised Stochastic Neighbor Embedding Using Contrastive Learning" by Yi Zhang, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on dimensionality reduction methods and mentions the use of self-supervised contrastive learning. However, it does not explicitly mention any datasets. I will proceed to the introduction for more context.

In the **introduction**, the author discusses various dimensionality reduction methods and their applications but does not specify any datasets. I will continue to the **method** and **experiments** sections, as these are likely to contain details about the datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section**. This section typically outlines the datasets used to validate the proposed methods. If the author has conducted experiments, they will likely describe the datasets, including their characteristics and how they were utilized in the study.

If I find any datasets mentioned, I will take note of their names, descriptions, and any relevant details provided by the author. I will also check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial, as proper citation is essential for academic integrity and allows others to locate the datasets.

If the paper references well-known datasets, I will ensure to include the original citations for those datasets, even if the paper does not provide them directly. 

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, into a structured format for clarity and ease of understanding.

In summary, my steps will be:
1. Read the abstract and introduction for initial context.
2. Examine the methods and experiments sections for dataset mentions.
3. Note down dataset names and descriptions.
4. Check the references for full citations.
5. Compile the information clearly and accurately.

By following this structured approach, I will ensure that I extract all relevant datasets and their citations from the paper effectively.
