To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Embedding Models for Episodic Knowledge Graphs" by Yunpu Maa et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors analyze their models on two datasets: the Global Database of Events, Language, and Tone (GDELT) and the Integrated Conflict Early Warning System (ICEWS). This is a strong indication that these datasets will be discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any relevant sections that might provide more information about these datasets. In the **experiments section**, the authors explicitly mention both datasets again, providing descriptions of their contents and characteristics.

1. **ICEWS Dataset**: The paper describes the ICEWS dataset as a natural episodic dataset that records dyadic events between different countries. It includes 258 entities, 20 relation types, and 72 timestamps, with a total of 320,118 positive quadruples. The dataset was first created and used in a previous work, which I will need to cite.

2. **GDELT Dataset**: The GDELT dataset is described as monitoring the world’s news media from various formats since January 1, 1979. For the experiments, data from January 1, 2012, to December 31, 2012, is used, containing 1100 entities, 180 relation types, and 366 timestamps, resulting in 2,563,561 positive quadruples.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **ICEWS dataset**, the citation is:
  > M. D. Ward, A. Beger, J. Cutler, M. Dickenson, C. Dorff, B. Radford. *Comparing GDELT and ICEWS Event Data*. Analysis 21 (2013) 267–297.

- For the **GDELT dataset**, the citation is:
  > M. D. Ward, A. Beger, J. Cutler, M. Dickenson, C. Dorff, B. Radford. *Comparing GDELT and ICEWS Event Data*. Analysis 21 (2013) 267–297.

Both datasets share the same citation as they are compared in the same study.

Finally, I will compile the extracted information into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all relevant details are captured accurately for future reference or processing.
