To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "SSTN: Self-Supervised Domain Adaptation Thermal Object Detection for Autonomous Driving" by Farzeen Munir et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimentation sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. In the abstract, the authors state that their method is evaluated on **two publicly available datasets: the FLIR-ADAS dataset and the KAIST Multi-Spectral dataset**. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for the research.

Next, I will look into the **experimentation section (Section IV)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used. Here, they mention:

1. **FLIR-ADAS Dataset**: This dataset contains 9,214 thermal and RGB image pairs, with objects annotated in MS-COCO format, including three class labels: car, person, and bicycle. The data is collected using the FLIR Tau2 camera, and each image has a resolution of 640 × 512. The authors also mention that both day and night time data is included.

2. **KAIST Multi-Spectral Dataset**: This dataset consists of 95,000 image pairs of thermal and RGB images, but only the person class is annotated. It is collected using the FLIR A35 camera with a resolution of 340 × 256, and it includes both day and night time images.

The authors also provide a standard split of the datasets for training and testing, which is useful for understanding how the datasets are utilized in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For the **FLIR-ADAS dataset**, the citation is:
  > FLIR. *FLIR ADAS Dataset*. Available at: https://www.flir.in/oem/adas/adas-dataset-form/

- For the **KAIST Multi-Spectral dataset**, the citation is:
  > S. Hwang, J. Park, N. Kim, Y. Choi, and I. So Kweon. *Multispectral pedestrian detection: Benchmark dataset and baseline*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2015, pp. 1037–1045.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented and properly cited.
