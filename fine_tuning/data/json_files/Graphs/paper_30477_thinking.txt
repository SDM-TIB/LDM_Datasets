To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Linguistic Investigation of Machine Learning based Contradiction Detection Models: An Empirical Analysis and Future Perspectives" by Maren Pielka et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and data sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors analyze two Natural Language Inference datasets, which suggests that there are specific datasets to extract.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention the **Stanford Natural Language Inference (SNLI)** dataset and a newly collected dataset in German. This gives me the names of the datasets I need to focus on.

Next, I will look into the **data section** where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets:

1. **Stanford Natural Language Inference (SNLI) Dataset**: This dataset is described as the largest collection of human-generated premise and hypothesis pairs for the NLI task, containing over 570,000 examples. The dataset was created through a crowd-sourcing campaign, and the final labels were decided by majority vote.

2. **Online Data Set**: This dataset consists of examples collected from various online sources in German, including news articles, tweets, and product reviews. It was manually annotated by workers to create pairs of sentences labeled as "contradiction," "no contradiction," or "exclude." The final dataset contains 40,589 examples after a thorough review process.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **SNLI dataset**, the citation is:
  > S. Bowman, G. Angeli, C. Potts, and C. Manning. *A Large Annotated Corpus for Learning Natural Language Inference*. In Proc. of EMNLP, 2015.

- The **Online Data Set** does not have a specific citation listed in the references, but it is mentioned that it will be made publicly available upon acceptance of the work.

With this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citation for the SNLI dataset and note the availability of the Online Data Set.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring clarity and completeness for future reference or processing.
