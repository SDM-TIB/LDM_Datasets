To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Few-shot Entity Recognition in Document Images: A Graph Neural Network Approach Robust to Image Manipulation" by Prashant Krishnan et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on two benchmark datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors discuss the challenges of entity recognition in document images and mention the use of two benchmark datasets. This reinforces the expectation that the datasets will be explicitly named in the subsequent sections.

In the **experiments section**, specifically **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, the authors provide clear details about the datasets used:

1. **FUNSD**: This dataset consists of 199 fully-annotated, noisy-scanned forms with various appearances and formats. The word spans in this dataset are annotated with three different labels: header, question, and answer, while the rest are labeled as other.

2. **CORD**: This dataset contains about 1000 receipts with annotations of bounding boxes and textual contents. The word spans in this dataset are annotated with 30 different labels, including categories like menu, sub-total, and total.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **FUNSD**, the citation is:
  > Guillaume Jaume, Hazim Kemal Ekenel. *FUNSD: A Dataset for Form Understanding in Noisy Scanned Documents*. In Accepted to ICDAR-OST, 2019.

- For **CORD**, the citation is:
  > Seunghyun Park, Seung Shin, Bado Lee, Junyeop Lee, Jaeheung Surh, Minjoon Seo, and Hwalsuk Lee. *CORD: A Consolidated Receipt Dataset for Post-OCR Parsing*. In Proceedings of the 2019 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), 2019.

With the dataset names and their citations in hand, I will now prepare to create structured entries for each dataset, ensuring that the full citations are included as required.
