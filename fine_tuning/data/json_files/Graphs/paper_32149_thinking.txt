To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Uncertainty Quantification via Spatial-Temporal Tweedie Model for Zero-inflated and Long-tail Travel Demand Prediction" by Xinke Jiang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluated their model using real-world datasets, which indicates that datasets are present.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Numerical Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. They mention two datasets:

1. **Chicago Data Portal (CDP)**: This dataset includes trip records of ride-sharing companies in Chicago’s 77 zones every 15 minutes, covering the period from January 9, 2019, to December 30, 2019. The authors state that they randomly selected 10 × 10 grids of O-D pairs from this dataset.

2. **Smart Location Database (SLD)**: This dataset contains For-Hire Vehicle trip records in 67 Manhattan administrative zones. The authors mention that they altered the temporal resolution (5/15/60-minute intervals) and sampled 10 × 10 / 67 × 67 O-D pairs to evaluate their model's performance.

To ensure I have the full citations for these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper. However, the datasets themselves may not have formal citations in the same way that academic papers do. Instead, I will note the URLs provided for accessing these datasets:

- For the **Chicago Data Portal (CDP)**, the URL is:
  > https://data.cityofchicago.org/Transportation/Transportation-Network-Providers-Trips/m6dm-c72p

- For the **Smart Location Database (SLD)**, the URL is:
  > https://www1.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page

Now, I will compile the information about each dataset, including their names, descriptions, and URLs, ensuring that I provide clear and accurate details for each.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will prepare the dataset entries for further processing or review.
