To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Neural Improvement Heuristics for Graph Combinatorial Optimization Problems" by Andoni I. Garmendia et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the application of the proposed model to various combinatorial optimization problems, which suggests that datasets may be involved.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **introduction**. The authors reference the Preference Ranking Problem (PRP), the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), and the Graph Partitioning Problem (GPP). I need to determine if these problems are associated with specific datasets or if they are based on standard benchmarks.

In the **experiments section**, the authors describe their experimental setup and mention using randomly generated instances for training and evaluation. They also refer to the Linear Ordering Problem (LOP) and the XLOLIB benchmark for testing the model's performance. This indicates that the authors utilized specific datasets for their experiments.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The key datasets identified are:

1. **XLOLIB**: This is a benchmark library for the Linear Ordering Problem. The citation for the XLOLIB is:
   > G. Reinelt. *Linear ordering library (LOLIB)*. University of Heidelberg, 2002.

2. **Randomly generated instances**: While these are not a formal dataset, they are mentioned as part of the experimental setup. The authors do not provide a specific citation for these instances, as they are likely generated using their own methodology.

3. **Preference Ranking Problem (PRP)**, **Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)**, and **Graph Partitioning Problem (GPP)**: These are well-known problems in combinatorial optimization, but they do not correspond to specific datasets with citations. Instead, they are frameworks within which the authors applied their model.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for the identified datasets. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
