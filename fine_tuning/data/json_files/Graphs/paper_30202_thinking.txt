To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Disentangled Graph Contrastive Learning for Review-based Recommendation" by Haonan Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on "five benchmark datasets," which indicates that there are specific datasets used in their research. I will look for the names of these datasets in the introduction.

Next, I will navigate to the **experiments section** (Section 5) where the authors typically provide details about the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, I will look for any tables or descriptions that list the datasets, their characteristics, and any relevant statistics.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find a **Table 1** that summarizes the statistics of the datasets used in the experiments. The datasets listed are:

1. **Toys and Games**: This dataset has 19,412 users, 11,924 items, and 167,597 reviews, with a density of 0.072%.
2. **Clothing**: This dataset has 16,638 users, 39,387 items, and 278,677 reviews, with a density of 0.448%.
3. **Office Products**: This dataset has 10,217 users, 4,905 items, and 66,519 reviews, with a density of 0.031%.
4. **Home and Kitchen**: This dataset has 23,033 users, 2,420 items, and 53,228 reviews, with a density of 0.029%.
5. **Tools and Home Improvement**: This dataset has 134,476 users, 551,682 items, and 278,677 reviews, with a density of 0.079%.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. However, since these datasets are commonly used benchmark datasets in the field of recommendation systems, they may not have specific citations in the references. Instead, I will note that they are derived from the Amazon review dataset, which is widely recognized in the literature.

Now, I will compile the information about each dataset, including their names, characteristics, and any relevant citations if available. If no specific citations are found, I will mention that they are part of the Amazon review dataset.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for easy reference or further processing.
