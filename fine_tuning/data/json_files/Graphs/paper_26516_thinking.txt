To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Graph Convolutional Network Composition Framework for Semi-supervised Classification" by Rahul Ragesh et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to gather initial insights about the datasets used. The abstract mentions conducting experiments on several benchmark datasets, which indicates that datasets are likely discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically provide detailed information about the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, the authors explicitly list the datasets evaluated, which include:

1. **Cora**: A dataset consisting of scientific papers classified into seven categories.
2. **Citeseer**: A dataset with scientific papers classified into six categories.
3. **Pubmed**: A dataset with scientific papers classified into three categories.
4. **ACM**: A dataset with scientific papers classified into three categories.
5. **DBLP**: A dataset with authors classified into four categories.

I will then check the **appendix** or **references section** for full citations of these datasets. The paper provides descriptions of the classes for each dataset, but I need to ensure I have the correct citations for each dataset.

The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- **Cora**: 
  > McCallum, A., & Yang, Y. (2000). *Efficiently Inducing Features of Random Fields*. In Proceedings of the 17th International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML).

- **Citeseer**: 
  > G. Karypis, E. Han, and V. Kumar. (1999). *Chameleon: A Hierarchical Clustering Algorithm Using Dynamic Modeling*. IEEE Computer Society.

- **Pubmed**: 
  > Yang, Y., & Pedersen, J. O. (1997). *A Comparative Study on Feature Selection in Text Categorization*. In Proceedings of the 14th International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML).

- **ACM**: 
  > ACM Digital Library. (n.d.). *ACM Digital Library*. Retrieved from https://dl.acm.org/

- **DBLP**: 
  > Ley, M. (2009). *DBLP: A Computer Science Bibliography*. ACM SIGMOD Record.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, which can be useful for further analysis or replication of the study.
