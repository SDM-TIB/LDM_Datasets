To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CoCoNet: Coupled Contrastive Learning Network with Multi-level Feature Ensemble for Multi-modality Image Fusion" by Jinyuan Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that the proposed method is applied to **medical image fusion of different types**, which suggests that datasets related to medical imaging might be included.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (specifically section 4.1), where the authors describe the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they explicitly mention two datasets:

1. **TNO Dataset**: This dataset is widely used for infrared and visible image fusion, and the authors state that it is adopted as a benchmark for training their network due to its high-quality images with distinctive scenarios.

2. **RoadScene Dataset**: This dataset includes realistic driving scenes with 221 representative image pairs collected from authentic driving videos. It is used to evaluate the performance of the proposed method in real-world scenarios.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

- For the **TNO Dataset**, the citation is:
  > TNO. *TNO Image Fusion Dataset*. Available at: https://figshare.com/articles/TNO_Image_Fusion_Dataset/1008029.

- For the **RoadScene Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Xu, H., Ma, J. *RoadScene Dataset for Image Fusion*. Available at: [insert appropriate link if available].

Now that I have the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use.

In summary, I will ensure that I have accurately identified the datasets, their descriptions, and their full citations, which are essential for any downstream processing or review.
