To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Scalable Property Valuation Models via Graph-Based Deep Learning" by Enrique Riveros et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments using a **proprietary dataset comprising approximately 200,000 houses located in Santiago, Chile**. This suggests that there is a significant dataset involved, but I need to gather more details.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental results section** (Section 4), where the authors describe the dataset in more detail. They mention that the final dataset consists of **225,000 houses** described by **50 explanatory variables** collected over the period from **2009 to 2019**. This dataset is crucial for their analysis and model evaluation.

In this section, the authors also discuss the **exclusion criteria** used to filter out noisy samples, which provides insight into the dataset's quality and relevance. They describe how they filtered the data based on the appraisal for taxation purposes, transaction prices, and other criteria, ensuring that the dataset is robust for their analysis.

Additionally, they mention that they created **eight additional datasets** by defining groups of adjacent communes, which are detailed in a table. This indicates that there are multiple subsets of the original dataset that could be relevant for different analyses.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. However, since the primary dataset is proprietary and not publicly available, I will note that the citation for the dataset itself may not be applicable. Instead, I will focus on the references that discuss methodologies or similar datasets used in the context of property valuation.

The authors reference several studies and methodologies related to property valuation, including:

1. **Peer Dependence Valuation Model (PDVM)**:
   > J. Bin, B. Gardiner, E. Li, and Z. Liu. "Peer-dependence valuation model for real estate appraisal." *Data-Enabled Discovery and Applications*, vol. 3, no. 1, p. 2, 2019.

2. **Graph Convolutional Network-based Model**:
   > Z. Yang, Z. Hong, R. Zhou, and H. Ai. "Graph convolutional network-based model for megacity real estate valuation." *IEEE Access*, vol. 10, pp. 104 811–104 828, 2022.

3. **Automated Valuation Models**:
   > S. C. Tekouabou et al. "AI-based on machine learning methods for urban real estate prediction: a systematic survey." *Archives of Computational Methods in Engineering*, vol. 31, no. 2, pp. 1079–1095, 2024.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **Proprietary Dataset**: Approximately 225,000 houses in Santiago, Chile, with 50 explanatory variables.
   - Citation: Not applicable (proprietary dataset).

2. **Additional Datasets**: Eight datasets created based on groups of adjacent communes.
   - Citation: Not applicable (derived from the proprietary dataset).

3. **Related Methodologies**: References to methodologies that may involve similar datasets.
   - Citation for PDVM: J. Bin et al. (2019).
   - Citation for Graph Convolutional Network: Z. Yang et al. (2022).
   - Citation for AI-based methods: S. C. Tekouabou et al. (2024).

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
