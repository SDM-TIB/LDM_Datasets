To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Dance of the ADS: Orchestrating Failures through Historically-Informed Scenario Fuzzing" by Tong Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned or referenced. The abstract discusses the methodology and results but does not explicitly mention datasets. However, it does refer to the use of map road networks like **OPENDRIVE**, which may indicate a dataset.

Next, I will examine the **methodology** and **experiments** sections, particularly focusing on any subsections that might detail the datasets used. In the methodology, the authors mention using **map crawling technology** to extract data from road networks, specifically referencing **OPENDRIVE** as a foundational scenario seed corpus. This suggests that OPENDRIVE is a dataset used in their experiments.

I will also look for any specific references to datasets in the **results** or **evaluation** sections. The paper discusses various experiments and findings but does not introduce new datasets beyond what has already been mentioned.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the OPENDRIVE dataset. The OPENDRIVE format is widely used in autonomous driving research, and its citation is typically found in related works. I will look for a relevant reference that discusses OPENDRIVE.

After reviewing the references, I find that the OPENDRIVE dataset is often cited as follows:
> OpenDRIVE. *OpenDRIVE Specification*. [Online]. Available: https://www.opendrive.org/

Since the paper does not provide a specific citation for OPENDRIVE, I will use the general citation format for datasets.

Finally, I will compile the identified datasets into a structured format, ensuring to include the full citation for each dataset as required.

In summary, the identified dataset from the paper is:
1. **OPENDRIVE**: A dataset used for extracting essential data to form a foundational scenario seed corpus for autonomous driving systems.

The citation for OPENDRIVE is:
> OpenDRIVE. *OpenDRIVE Specification*. [Online]. Available: https://www.opendrive.org/

With this information, I am ready to create the dataset entries as needed.
