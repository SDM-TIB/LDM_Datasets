To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Scalable Power Control/Beamforming in Heterogeneous Wireless Networks with Graph Neural Networks" by Xiaochen Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often discusses the context and previous work, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments or results sections**. In this paper, the authors may describe the datasets used for training and testing their proposed model, HIGNN. I will pay attention to any specific names or descriptions of datasets, including their characteristics and the context in which they were used.

If the paper does not have a dedicated section for datasets, I will check the **references** for any citations that might indicate the datasets used. This could include papers that introduced the datasets or provided benchmarks relevant to the research.

After identifying the datasets, I will ensure to gather the **full citations** for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This is crucial for proper attribution and for readers who may want to access the datasets themselves.

For example, if the authors mention using a dataset like the "Wireless Communication Dataset" for their experiments, I will look for the original source of this dataset in the references section and note down the complete citation.

Finally, I will compile the information about each dataset, including its name, description, and full citation, ensuring that I have accurately represented the datasets as described in the paper.

By following these steps, I will be able to extract and document the datasets used in the research effectively.
