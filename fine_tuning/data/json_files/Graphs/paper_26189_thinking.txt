To extract datasets from the research paper titled "OD-GCN: Object Detection Boosted by Knowledge GCN" by Zheng Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors tested their method on the **COCO dataset**, which is a significant indication that this dataset is used in their experiments.

Next, I will examine the **related work** section to see if there are any other datasets referenced. Here, the authors mention several well-known datasets, including **ImageNet** and **PASCAL VOC**, but the focus remains on the **COCO dataset** for their specific experiments.

Moving on to the **approach** section, I will look for any detailed descriptions of how the datasets are utilized. The authors mention that the knowledge graph is built using the **COCO 2014 training dataset**, which confirms the dataset's relevance to their methodology.

In the **experiments** section, the authors provide a detailed account of their testing on the **MSCOCO 2014 Minival dataset**, which is a subset of the COCO dataset. They describe the dataset's composition, stating it contains 8,060 validation images, further solidifying its importance in their research.

Finally, I will check the **references section** to gather the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The citations I need to extract are:

1. For the **COCO dataset**:
   > T. Lin, M. Maire, S. Belongie, J. Hays, P. Perona, D. Ramanan, P. Dollár, and C. L. Zitnick. *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. In Proceedings of the European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), pages 740–755, 2014.

2. For the **ImageNet dataset**:
   > J. Deng, W. Dong, R. Socher, L. Li, K. Li, and F. Li. *ImageNet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 248-255, 2009.

3. For the **PASCAL VOC dataset**:
   > M. Everingham, L. V. Gool, C. K. Williams, J. Winn, and A. Zisserman. *The PASCAL Visual Object Classes (VOC) Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision (IJCV), vol. 88, no. 2, pp. 303–338, 2010.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations.
