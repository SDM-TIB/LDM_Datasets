To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Beyond Counting Datasets: A Survey of Multilingual Dataset Construction and Necessary Resources" by Xinyan Velocity Yu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors examine the characteristics of 156 publicly available NLP datasets, which indicates that multiple datasets are discussed throughout the paper. The introduction further emphasizes the disparities in dataset availability across languages, hinting at the presence of specific datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology** and **results sections** where the authors describe their survey process and findings. In these sections, they detail the datasets they analyzed, including their sources and characteristics. I will look for any explicit mentions of dataset names, sizes, and the languages they cover.

In the **results section**, the authors provide statistics on the datasets, including their task types and input sources. They mention that they studied 156 datasets, each covering at least one non-English language, and provide a breakdown of these datasets by various attributes. I will carefully note down the names of the datasets and any relevant details provided.

I will also check the **tables and figures** throughout the paper, as they often summarize key information about the datasets. For instance, Table 1 outlines the annotation scheme, while other tables provide statistics on dataset characteristics, which may include dataset names.

Once I have identified the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to obtain the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This is crucial for ensuring that I have accurate and complete citations for each dataset.

For example, if the authors mention a dataset like "TyDi QA," I will look for its citation in the references, which might be formatted as follows:
> Clark, J. H., Choi, E., Collins, M., Garrette, D., Kwiatkowski, T., Nikolaev, V., & Palomaki, J. (2020). TyDi QA: A benchmark for information-seeking question answering in typologically diverse languages. *Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics*, 8, 454-470.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described with its name, characteristics, and full citation. This structured approach will help me create a comprehensive overview of the datasets discussed in the paper, ready for further analysis or processing.
