To extract datasets from the research paper titled "RecBole 2.0: Towards a More Up-to-Date Recommendation Library" by Wayne Xin Zhao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the library and its purpose, but I need to look for specific datasets in the main body of the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Package Details and Usage)**, particularly the **Data-oriented Packages** and **Model-oriented Packages** subsections. Here, the authors discuss various packages developed for different data issues and model architectures. I will look for any datasets explicitly mentioned in relation to these packages.

In the **Debiased recommendation (RecBole-Debias)** section, the authors mention three major debiasing datasets: **Yahoo!R3**, **ML-100k**, and **KuaiRec**. I will note these datasets as they are directly relevant to the experiments conducted in the paper.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The citations I will extract are:

1. **Yahoo!R3**:
   > Tobias Schnabel, Adith Swaminathan, Ashudeep Singh, Navin Chandak, and Thorsten Joachims. *Recommendations as treatments: Debiasing learning and evaluation*. In International Conference on Machine Learning, PMLR, 2016, 1670â€“1679.

2. **ML-100k**:
   > F. Maxwell Harper and Joseph A. Konstan. *The MovieLens Datasets: History and Context*. ACM Transactions on Interactive Intelligent Systems, 5(4):19, 2015.

3. **KuaiRec**:
   > Chongming Gao, Shijun Li, Wenqiang Lei, Biao Li, Peng Jiang, Jiawei Chen, Xiangnan He, Jiaxin Mao, and Tat-Seng Chua. *KuaiRec: A Fully-observed Dataset for Recommender Systems*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2202.10842, 2022.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described accurately and includes its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
