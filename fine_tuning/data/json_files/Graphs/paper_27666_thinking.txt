To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Implicit Regularization in Deep Tensor Factorization" by Paolo Milanesi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on both synthetic and real data, which suggests that there are datasets involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental analysis section**. Here, the authors describe their experiments in detail. They mention two types of datasets: **synthetic data** and **real data**. 

1. **Synthetic Data**: The authors generated a 30 × 30 × 30 tensor with Tucker-rank equal to (6, 6, 6) and a 4-th order tensor of size 12 × 12 × 12 × 12 with TT-rank equal to (1, 6, 6, 6, 1). However, since these are synthetic datasets, they do not have formal citations.

2. **Real Data**: The paper specifically mentions two real datasets:
   - **Comprehensive Climate Data Set (CCDS)**: This dataset contains monthly observations of 17 variables such as carbon dioxide and temperature spanning from 1990 to 2001 across 125 observation locations, resulting in a 138 × 17 × 125 tensor. The authors provide a link to the dataset: https://viterbi-web.usc.edu/liu32/data.html.
   - **Meteo-UK Data Set**: Collected from the meteorological office in the UK, this dataset contains monthly measurements of 5 variables across 16 stations from 1960 to 2000, resulting in a 492 × 5 × 16 tensor. The authors also provide a link to this dataset: http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/public/weather/climate-historic.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. However, since the synthetic datasets do not have citations, I will only focus on the real datasets.

For the **CCDS**, the citation is:
> A. C. Lozano, H. Li, A. Niculescu-Mizil, Y. Liu, C. Perlich, J. Hosking, and N. Abe. *Spatial-temporal causal modeling for climate change attribution*. In Proceedings of the KDD, 2009.

For the **Meteo-UK Data Set**, there is no specific citation provided in the references, but the dataset is attributed to the UK Met Office.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for the real datasets while noting that the synthetic datasets do not have formal citations. 

This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture the datasets and their citations from the paper.
