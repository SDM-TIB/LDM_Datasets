To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Studying the Impact of Data Disclosure Mechanism in Recommender Systems via Simulation" by Ziqian Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on "two real-world representative datasets," which indicates that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.2 (Experiment Setup)**, where the authors provide details about the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they explicitly mention two datasets:

1. **Movielens-100k (ML-100k)**: This is a well-known benchmark dataset for evaluating recommendation algorithms, containing 100,000 user ratings. The authors specify that they use the version that includes these ratings.

2. **Yelp**: This dataset is described as a popular and continuously updated dataset for business recommendations. The authors note that they used the version downloaded on February 16, 2021, which includes all review records written before that date.

To ensure I have the full citations for these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **Movielens-100k**, the citation is:
  > F. Maxwell Harper and Joseph A. Konstan. *The MovieLens Datasets: History and Context*. ACM Trans. Interact. Intell. Syst. 5, 4, Article 19 (December 2015), 19 pages. https://doi.org/10.1145/2827872

- For **Yelp**, the citation is:
  > Yelp Dataset. *Yelp Dataset Challenge*. https://www.yelp.com/dataset

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will summarize the information for each dataset, ensuring to include the full citations as required.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
