To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "Jitter Does Matter: Adapting Gaze Estimation to New Domains" by Ruicong Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions evaluating the proposed method on four cross-domain gaze estimation tasks, which suggests that multiple datasets are involved. I will look for specific names of datasets in these sections.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section 5) closely, particularly the **data preparation subsection** (5.1). Here, the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments:

1. **ETH-XGaze**: This dataset is described as providing 80 subjects and a total of 756,540 images. The authors use this dataset as a source domain.

2. **Gaze360**: This dataset contains 112,251 images after filtering out images without subjects' faces. It is also used as a source domain.

3. **MPIIGaze**: The authors mention using this dataset for evaluation, which contains 3,000 images generated from a provided evaluation protocol.

4. **EyeDiap**: This dataset consists of 16,674 images from 14 subjects and is used as a target domain.

After identifying these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **ETH-XGaze**, the citation is:

- For **Gaze360**, the citation is:

- For **MPIIGaze**, the citation is:

- For **EyeDiap**, the citation is:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured all necessary details regarding the datasets used in the research paper.
