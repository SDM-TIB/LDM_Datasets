To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Improving Fairness of Automated Chest X-ray Diagnosis by Contrastive Learning" by Mingquan Lin et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their method on two datasets, which is a good starting point.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of fairness in AI models and mention the need for datasets that can help address bias in CXR diagnosis. This section may provide context but may not name specific datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, specifically the subsection titled "Dataset Acquisition." Here, the authors explicitly mention two datasets:

1. **Medical Imaging and Data Resource Center (MIDRC) dataset**: This dataset contains 77,887 chest X-ray (CXR) images from 27,796 patients, collected for COVID-19 diagnosis. The authors provide details about the dataset's collection and demographic information.

2. **NIH Chest X-ray (NIH-CXR) dataset**: This dataset consists of 112,120 CXR images from 30,805 patients, collected between 1992 and 2015. The authors describe the types of thoracic abnormalities included in this dataset.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For the **MIDRC dataset**, the citation is:
> Lakhani, P., Mongan, J., Singhal, C., Zhou, Q., Andriole, K. P., Auffermann, W. F., Prasanna, P. M., Pham, T. X., Peterson, M., Bergquist, P. J., Cook, T. S., Ferraciolli, S. F., Corradi, G. C. A., Takahashi, M. S., Workman, C. S., Parekh, M., Kamel, S. I., Galant, J., Mas-Sanchez, A., Benitez, E. C., Sanchez-Valverde, M., Jaques, L., Panadero, M., Vidal, M., CuliaÃ±ez-Casas, D., Angulo-Gonzalez, D., Langer, S. G., de la Iglesia-Vaya, M., & Shih, G. (2023). The 2021 SIIM-FISABIO-RSNA machine learning COVID-19 challenge: Annotation and standard exam classification of COVID-19 chest radiographs. *Journal of Digital Imaging*, 36(1), 365-372. doi: 10.1007/s10278-022-00706-8.

For the **NIH-CXR dataset**, the citation is:
> Johnson, A. E. W., Pollard, T. J., Berkowitz, S., Greenbaum, N. R., Lungren, M. P., Deng, C.-Y., Mark, R. G., & Horng, S. (2019). MIMIC-CXR: A large publicly available database of labeled chest radiographs. *arXiv preprint arXiv:1901.07042*.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or processing. This systematic approach ensures that I capture all relevant details and provide proper citations for each dataset.
