To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Dive into the Details of Self-Supervised Learning for Medical Image Analysis" by Chuyan Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions a "large-scale, in-depth and fine-grained study through extensive experiments on predictive, contrastive, generative and multi-SSL algorithms," which suggests that multiple datasets may be involved.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **introduction**. The authors discuss various medical imaging tasks and refer to "a variety of studies" that have demonstrated the effectiveness of self-supervised learning approaches across different medical image recognition tasks. This indicates that there may be datasets referenced later in the paper.

In the **methodology section**, the authors describe the experiments conducted and mention specific datasets used for training and evaluation. I will pay close attention to any tables or figures that summarize the datasets, as they often provide concise information about the datasets used, including their sizes and characteristics.

I will also check the **results section** for any additional context or details about the datasets, especially if the authors discuss the performance of their methods on these datasets.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets.

From my reading, I will extract the following datasets:

1. **LUNA 2016 Dataset**: This dataset is mentioned as containing 888 low-dose chest CT scans used for pretraining. The citation is:
   > Setio, A.A.A., Traverso, A., De Bel, T., Berens, M.S., Van Den Bogaard, C., Cerello, P., Chen, H., Dou, Q., Fantacci, M.E., Geurts, B., et al. (2017). Validation, comparison, and combination of algorithms for automatic detection of pulmonary nodules in computed tomography images: the luna16 challenge. *Medical Image Analysis*, 42, 1-13.

2. **LIDC-IDRI Dataset**: This dataset consists of 1018 lung CT scans used for the NCS task. The citation is:
   > Armato III, S.G., McLennan, G., Bidaut, L., McNitt-Gray, M.F., Meyer, C.R., Reeves, A.P., Zhao, B., Aberle, D.R., Henschke, C.I., Hoffman, E.A., et al. (2011). The lung image database consortium (lidc) and image database resource initiative (idri): a completed reference database of lung nodules on ct scans. *Medical Physics*, 38(915-931).

3. **LiTS Dataset**: This dataset is used for liver segmentation tasks and is referenced as part of the MSD-Liver dataset. The citation is:
   > Bilic, P., Christ, P.F., Vorontsov, E., Chlebus, G., Chen, H., Dou, Q., Fu, C.W., Han, X., Heng, P.A., Hesser, J., et al. (2019). The liver tumor segmentation benchmark (LiTS). *arXiv preprint arXiv:1901.04056*.

4. **EyePACS Dataset**: This dataset is used for diabetic retinopathy classification and consists of 28k fundus images. The citation is:
   > EyePACS. (2015). Available at: https://www.kaggle.com/c/diabetic-retinopathy-detection/.

5. **DRIVE Dataset**: This dataset is used for retinal vessel segmentation and is referenced in the context of the DVS task. The citation is:
   > Niemeijer, M., Staal, J., Van Ginneken, B., Loog, M., Abramoﬀ, M.D. (2004). Comparative study of retinal vessel segmentation methods on a new publicly available database. *Medical Imaging 2004: Image Processing*, SPIE, 648–656.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for easy reference and ensure that all citations are complete and accurate.
