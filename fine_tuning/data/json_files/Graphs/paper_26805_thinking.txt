To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CatGCN: Graph Convolutional Networks with Categorical Node Features" by Weijian Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors demonstrate their model on user profiling tasks using datasets from Tencent and Alibaba, indicating that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically **section 3.1.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they explicitly mention three datasets:

1. **Tencent-age Dataset**: This dataset is derived from the social networking platform Tencent Weibo, focusing on predicting user age levels. It consists of 51,378 nodes (users) with 309 categorical features and 64,514 edges.

2. **Alibaba-purchase Dataset**: This dataset is related to click-through rates for display ads on Alibaba's Taobao platform, used for predicting user purchase levels. It contains 166,958 nodes with 2,820 categorical features.

3. **Alibaba-city Dataset**: Similar to the Alibaba-purchase dataset, this dataset is also from Alibaba and is used for predicting the city level of users. It has the same number of nodes and features as the Alibaba-purchase dataset.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The paper cites the datasets as follows:

- For the **Tencent-age Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Chen, W., Feng, F., Wang, Q., He, X., Song, C., Ling, G., & Zhang, Y. (2021). *CatGCN: Graph Convolutional Networks with Categorical Node Features*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM), pages 1-10.

- For the **Alibaba-purchase Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Chen, W., Feng, F., Wang, Q., He, X., Song, C., Ling, G., & Zhang, Y. (2021). *CatGCN: Graph Convolutional Networks with Categorical Node Features*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM), pages 1-10.

- For the **Alibaba-city Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Chen, W., Feng, F., Wang, Q., He, X., Song, C., Ling, G., & Zhang, Y. (2021). *CatGCN: Graph Convolutional Networks with Categorical Node Features*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM), pages 1-10.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This structured approach will help in accurately documenting the datasets used in the research.
