To extract datasets from the research paper titled "FairEGM: Fair Link Prediction and Recommendation via Emulated Graph Modification" by Sean Current et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections. In the abstract, the authors mention that they demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach on **four real-world datasets**. This indicates that there are datasets to be identified.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology or experiments sections**. In this paper, the authors provide a detailed description of the datasets in **section 5 (Experiments)**, where they list the datasets used for their experiments.

The datasets mentioned are:

1. **Citeseer**: This dataset consists of 3,327 nodes, 4,732 edges, and 3,703 features, with a sensitive attribute related to topic classification (6 topics).
2. **Cora**: This dataset contains 2,708 nodes, 5,278 edges, and 1,433 features, with a sensitive attribute related to topic classification (7 topics).
3. **Facebook-1684**: This dataset has 786 nodes, 14,024 edges, and 317 features, with a sensitive attribute related to gender (2 categories).
4. **Pubmed**: This dataset includes 19,717 nodes, 44,327 edges, and 500 features, with a sensitive attribute related to topic classification (3 topics).

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The paper does not provide specific citations for the datasets directly, but it does mention that the Citeseer, Cora, and Pubmed datasets can be found at a specific URL (https://linqs.soe.ucsc.edu/data), and the Facebook dataset is available at another URL (https://snap.stanford.edu/data/).

Based on this information, I will compile the dataset entries with the necessary details, including the dataset names, descriptions, and URLs for reference.

Finally, I will ensure that I format the dataset information clearly and accurately, including the full citation for the datasets as they are referenced in the paper.

After gathering all this information, I will be ready to present the datasets in the required format for further processing or review.
