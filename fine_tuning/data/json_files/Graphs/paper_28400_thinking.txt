To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Global Context Enhanced Social Recommendation with Hierarchical Graph Neural Networks" by Huance Xu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that empirical results were demonstrated on **three public benchmarks**, which indicates that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experimentation section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this case, the authors mention three datasets: **Epinions**, **Ciao**, and **Douban**. I will look for specific details about each dataset, such as the number of users, items, interactions, and any unique characteristics.

In the **data description subsection**, the authors provide statistics for each dataset:

1. **Epinions**: 
   - Number of Users: 22,164
   - Number of Items: 7,375
   - Number of User-Item Interactions: 296,277
   - Social Ties: 111,781

2. **Ciao**: 
   - Number of Users: 10,060
   - Number of Items: 105,060
   - Number of User-Item Interactions: 912,441
   - Social Ties: 355,631

3. **Douban**: 
   - Number of Users: 50,694
   - Number of Items: 24,088
   - Number of User-Item Interactions: 3,523,157
   - Social Ties: 439,893

Next, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for these datasets. The authors typically cite the original sources of the datasets they used. 

For the datasets mentioned, I will look for the following citations:

- **Epinions**: 
  > "Epinions dataset is collected from the Epinions website, a consumer review site where users can establish social ties."

- **Ciao**: 
  > "Ciao dataset is collected from the Ciao website, which allows users to review products and establish social connections."

- **Douban**: 
  > "Douban dataset is collected from Douban, a popular Chinese online review platform."

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described with its respective citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring that all relevant details are included for each dataset.
