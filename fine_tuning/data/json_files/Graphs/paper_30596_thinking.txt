To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MATERIALS PROPERTY PREDICTION WITH UNCERTAINTY QUANTIFICATION: A BENCHMARK STUDY" by Daniel Varivoda et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract states that the authors conducted experiments over **four crystal materials datasets**. This indicates that there are specific datasets to look for.

Next, I will navigate to the **Methods** section, particularly the subsection titled **2.6 Data sets**, where the authors provide detailed information about the datasets used in their study. Here, they list the datasets along with their properties, sources, and the number of samples.

The datasets mentioned are:

1. **Bulk Materials Formation Energy**: 
   - Unit: eV/atom
   - Source: MaterialsProject [16]
   - Number of samples: 36,839

2. **Alloy Surface Adsorption Energy**: 
   - Unit: eV
   - Source: CatHub [64]
   - Number of samples: 37,334

3. **Pt-cluster Total Energy**: 
   - Unit: eV
   - Source: Literature [65]
   - Number of samples: 19,801

4. **MOF Band Gap**: 
   - Unit: eV
   - Source: QMOF [66]
   - Number of samples: 18,321

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset source. The citations are as follows:

- For **MaterialsProject**:
  > Jain, A., Ong, S. P., Hautier, G., Chen, W., Richards, W. D., Dacek, S., Cholia, S., Gunter, D., Skinner, D., Ceder, G., et al. (2013). *Commentary: The materials project: A materials genome approach to accelerating materials innovation*. APL Materials, 1(1), 011002.

- For **CatHub**:

- For **Literature** (specific reference not provided in the text, but it refers to previous works):
  > Fung, V., & Jiang, D. (2017). *Exploring structural diversity and fluxionality of Pt_n (n=10–13) clusters from first-principles*. The Journal of Physical Chemistry C, 121(20), 10796-10802.

- For **QMOF**:
  > Rosen, A. S., Iyer, S. M., Ray, D., Yao, Z., Aspuru-Guzik, A., Gagliardi, L., Notestein, J. M., & Snurr, R. Q. (2021). *Machine learning the quantum-chemical properties of metal–organic frameworks for accelerated materials discovery*. Matter, 4(5), 1578-1597.

Now that I have gathered the dataset information and their citations, I will compile this into a structured format for further processing or review.
