To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Cascaded Self-supervised Learning for Subject-independent EEG-based Emotion Recognition" by Hanqi Wang, Tao Chen, and Liang Song, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. In the abstract, the authors mention that their method demonstrates superior performance on the **DEAP** and **DREAMER** datasets, indicating that these are the datasets used in their experiments.

Next, I will look for more detailed descriptions of these datasets in the **experiments section**. In section 4.1, the authors provide specific information about both datasets:

1. **DEAP Dataset**: This dataset is described as a multi-modal dataset focused on human affective computing, consisting of 32 subjects, each participating in 40 trials. The subjects watched one-minute music videos and self-reported their emotional states in arousal and valence dimensions. The EEG signals were recorded at 512 Hz and down-sampled to 128 Hz.

2. **DREAMER Dataset**: This dataset features recordings of 14-channel EEG signals captured during affect-inducing audio-visual stimuli, with 23 subjects watching 18 movie clips. Participants rated their arousal and valence using self-assessment manikins (SAM) scores from 1 to 5.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **DEAP Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Koelstra, S., Muhl, C., Soleymani, M., Lee, J.-S., Yazdani, A., Ebrahimi, T., Pun, T., Nijholt, A., & Patras, I. (2011). DEAP: A database for emotion analysis using physiological signals. *IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing*, 3(1), 18-31.

- For the **DREAMER Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Katsigiannis, S., & Ramzan, N. (2017). DREAMER: A database for emotion recognition through EEG and ECG signals from wireless low-cost off-the-shelf devices. *IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics*, 22(1), 98-107.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all details are accurately represented for future reference or processing.
