To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Information-guided pixel augmentation for pixel-wise contrastive learning" by Quan Quan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, and I will look for any references to datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** in detail, particularly the part where the authors describe their methodology and the datasets they utilized. In this paper, the authors mention three datasets:

1. **Cephalometric Dataset**: This dataset is widely used for cephalometric landmark detection and contains 400 radiographs with 19 landmarks labeled by expert doctors.

2. **Hand X-ray Dataset**: This dataset consists of 909 X-ray images of hands, with the first 609 images used for training and the remaining for testing.

3. **H&N 3D Dataset**: This is a 3D dataset constructed with landmarks marked via segmentation masks from a mixed head and neck CT dataset.

After identifying these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **Cephalometric Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Ching-Wei Wang, Cheng-Ta Huang, Jia-Hong Lee, Chung-Hsing Li, Sheng-Wei Chang, Ming-Jhih Siao, Tat-Ming Lai, Bulat Ibragimov, Tomaž Vrtovec, Olaf Ronneberger, et al. *A benchmark for comparison of dental radiography analysis algorithms*. Medical Image Analysis, 31:63–76, 2016.

- For the **Hand X-ray Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Christian Payer, Darko Štern, Horst Bischof, and Martin Urschler. *Integrating spatial configuration into heatmap regression based CNNs for landmark localization*. Medical Image Analysis, 54:207–219, 2019.

- For the **H&N 3D Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Wenhui Lei, Wei Xu, Ran Gu, Hao Fu, Shaoting Zhang, Shichuan Zhang, and Guotai Wang. *Contrastive learning of relative position regression for one-shot object localization in 3D medical images*. In International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer-Assisted Intervention, pages 155–165. Springer, 2021.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
