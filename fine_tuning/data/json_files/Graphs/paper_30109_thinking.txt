To extract datasets from the research paper titled "TaCo: Textual Attribute Recognition via Contrastive Learning" by Chang Nie et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract hints at the construction of a large-scale synthetic dataset for pre-training and a validation dataset, which suggests that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically looking for any explicit mentions of datasets. In this section, the authors state that they constructed a large-scale synthetic dataset called **SynAttr**, which comprises one million images of text segments for system pre-training and fine-tuning. They also mention a validation dataset called **Attr-5k**, which consists of 5,000 images of text segments collected from real-world document scenes.

I will then look for detailed descriptions of these datasets in the **appendix**. The appendix provides the following information:

1. **SynAttr**: This dataset contains one million synthetic images of text segments, with each sample labeled with a bounding box and six attributes: font, color, italics, bold, underline, and strike. The dataset is designed for character-level attribute detection.

2. **Attr-5k**: This dataset includes 5,000 images of text segments gathered from various real-world document scenes, annotated with contents, bounding boxes, and textual attribute labels. It aims to validate the performance of attribute recognition approaches.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to retrieve full citations for these datasets. However, since these datasets are newly introduced in this paper and do not have separate publications, I will note that the citations will refer back to this paper itself.

The citations for the datasets will be as follows:

- For **SynAttr**:
  > Chang Nie, Yiqing Hu, Yanqiu Qu, Hao Liu, Deqiang Jiang, Bo Ren. *TaCo: Textual Attribute Recognition via Contrastive Learning*. In Proceedings of the [Conference Name], [Year].

- For **Attr-5k**:
  > Chang Nie, Yiqing Hu, Yanqiu Qu, Hao Liu, Deqiang Jiang, Bo Ren. *TaCo: Textual Attribute Recognition via Contrastive Learning*. In Proceedings of the [Conference Name], [Year].

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and citations, ensuring that all necessary information is clearly presented for further use or analysis.
