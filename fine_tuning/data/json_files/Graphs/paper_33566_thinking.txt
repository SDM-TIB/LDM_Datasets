To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Contrastive Learning with Negative Sampling Correction" by Lu Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will look for any references to datasets used for evaluation or experimentation.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, I will look for any specific dataset names, descriptions, and relevant details such as the number of samples, classes, or any unique characteristics that are highlighted.

In the **dataset description part of the experiments section**, I will identify the datasets mentioned. The paper states that they evaluate their method on several datasets for image representation learning and graph representation learning. Specifically, I will look for:

1. **CIFAR10**: A dataset consisting of 60,000 images across 10 classes.
2. **CIFAR100**: Similar to CIFAR10 but with 100 classes.
3. **STL10**: A dataset with 5,000 labeled images and 100,000 unlabeled images for unsupervised learning.
4. **PTC**: A dataset used for graph representation learning.
5. **ENZYMES**: Another dataset for graph classification tasks.
6. **DD**: A dataset used in graph representation learning.
7. **REDDIT-BINARY**: A binary classification dataset for graph representation.

After identifying these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets.

The citations I will look for include:

- For **CIFAR10** and **CIFAR100**, the citation is:
  > Krizhevsky, A., Hinton, G., et al. (2009). *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*.

- For **STL10**, the citation is:
  > Coates, A., Ng, A., & Lee, H. (2011). *An analysis of single-layer networks in unsupervised feature learning*. In Proceedings of AISTATS 2011, 215â€“223.

- For **PTC**, **ENZYMES**, **DD**, and **REDDIT-BINARY**, the citation is:
  > Morris, C., Kriege, N. M., Bause, F., Kersting, K., Mutzel, P., & Neumann, M. (2020). *TUDataset: A collection of benchmark datasets for learning with graphs*. arXiv preprint.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, facilitating further exploration and validation of the findings presented by the authors.
