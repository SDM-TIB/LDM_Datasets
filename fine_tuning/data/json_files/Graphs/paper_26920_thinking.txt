To extract datasets from the research paper titled "i-MIX: A Domain-Agnostic Strategy for Contrastive Representation Learning" by Kibok Lee et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the datasets that may be referenced. The abstract mentions that the authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their method across various domains, including image, speech, and tabular data. This suggests that multiple datasets might be involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4), as this is where datasets are typically detailed. In **Section 4.1 (Experimental Setup)**, the authors list several datasets used for their experiments:

1. **CIFAR-10**: A well-known dataset consisting of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class.
2. **CIFAR-100**: Similar to CIFAR-10 but with 100 classes, each containing 600 images.
3. **ImageNet**: A large-scale dataset with over 1.3 million images across 1,000 classes, commonly used for image classification tasks.
4. **Speech Commands Dataset**: Contains 51,000 training samples for limited-vocabulary speech recognition tasks.
5. **CovType**: A tabular dataset from the UCI repository, used for predicting forest cover types.
6. **Higgs Boson Dataset**: Another tabular dataset from the UCI repository, used for binary classification tasks.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for the datasets used in the experiments.

- For **CIFAR-10** and **CIFAR-100**, the citation is:
  > Krizhevsky, A., & Hinton, G. (2009). Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images. Technical report, University of Toronto.

- For **ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Deng, J., Dong, W., Socher, R., Li, J., Li, K., & Fei-Fei, L. (2009). ImageNet: A large-scale hierarchical image database. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 248â€“255.

- For the **Speech Commands Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Warden, P. (2018). Speech commands: A dataset for limited-vocabulary speech recognition. arXiv preprint arXiv:1804.03209.

- For **CovType**, the citation is:
  > Asuncion, A., & Newman, D. (2007). UCI machine learning repository.

- For **Higgs Boson Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Asuncion, A., & Newman, D. (2007). UCI machine learning repository.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
