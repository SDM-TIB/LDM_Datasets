To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards a Generic Representation of Combinatorial Problems for Learning-Based Approaches" by Léo Boisvert et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the research, which may include references to datasets used for experiments.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on experiments** or **datasets**. In this paper, the authors describe their experimental setup in **section 4 (Experiments)**, where they evaluate their approach on four combinatorial problems. This section is likely to contain specific details about the datasets used.

In **section 4**, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **Boolean Satisfiability (SAT)**: The instances are generated using the random generator of Selsam et al. (2018). The dataset contains millions of instances with 10 to 40 literals, with a training set of size 3,980,000 and a validation set of size 20,000.

2. **Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP)**: Instances are generated with the random generator of Prates et al. (2018). The dataset includes a training set of size 850,000 and a validation set of size 50,000, with cities sampled uniformly from 20 to 40.

3. **Graph Coloring (COL)**: Instances are generated following Lemos et al. (2019). The dataset consists of a training set of size 140,000 and a validation set of size 10,000.

4. **Knapsack (KNAP)**: Instances are created with 20 to 40 items, resulting in a training set of size 950,000 and a validation set of size 50,000.

Now, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

- For the **SAT dataset**, the citation is:

- For the **TSP dataset**, the citation is:

- For the **Graph Coloring dataset**, the citation is:

- For the **Knapsack dataset**, the citation is:
  > Liu, M., Zhang, F., Huang, P., Niu, S., Ma, F., & Zhang, J. (2020). *Learning the satisfiability of pseudo-Boolean problem with graph neural networks*. In Principles and Practice of Constraint Programming: 26th International Conference, CP 2020.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited, ready for structured output or further processing.
