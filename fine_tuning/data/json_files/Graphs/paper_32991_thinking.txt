To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SSLCL: An Efficient Model-Agnostic Supervised Contrastive Learning Framework for Emotion Recognition in Conversations" by Tao Shi et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on two ERC benchmark datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental settings section**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this case, they mention two datasets:

1. **IEMOCAP**: The IEMOCAP dataset is described as consisting of around 12 hours of dyadic conversation videos, divided into 151 dialogues with a total of 7433 individual utterances. Each utterance is annotated with one of six emotion labels: happy, sad, neutral, angry, excited, and frustrated.

2. **MELD**: The MELD dataset is described as a collection of multi-party conversations extracted from the TV series Friends, consisting of 1433 dialogues and a total of 13708 individual utterances. Each utterance is annotated with one of seven emotion categories: angry, disgust, fear, joy, neutral, sad, and surprise.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **IEMOCAP**, the citation is:
  > Busso, C.; Bulut, M.; Lee, C.-C.; Kazemzadeh, A.; Mower, E.; Kim, S.; Chang, J. N.; Lee, S.; and Narayanan, S. S. (2008). IEMOCAP: Interactive emotional dyadic motion capture database. *Language resources and evaluation*, 42: 335–359.

- For **MELD**, the citation is:
  > Poria, S.; Hazarika, D.; Majumder, N.; Naik, G.; Cambria, E.; and Mihalcea, R. (2019). MELD: A Multimodal Multi-Party Dataset for Emotion Recognition in Conversations. In *Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics*, 527–536.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
