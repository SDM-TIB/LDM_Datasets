To extract datasets from the research paper titled "OntoProtein: Protein Pretraining with Gene Ontology Embedding" by Jiazhang Lian et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors constructed a large-scale knowledge graph, which suggests that there may be a dataset associated with this graph.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for any explicit mentions of datasets. The introduction discusses the integration of Gene Ontology (GO) into protein pre-training, which may imply the existence of datasets related to GO.

Moving on to the **methodology** section, particularly the subsection titled **3.1 Datasets**, I will look for detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the study. Here, the authors mention two key datasets:

1. **ProteinKG25**: This is described as a large-scale knowledge graph dataset that includes 4,990,097 triples, consisting of both Protein-GO and GO-GO relationships. The dataset is constructed to facilitate protein pre-training and is aligned with Gene Ontology terms.

2. **TAPE Benchmark**: This dataset is used for evaluating protein representation learning. It includes various tasks such as secondary structure prediction, contact prediction, and protein-protein interaction prediction. The authors mention that they selected six representative datasets from TAPE for their experiments.

Next, I will check the **experiments** section to confirm the use of these datasets in the evaluations and to gather any additional details about their structure or usage.

Finally, I will refer to the **references** section to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. For the ProteinKG25 dataset, I will cite the paper itself as it is a newly constructed dataset. For the TAPE benchmark, I will look for the original paper that introduced this benchmark.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include full citations for each dataset as required.

Now, I will summarize the findings:

1. **Dataset Name**: ProteinKG25
   - **Description**: A large-scale knowledge graph dataset with 4,990,097 triples, facilitating protein pre-training.
   - **Citation**: Lian, J., Chen, H., Zhang, N., Bi, Z., Liang, X., Cheng, S., Hong, H., Deng, S., & Zhang, Q. (2022). OntoProtein: Protein Pretraining with Gene Ontology Embedding. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR).

2. **Dataset Name**: TAPE Benchmark
   - **Description**: A benchmark for evaluating protein representation learning, including various tasks such as secondary structure prediction and protein-protein interaction prediction.
   - **Citation**: Rao, R., Bhattacharya, N., Thomas, N., Duan, Y., Chen, X., Canny, J. F., Abbeel, P., & Rives, A. (2019). Evaluating Protein Transfer Learning with TAPE. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS).

With this structured approach, I will ensure that all relevant datasets are accurately documented with their respective citations.
