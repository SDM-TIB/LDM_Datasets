To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Marginal Contrastive Correspondence for Guided Image Generation" by Fangneng Zhan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses exemplar-based image translation and mentions that quantitative and qualitative experiments were conducted on various image translation tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will look into **section 4.1 (Experimental Settings)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, I find three datasets mentioned:

1. **ADE20K**: This dataset consists of 20,210 training images associated with a 150-class segmentation mask. It is used for semantic segmentation tasks in the experiments.

2. **CelebA-HQ**: This dataset contains 30,000 high-quality face images. The experiments utilize face edge maps as conditional inputs.

3. **DeepFashion**: This dataset includes 52,712 high-quality images of people in fashion clothing. The experiments are conducted using human key-points as conditional inputs.

To confirm the details and obtain the full citations for these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **ADE20K**, the citation is:
  > Bolei Zhou, Hang Zhao, Xavier Puig, Sanja Fidler, Adela Barriuso, and Antonio Torralba. *Scene parsing through ADE20K dataset*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 633–641, 2017.

- For **CelebA-HQ**, the citation is:
  > Ziwei Liu, Ping Luo, Xiaogang Wang, and Xiaoou Tang. *Deep learning face attributes in the wild*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision, pages 3730–3738, 2015.

- For **DeepFashion**, the citation is:
  > Ziwei Liu, Ping Luo, Shi Qiu, Xiaogang Wang, and Xiaoou Tang. *DeepFashion: Powering robust clothes recognition and retrieval with rich annotations*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 1096–1104, 2016.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their full citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured all necessary details regarding the datasets used in the research.
