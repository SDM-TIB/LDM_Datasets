To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Relational Self-supervised Distillation with Compact Descriptors for Image Copy Detection" by Juntae Kim et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract indicates that the authors propose a method for image copy detection and mentions the use of the **DISC2021 benchmark**, which suggests that this is a dataset of interest.

Next, I will look into **section 4.1 (Dataset)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used in their experiments. Here, I will find the following datasets:

1. **DISC2021**: This dataset is used for the Image Similarity Challenge and consists of training, reference, and query images. It is specifically designed for evaluating image copy detection methods.

2. **Copydays**: This dataset is designed to detect copied content and includes 157 original images along with 2,000 queries that have undergone various transformations such as cropping and JPEG compression.

3. **NDEC**: This dataset incorporates hard negative distractors and is derived from the DISC2021 dataset. It includes 900,000 basic images and 100,000 pairs of hard negative images, making it a more challenging dataset for image copy detection.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with sources for further exploration.

The full citations I will extract are:

- For **DISC2021**:
  > Matthijs Douze, Giorgos Tolias, Ed Pizzi, Zoë Papakipos, Lowik Chanussot, Filip Radenovic, Tomas Jenicek, Maxim Maximov, Laura Leal-Taixé, Ismail Elezi, et al. *The 2021 image similarity dataset and challenge*. arXiv:2106.09672, 2021.

- For **Copydays**:
  > Ed Pizzi, Sreya Dutta Roy, Sugosh Nagavara Ravindra, Priya Goyal, and Matthijs Douze. *A self-supervised descriptor for image copy detection*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 14532–14542, 2022.

- For **NDEC**:
  > Wenhao Wang, Yifan Sun, and Yi Yang. *A benchmark and asymmetrical-similarity learning for practical image copy detection*. 2023.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured all necessary details regarding the datasets used in the research paper.
