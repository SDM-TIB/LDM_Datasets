To extract datasets from the research paper titled "TuckER: Tensor Factorization for Knowledge Graph Completion" by Ivana Balaˇzevi´c et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract states that TuckER outperforms previous models across standard link prediction datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be discussed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 6 (Experiments and Results)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they list four datasets:

1. **FB15k**: A subset of Freebase, which is a large database of real-world facts.
2. **FB15k-237**: Created from FB15k by removing inverse relations from the validation and test sets, making it more challenging for models.
3. **WN18**: A subset of WordNet, which contains lexical relations between words.
4. **WN18RR**: A subset of WN18, created by removing inverse relations from validation and test sets.

I will also check the **table 2** in section 6, which provides statistics about these datasets, confirming their relevance and details such as the number of entities and relations.

Next, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **FB15k**, the citation is:
  > Antoine Bordes, Nicolas Usunier, Alberto Garcia-Duran, Jason Weston, and Oksana Yakhnenko. *Translating Embeddings for Modeling Multi-relational Data*. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 2013.

- For **FB15k-237**, the citation is:
  > Kristina Toutanova, Danqi Chen, Patrick Pantel, Hoi-fung Poon, Pallavi Choudhury, and Michael Gamon. *Representing Text for Joint Embedding of Text and Knowledge Bases*. In Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, 2015.

- For **WN18**, the citation is:
  > Antoine Bordes, Nicolas Usunier, Alberto Garcia-Duran, Jason Weston, and Oksana Yakhnenko. *Translating Embeddings for Modeling Multi-relational Data*. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 2013.

- For **WN18RR**, the citation is:
  > Tim Dettmers, Pasquale Minervini, Pontus Stenetorp, and Sebastian Riedel. *Convolutional 2D Knowledge Graph Embeddings*. In Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence, 2018.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described with its corresponding citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
