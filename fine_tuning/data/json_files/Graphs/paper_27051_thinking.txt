To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Recalibration of Neural Networks for Point Cloud Analysis" by Ignacio Sarasua et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the evaluation of their proposed methods on two tasks: object classification on ModelNet40 and object part segmentation on ShapeNet. This indicates that these datasets are likely to be detailed further in the paper.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. In section 4.1.1, the authors describe the **ModelNet40 dataset**, which contains 12,311 meshed CAD models from 40 categories, with 9,843 models for training and 2,468 for testing. This dataset is crucial for their object classification experiments.

Then, I will check section 4.1.2, where the authors discuss the **ShapeNet dataset**. They mention that this dataset contains 16,881 3D shapes used for object part segmentation. This is another important dataset that needs to be documented.

In section 4.2, the authors refer to the **Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI)** dataset, which is used for diagnosing Alzheimer’s disease. They describe how they processed the data from this initiative, focusing on the left hippocampus and sampling 1,500 points from the segmented structure.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset from the **References section** of the paper:

1. For **ModelNet40**, the citation is:
   > Wu, Z., Song, S., Khosla, A., Yu, F., Zhang, L., Tang, X., & Xiao, J. (2015). *3D ShapeNets: A Deep Representation for Volumetric Shapes*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2015.

2. For **ShapeNet**, the citation is:
   > Yi, L., Kim, V. G., Ceylan, D., Shen, I.-C., Yan, M., Su, H., Lu, C., Huang, Q., Sheffer, A., & Guibas, L. (2016). *A Scalable Active Framework for Region Annotation in 3D Shape Collections*. ACM Transactions on Graphics (TOG), 35(6), 1-12.

3. For **ADNI**, the citation is:
   > Jack, C. R., Bernstein, M. A., Fox, N. C., Thompson, P. M., Alexander, G., Harvey, D., Borowski, B., Britson, P. J., Whitwell, J. L., Ward, C., et al. (2008). *The Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI): MRI Methods*. Journal of Magnetic Resonance Imaging, 27(4), 685-691.

After compiling this information, I will ensure that each dataset is clearly described, including its purpose and the context in which it was used in the experiments. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper, along with their proper citations.
