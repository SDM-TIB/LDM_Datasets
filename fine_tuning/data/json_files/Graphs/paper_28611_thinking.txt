To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Network In Graph Neural Network" by Xiang Song et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on various large-scale graph datasets, which indicates that datasets are likely discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, specifically **subsection 4.1 (Evaluation Setup)**, where the authors list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention seven datasets, which are categorized into two tasks: node classification and link prediction.

The datasets identified are:

1. **ogbn-products**: This dataset is used for node classification and contains 2,449,029 nodes and 61,859,140 edges.
2. **ogbn-arxiv**: Another node classification dataset with 169,343 nodes and 1,166,243 edges.
3. **ogbn-proteins**: This dataset has 132,524 nodes and 39,561,252 edges, also for node classification.
4. **reddit**: A dataset for node classification with 232,965 nodes and 114,615,892 edges.
5. **ogbl-collab**: Used for link prediction, it has 235,868 nodes and 1,285,465 edges.
6. **ogbl-ppa**: Another link prediction dataset with 576,289 nodes and 30,326,273 edges.
7. **ogbl-ddi**: This dataset contains 4,267 nodes and 1,334,889 edges, also for link prediction.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The paper cites the Open Graph Benchmark (OGB) for the datasets used, which is a comprehensive source for graph datasets.

The full citation for the OGB datasets is:
> Weihua Hu, Matthias Fey, Marinka Zitnik, Yuxiao Dong, Hongyu Ren, Bowen Liu, Michele Catasta, and Jure Leskovec. *Open Graph Benchmark: Datasets for Machine Learning on Graphs*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2005.00687, 2020.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citation for the OGB datasets, which encompasses all the datasets mentioned in the paper.

In summary, I will document the datasets as follows:
1. ogbn-products
2. ogbn-arxiv
3. ogbn-proteins
4. reddit
5. ogbl-collab
6. ogbl-ppa
7. ogbl-ddi

Each dataset will be associated with the citation for the Open Graph Benchmark, as it serves as the authoritative source for these datasets.
