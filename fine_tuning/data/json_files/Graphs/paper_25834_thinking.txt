To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Watch Your Step: Learning Node Embeddings via Graph Attention" by Sami Abu-El-Haija et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions, and the introduction typically outlines the context and significance of the work, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe their experimental setup. In this section, they mention the datasets used for evaluation. Specifically, I will look for a table or a list that summarizes the datasets, including their characteristics such as the number of nodes and edges.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that **Table 1a** lists several datasets used in the experiments:

1. **wiki-vote**: A dataset with 7,066 nodes (users) and 103,663 edges (votes).
2. **ego-Facebook**: A dataset with 4,039 nodes (users) and 88,234 edges (friendship).
3. **ca-AstroPh**: A dataset with 17,903 nodes (researchers) and 197,031 edges (co-authorship).
4. **ca-HepTh**: A dataset with 8,638 nodes (researchers) and 24,827 edges (co-authorship).
5. **PPI**: A dataset with 3,852 nodes (proteins) and 20,881 edges (chemical interaction).

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. The paper mentions that the datasets are available from SNAP (Stanford Network Analysis Project), which is a common repository for such datasets. I will note that while the paper does not provide specific citations for each dataset, I can reference the SNAP repository as the source.

The citation for the SNAP repository is:
> Leskovec, J., & Krevl, A. (2014). *Snap: Stanford large network dataset collection*. Available at: http://snap.stanford.edu/data.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its citation.

In summary, I have identified the datasets used in the experiments and noted their characteristics. I have also found the appropriate citation for the source of these datasets. This process ensures that I have accurately extracted the necessary information for each dataset mentioned in the paper.
