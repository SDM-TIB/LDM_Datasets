To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Accurate Prediction of Free Solvation Energy of Organic Molecules via Graph Attention Network and Message Passing Neural Network from Pairwise Atomistic Interactions" by Ramin Ansari and Amirata Ghorbani, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's goals and methods, which may hint at the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of predicting solvation free energy and mention the use of machine learning models. However, I need to look for specific datasets in the subsequent sections.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly **section 3.1**, where the authors describe their computational setup and results. Here, they mention that they collected **5,952 data points for non-aqueous solvents** from the **Solv@TUM database version 1.0**. This dataset is crucial for their study, as it contains experimentally measured partition coefficients for various molecular solutes in non-aqueous solvents.

The authors provide additional details about the dataset, including the number of unique organic solvents (657) and unique organic solutes (146). They also explain how the partition coefficients were converted to solvation free energies in kcal/mol and how the SMILES representation of solute-solvent pairs was prepared for machine learning input.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Solv@TUM database. The authors reference it as follows:

- **Solv@TUM database version 1.0**:
  > Christoph Hille, Stefan Ringe, Martin Deimel, Christian Kunkel, William E Acree, Karsten Reuter, and Harald Oberhofer. *Generalized molecular solvation in non-aqueous solutions by a single parameter implicit solvation scheme*. The Journal of Chemical Physics, 150(4):041710, 2019.

With this information, I can summarize the dataset extracted from the paper:

1. **Solv@TUM Database**: Contains 5,952 data points for non-aqueous solvents, including partition coefficients and solvation free energies.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format for further processing, ensuring that the full citation is included for proper attribution.
