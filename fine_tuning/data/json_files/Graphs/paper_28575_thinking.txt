To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning to Evolve on Dynamic Graphs" by Xintao Xiang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on various datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experiment)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they list seven publicly available datasets, providing brief descriptions for each. I will carefully note down the names and descriptions of these datasets.

The datasets mentioned are:

1. **Stochastic Block Model (SBM)**: A random graph model for simulating community structures and evolutions, generated by Pareja et al. (2020).
2. **Bitcoin OTC (BC-OTC)**: A network representing a platform where people trade Bitcoin, with edges indicating trust levels.
3. **Bitcoin Alpha (BC-Alpha)**: Similar to BC-OTC but for a different trading platform.
4. **UC Irvine Messages (UCI)**: A social network of students at the University of California, with edges representing messages sent.
5. **Autonomous Systems (AS)**: A communication network where routers exchange traffic flows.
6. **Reddit Hyperlink Network**: Represents links from one post in a source community to another post in a target community.
7. **Brain**: A network where nodes represent brain tissue cubes and edges indicate connectivity.

After identifying the datasets, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and will be formatted as follows:

- For **Stochastic Block Model**, the citation is:
  > Pareja, A., Domeniconi, G., Chen, J., et al. *EvolveGCN: Evolving Graph Convolutional Networks for Dynamic Graphs*. In AAAI, 2020.

- For **Bitcoin OTC**, the citation is:
  > SNAP. *Bitcoin OTC*. Available at: http://snap.stanford.edu/data/soc-sign-bitcoin-otc.html.

- For **Bitcoin Alpha**, the citation is:

- For **Autonomous Systems**, the citation is:
  > SNAP. *Autonomous Systems*. Available at: http://snap.stanford.edu/data/as-733.html.

- For **Reddit Hyperlink Network**, the citation is:
  > SNAP. *Reddit Hyperlink Network*. Available at: http://snap.stanford.edu/data/soc-RedditHyperlinks.html.

- For **Brain**, the citation is:
  > Xu, D., Cheng, W., Luo, D., et al. *Adaptive Neural Network for Node Classification in Dynamic Networks*. In ICDM, 2019. Available at: https://tinyurl.com/y6d74mmv.

Finally, I will compile all the dataset information along with their citations into a structured format for easy reference and further processing. This ensures that I have accurately captured all necessary details from the paper regarding the datasets used in the research.
