To extract datasets from the research paper titled "HyperGCN: A New Method of Training Graph Convolutional Networks on Hypergraphs" by Naganand Yadati et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may highlight key datasets used for experimentation.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, I will look for any tables or descriptions that list the datasets, their characteristics, and their relevance to the study.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that **Table 3** in section 5 provides a summary of the real-world hypergraph datasets used in the experiments. The datasets listed are:

1. **DBLP (Co-authorship)**: This dataset consists of 43,413 hypernodes (authors) and 22,535 hyperedges (papers). It has an average hyperedge size of 4.7, 1,425 features, and 6 classes with a label rate of 0.040.

2. **Pubmed (Co-citation)**: This dataset contains 19,717 hypernodes and 7,963 hyperedges, with an average hyperedge size of 4.3, 500 features, and 3 classes, resulting in a label rate of 0.008.

3. **Cora (Co-authorship)**: This dataset has 2,708 hypernodes and 1,072 hyperedges, with an average hyperedge size of 4.2, 1,433 features, and 7 classes, leading to a label rate of 0.052.

4. **Cora (Co-citation)**: Similar to the previous Cora dataset, it has 2,708 hypernodes and 1,579 hyperedges, with an average hyperedge size of 3.0, 1,433 features, and 7 classes, with a label rate of 0.052.

5. **Citeseer (Co-citation)**: This dataset consists of 3,312 hypernodes and 1,079 hyperedges, with an average hyperedge size of 3.2, 3,703 features, and 6 classes, resulting in a label rate of 0.042.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The authors may have cited the original sources or papers where these datasets were introduced or described.

For the datasets, I will compile the following citations based on the information provided in the paper:

- **DBLP Dataset**: 
  > The DBLP dataset was constructed from Arnetminer. The authors manually curated the dataset from various computer science conference venues.

- **Pubmed Dataset**: 
  > The Pubmed dataset is derived from the Cora dataset, which is publicly available.

- **Cora Dataset**: 
  > The Cora dataset is a well-known dataset in the machine learning community, originally introduced in the paper by McCallum et al. (2000).

- **Citeseer Dataset**: 
  > The Citeseer dataset is also a widely used dataset in the literature, introduced in the paper by Lee et al. (2005).

Now, I will summarize the datasets and their citations in a structured format for clarity and future reference.
