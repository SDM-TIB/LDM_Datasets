To extract datasets from the research paper titled "GraphVQA: Language-Guided Graph Neural Networks for Scene Graph Question Answering" by Weixin Liang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors evaluate their method on the **GQA dataset**, which is a clear indication that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will look for specific details about the datasets in the **experiments section**. In this section, the authors mention that they evaluate their GraphVQA framework on the **GQA dataset** (Hudson and Manning, 2019a), which contains 110K scene graphs, 1.5M questions, and over 1000 different answer tokens. This provides a good overview of the dataset's scale and purpose.

I will also check the **dataset statistics** provided in the paper, which detail the number of graphs, nodes, edges, and types of attributes in the GQA dataset. This information is crucial for understanding the dataset's structure and usage.

In addition, I will look for any other datasets mentioned in the paper. The introduction references the **Visual Genome** dataset (Krishna et al., 2017a) as a source for generating scene graphs used in the GQA dataset. This indicates that Visual Genome is also relevant to the research.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

1. **GQA Dataset**:
   > Hudson, D. A., & Manning, C. D. (2019). GQA: A new dataset for real-world visual reasoning and compositional question answering. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 6700–6709.

2. **Visual Genome**:
   > Krishna, R., Zhu, Y., Groth, O., Johnson, J., Hata, K., Kravitz, J., Chen, S., Kalantidis, Y., Li, J.-L., Shamma, D. A., Bernstein, M. S., & Fei-Fei, L. (2017). Visual Genome: Connecting language and vision using crowdsourced dense image annotations. International Journal of Computer Vision, 123(1), 32–73.

After identifying the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their respective citations.
