To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Bi-Tuning of Pre-Trained Representations" by Jincheng Zhong et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted comprehensive experiments, which suggests that datasets are likely discussed in detail.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe their experimental setup. They mention using several datasets for fine-tuning their proposed Bi-tuning framework. Specifically, they refer to three fine-grained classification benchmarks: **CUB-200-2011**, **Stanford Cars**, and **FGVC Aircraft**. I will note down the details provided for each dataset.

1. **CUB-200-2011**: This dataset is mentioned as containing 11,788 images for 200 bird species. I will look for the full citation in the references section.

2. **Stanford Cars**: The authors state that this dataset contains 16,185 images of 196 classes of cars. I will also find its citation.

3. **FGVC Aircraft**: This dataset is described as containing 10,000 samples of 100 different aircraft variants. I will locate its citation as well.

Additionally, the authors mention constructing a large-scale dataset named **COCO-70** using annotations from the COCO dataset. This dataset contains 70 classes with more than 1,000 images per category. I will ensure to include its citation.

Now, I will check the **References section** of the paper to gather the full citations for each dataset:

- For **CUB-200-2011**, the citation is:
  > Welinder, P., Branson, S., Mita, T., Wah, C., Schroff, F., Belongie, S., & Perona, P. (2010). *Caltech-UCSD Birds 200*. Technical Report CNS-TR-2010-001, California Institute of Technology.

- For **Stanford Cars**, the citation is:
  > Krause, J., Stark, M., Deng, J., & Fei-Fei, L. (2013). *3D Object Representations for Fine-Grained Categorization*. In 3DRR.

- For **FGVC Aircraft**, the citation is:
  > Maji, S., Rahtu, E., Kannala, J., Blaschko, M., & Vedaldi, A. (2013). *Fine-Grained Visual Classification of Aircraft*. Technical report.

- For **COCO-70**, since it is constructed from the COCO dataset, I will cite the original COCO dataset:
  > Lin, T.-Y., Maire, M., Belongie, S., Hays, J., Perona, P., Ramanan, D., Doll√°r, P., & Zitnick, C. L. (2014). *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. In ECCV.

After gathering all the necessary information and citations, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
