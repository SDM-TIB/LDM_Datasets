To extract datasets from the research paper titled "From Real to Cloned Singer Identification" by Dorian Desblancs et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information and provide full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract hints at the use of two open datasets, the Free Music Archive (FMA) and MTG-Jamendo (MTG), as well as a closed dataset containing 176,141 songs spanning 7,500 popular singers. This indicates that multiple datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used. They mention that they collected data from four sources: Deezer, MusicBrainz, Wikidata, and Discogs, resulting in over four million tracks and 37,525 singers. The closed dataset is specifically noted to contain 176,141 songs from 7,500 popular singers, which is crucial for the study.

The authors also provide details about the two open datasets:
1. **Free Music Archive (FMA)**: The paper states that the FMA dataset was filtered to include only songs with vocal segments at least 50% of the time, resulting in 1,019 artists.
2. **MTG-Jamendo (MTG)**: Similar filtering was applied, leading to 572 artists.

Additionally, the authors mention a **cloned dataset** consisting of 377 tracks from YouTube featuring cloned voices of 67 singers from the closed dataset. This dataset is used to evaluate the models on music voice deepfakes.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

- For the **Free Music Archive (FMA)**, the citation is:
  > Defferrard, M., Benzi, K., Vandergheynst, P., & Bresson, X. (2017). *FMA: A dataset for music analysis*. In Proceedings of the International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR).

- For the **MTG-Jamendo (MTG)**, the citation is:
  > Bogdanov, D., Won, M., Tovstogan, P., Porter, A., & Serra, X. (2019). *The MTG-Jamendo dataset for automatic music tagging*. In Proceedings of the ICML Machine Learning for Music Discovery Workshop.

- The **closed dataset** is not attributed to a specific paper in the references, but it is described as containing 176,141 songs spanning 7,500 popular singers, collected from various sources.

- The **cloned dataset** is derived from YouTube and does not have a formal citation since it is a collection of tracks rather than a published dataset.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and includes its full citation for proper attribution. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the study.
