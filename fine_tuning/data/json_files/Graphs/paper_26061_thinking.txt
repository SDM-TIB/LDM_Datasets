To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Soft Marginal TransE for Scholarly Knowledge Graph Completion" by Mojtaba Nayyeri et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to find any references to datasets. The abstract discusses the use of a modified TransE model for link prediction tasks on scholarly metadata, which suggests that there may be a dataset involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Scholarly Knowledge Graphs)**, where the authors describe the creation of a scholarly knowledge graph. They mention that the knowledge graph is built from various sources of scholarly metadata, specifically citing DBLP, Springer Nature SciGraph Explorer, Semantic Scholar, and the Global Research Identifier Database (GRID). This indicates that these sources may contain datasets relevant to their research.

In **Table 1**, the authors provide statistics about the datasets used for training, validation, and testing. They mention the total number of triples for each dataset type, which is crucial information for understanding the datasets' structure and size. The datasets are categorized into three types: Training, Validation, and Test datasets, with specific counts for collaboration, publication, affiliation, and venue relationships.

Now, I will extract the relevant datasets and their details:

1. **Scholarly Knowledge Graph Dataset**: This dataset is created from various sources and contains 45,952 triples, which are split into training, validation, and test sets. The dataset includes entities such as papers, conferences, authors, and departments.

Next, I will look at the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The authors refer to the following sources for their scholarly knowledge graph:

- **DBLP**: 
  > DBLP Computer Science Bibliography. Available at: https://dblp2.uni-trier.de/

- **Springer Nature SciGraph Explorer**: 
  > Springer Nature SciGraph. Available at: https://springernature.com/scigraph

- **Semantic Scholar**: 
  > Semantic Scholar. Available at: https://semanticscholar.org

- **Global Research Identifier Database (GRID)**: 
  > GRID. Available at: https://www.grid.ac

These sources provide the foundational datasets for the scholarly knowledge graph used in the research.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and includes the full citation for each source. This will ensure that the datasets are properly documented for future reference or analysis.
