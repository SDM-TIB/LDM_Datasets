To extract datasets from the research paper titled "End-to-end Graph-constrained Vectorized Floorplan Generation with Panoptic Refinement" by Jiachen Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract states that the authors conducted extensive experiments on a real-world floorplan dataset, which indicates that a dataset is indeed involved.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors mention using the **RPLAN dataset** for their experiments. I will note down the details provided about this dataset, including its characteristics and any preprocessing steps mentioned.

In the **experiments section**, the authors describe the RPLAN dataset as providing vector-graphic floorplans from real-world residential buildings. They also reference the preprocessing pipeline used in their experiments, which is important for understanding how the dataset was utilized.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the RPLAN dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Wu, W., Fu, X. M., Tang, R., Wang, Y., Qi, Y. H., Liu, L. (2019). Data-driven interior plan generation for residential buildings. ACM Transactions on Graphics (TOG), 38(6), 1-12.

With this information, I will summarize the dataset details:

1. **RPLAN Dataset**: This dataset provides vector-graphic floorplans from real-world residential buildings. It is used for training and evaluating the proposed method in the paper.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry with the full citation into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured all necessary information regarding the datasets used in the research paper.
