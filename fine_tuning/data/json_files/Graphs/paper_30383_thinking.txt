To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Unsupervised Cross-Modality Domain Adaptation for Vestibular Schwannoma Segmentation and Koos Grade Prediction based on Semi-Supervised Contrastive Learning" by Luyi Han et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors developed a framework for segmentation and prediction tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experimental Results)**, where the authors discuss the datasets used for their experiments. They mention that the training dataset consists of 210 subjects with ceT1 images and another 210 subjects with hrT2 images, and the validation dataset includes 64 subjects with hrT2 images. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for their study.

The authors also reference the **Vestibular-Schwannoma-SEG collection**, which is available on The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA). This is an important dataset that I need to note.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. For the **Vestibular-Schwannoma-SEG collection**, the citation is:
   > Shapey, J., Kujawa, A., Dorent, R., Wang, G., Dimitriadis, A., Grishchuk, D., Paddick, I., Kitchen, N., Bradford, R., Saeed, S.R., et al. *Segmentation of vestibular schwannoma from MRI, an open annotated dataset and baseline algorithm*. Scientific Data, 8(1), 1â€“6, 2021.

I will also note that the authors used images from the CrossMoDA challenge, which is an extension of the publicly available dataset, but since the specific dataset name is not provided, I will focus on the main dataset mentioned.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations as required. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets utilized in the research.
