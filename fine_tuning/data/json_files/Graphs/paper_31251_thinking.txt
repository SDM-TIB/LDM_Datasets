To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Improving Contextual Spelling Correction by External Acoustics Attention and Semantic Aware Data Augmentation" by Xiaoqiang Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, but I need to look for specific mentions of datasets in the context of experiments or methodology.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss contextual biasing and mention various methods but do not specify datasets yet. I will continue to the **methodology section** where they describe the model architecture and training processes. Here, they mention using a small set and a large set of Microsoft in-house en-US data for training, but I need to confirm if these are formal datasets with citations.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**. The authors specify that the training set includes 0.2 thousand hours and 17K hours of Microsoft in-house data. They also mention a test set consisting of 12 Microsoft Teams meetings, which includes a name list of 600 person names. This is a significant detail as it indicates the datasets used for evaluation.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. However, the paper does not provide formal citations for the Microsoft in-house datasets, as they are proprietary. I will note that these datasets are not publicly available, which is important for anyone looking to replicate the study.

For the test set, while the authors mention the use of Microsoft Teams meetings, they do not provide a formal citation for this dataset either. It appears to be an internal dataset used for evaluation purposes.

In summary, I will document the datasets as follows:

1. **Microsoft In-House Data (Training Set)**: This dataset consists of 0.2K hours and 17K hours of en-US data used for training the model. However, no formal citation is available as it is proprietary.

2. **Microsoft Teams Meetings (Test Set)**: This dataset includes 12 meetings with a name list of 600 person names. Again, no formal citation is available as it is also proprietary.

I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity, ensuring to highlight the lack of formal citations for proprietary datasets.
