To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Watermarking Pre-trained Encoders in Contrastive Learning" by Yutong Wu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, and the introduction often highlights the datasets used for experiments.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Evaluation)**, where the authors describe their experimental setup. This section typically contains detailed information about the datasets used for training and testing the models. Here, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

In the evaluation section, the authors mention several datasets:

1. **CIFAR-10**: This dataset contains 60,000 images across 10 classes, with 50,000 samples for training and 10,000 for testing.

2. **ImageNet**: A large dataset with 14,000,000 images belonging to 1,000 classes, where each image has a size of 224 × 224 × 3.

3. **STL10**: This dataset consists of 113,000 images, including 5,000 labeled training images and 8,000 test images, along with 100,000 unlabeled images for unsupervised learning.

4. **GTSRB**: The German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark contains 51,800 images of 43 different traffic signs, with each image sized at 32 × 32 × 3.

5. **SVHN**: The Street View House Numbers dataset includes over 600,000 images of digit house numbers, divided into a training set of 73,257 images, a test set of 26,032 images, and an extra training set of 531,131 images.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets mentioned in the paper are as follows:

- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical Report, 2009.

- For **ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Olga Russakovsky, Jia Deng, Hao Sheng, et al. *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 115(3):211–252, 2015.

- For **STL10**, the citation is:
  > Adam Coates, Andrew Ng, and Honglak Lee. *An Analysis of Single-Layer Networks in Unsupervised Feature Learning*. In Proceedings of the AISTATS, 2011.

- For **GTSRB**, the citation is:
  > Benenson, R., Papageorgiou, A., & Schiele, B. *Pedestrian Detection at Night: A Benchmark*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2012.

- For **SVHN**, the citation is:
  > Yuval Netzer, Tao Wang, et al. *Reading Digits in Natural Images with Unsupervised Feature Learning*. In Proceedings of the Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS), 2011.

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this into a structured format for further processing or review.
