To extract datasets from the research paper titled "TATA: Stance Detection via Topic-Agnostic and Topic-Aware Embeddings" by Hans W. A. Hanley and Zakir Durumeric, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract indicates that the authors utilize an unlabeled dataset of news articles, which suggests that there are datasets relevant to their research.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Topic-Aware/TAW Dataset)**, where the authors describe the creation of a new dataset for training topic-aware embeddings. They mention that this dataset consists of quadruplets of passages, topics, paraphrases, and semantically similar passages. This section provides specific details about the dataset's structure and purpose.

In **section 4 (Augmented VAST Dataset)**, the authors discuss augmenting the existing VAST dataset to create a larger dataset for training topic-agnostic embeddings. They provide details about the original VAST dataset and how they extended it with paraphrased passages and topics.

Now, I will gather the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. **Unlabeled Dataset of News Articles**: This dataset is referenced as being collected by Hanley and Durumeric (2023). The citation is:
   > Hans WA Hanley and Zakir Durumeric. *Machine-made media: Monitoring the mobilization of machine-generated articles on misinformation and mainstream news websites*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2305.09820, 2023.

2. **VAST Dataset**: The original VAST dataset is referenced in the context of stance detection. The citation is:
   > Emily Allaway and Kathleen McKeown. *Zero-Shot Stance Detection: A Dataset and Model using Generalized Topic Representations*. In Proceedings of the 2020 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), pages 8913–8931, 2020.

3. **SEM16t6 Dataset**: This dataset is mentioned in the context of evaluating the model's performance. The citation is:
   > Saif Mohammad, Svetlana Kiritchenko, Parinaz Sobhani, Xiaodan Zhu, and Colin Cherry. *SemEval-2016 task 6: Detecting stance in tweets*. In Proceedings of the 10th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval-2016), pages 31–41, 2016.

After identifying these datasets and their citations, I will compile the information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their respective citations.
