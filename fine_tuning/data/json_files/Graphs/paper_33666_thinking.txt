To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SimMMDG: A Simple and Effective Framework for Multi-modal Domain Generalization" by Hao Dong et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the datasets referenced. The abstract mentions that the authors demonstrate their framework on the **EPIC-Kitchens dataset** and a novel dataset called **Human-Animal-Cartoon (HAC)**. This indicates that these two datasets are crucial for the experiments.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (section 5) to find detailed descriptions of these datasets. In this section, the authors explicitly state that they use the **EPIC-Kitchens dataset** and introduce the **HAC dataset**. 

1. **EPIC-Kitchens Dataset**: The authors describe it as containing eight actions recorded in three different kitchens, forming three separate domains. This dataset is well-known in the domain of action recognition.

2. **HAC Dataset**: The authors provide a detailed description of this dataset, stating that it consists of seven actions performed by humans, animals, and cartoon figures, forming three different domains. They mention that they collected 3,381 video clips from the internet, with around 1,000 samples for each domain.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **EPIC-Kitchens dataset**, the citation is:
  > Dima Damen, Hazel Doughty, Giovanni Maria Farinella, Sanja Fidler, Antonino Furnari, Evangelos Kazakos, Davide Moltisanti, Jonathan Munro, Toby Perrett, Will Price, and Michael Wray. *Scaling egocentric vision: The epic-kitchens dataset*. In ECCV, 2018.

- For the **HAC dataset**, since it is introduced in this paper, I will cite it as follows:
  > Hao Dong, Ismail Nejjar, Han Sun, Eleni Chatzi, and Olga Fink. *Human-Animal-Cartoon (HAC) dataset*. In SimMMDG: A Simple and Effective Framework for Multi-modal Domain Generalization, 2023.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research.
