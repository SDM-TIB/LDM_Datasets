To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Improving the Modality Representation with Multi-View Contrastive Learning for Multimodal Sentiment Analysis" by Peipei Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract states that the authors conducted extensive experiments on three open datasets, which indicates that there are datasets to be found.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experiments)**, where the authors provide details about the datasets used. Here, they mention three datasets:

1. **CMU-MOSI**: This dataset contains 93 videos from YouTube segmented into 2,199 video clips. It is used for regression tasks in sentiment analysis.

2. **CMU-MOSEI**: This dataset collects 23,453 video clips from 1,000 speakers and 250 subjects, also used for regression tasks.

3. **CH-SIMS**: This dataset consists of 60 videos from movies, TV series, and variety shows, divided into 2,281 video clips. Each clip is annotated with three independent single-modal labels and one multi-modal label, and it includes both regression and classification tasks.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **CMU-MOSI**, the citation is:
  > Amir Zadeh, Rowan Zellers, Eli Pincus, and Louis-Philippe Morency. *MOSI: Multimodal Corpus of Sentiment Intensity and Subjectivity Analysis in Online Opinion Videos*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.06259, 2016.

- For **CMU-MOSEI**, the citation is:
  > AmirAli Bagher Zadeh, Paul Pu Liang, Soujanya Poria, and Erik Cambria. *Multimodal Language Analysis in the Wild: CMU-MOSEI Dataset and Interpretable Dynamic Fusion Graph*. In Proceedings of the 56th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers), 2018, pp. 2236–2246.

- For **CH-SIMS**, the citation is:
  > Wenmeng Yu, Hua Xu, Fanyang Meng, Yilin Zhu, and et al. *CH-SIMS: A Chinese Multimodal Sentiment Analysis Dataset with Fine-Grained Annotation of Modality*. In Proceedings of the 58th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, Online, July 2020, pp. 3718–3727.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
