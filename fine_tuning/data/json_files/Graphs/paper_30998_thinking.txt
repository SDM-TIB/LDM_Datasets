To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Machine Learning for Large-Scale Optimization in 6G Wireless Networks" by Yandong Shi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections. These sections often provide a summary of the methodologies and datasets used in the research. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or references to data sources.

Next, I will examine the **methodology and experiments sections**. These sections typically contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used for training and testing the models. I will pay close attention to any tables or figures that may summarize the datasets, as well as any specific dataset names mentioned in the text.

As I read through the paper, I will take note of any datasets that are referenced, including their names, sizes, and any relevant characteristics. If the authors provide specific details about the datasets, such as the number of samples, features, or the context in which they were used, I will document those as well.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** of the paper to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for ensuring that the datasets can be properly attributed and accessed by others. I will look for any papers or reports that describe the datasets in detail.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.

Finally, I will ensure that the information is organized clearly and accurately, ready for presentation or further analysis.
