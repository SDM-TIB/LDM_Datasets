To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Causal Graph ODE: Continuous Treatment Effect Modeling in Multi-agent Dynamical Systems" by Zijie Huang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on two datasets: **COVID-19** and **tumor growth**. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for understanding the model's performance and application.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **Datasets** section or any relevant subsections that provide detailed descriptions of these datasets. In this paper, the datasets are discussed in **section 5.1.1 (Datasets and Experiment Configuration)**. Here, the authors provide specific details about each dataset used in their experiments.

1. **COVID-19 Dataset**: The authors describe this dataset as capturing daily COVID-19 trends in U.S. states from April 12, 2020, to December 31, 2020. It includes various features such as daily counts of confirmed cases, deaths, and policies enacted to combat the spread of COVID-19. The dataset is sourced from the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center.

2. **Tumor Growth Dataset**: This dataset is based on a pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic model of tumor growth, specifically for patients with non-small cell lung cancer. The authors mention that they extended the original model to include interactions between multiple tumor regions and treatments. The original dataset is referenced as being from a study by Geng et al. (2017).

After identifying these datasets, I will proceed to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **COVID-19 dataset**, the citation is:
  > Johns Hopkins University. *COVID-19 Data Repository by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University*. Available at: https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html.

- For the **Tumor Growth dataset**, the citation is:
  > Changran Geng, Harald Paganetti, and Clemens Grassberger. *Prediction of treatment response for combined chemo-and radiation therapy for non-small cell lung cancer patients using a bio-mathematical model*. Scientific Reports, 7(1), 13542, 2017. DOI: 10.1038/s41598-017-13873-4.

Now that I have the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or analysis. This includes ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its citation, which is critical for proper attribution and reference in future work.
