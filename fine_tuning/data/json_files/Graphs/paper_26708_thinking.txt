To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The Expressive Power of Kth-Order Invariant Graph Networks" by Floris Geerts, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections that discuss experiments or methodology**. The abstract provides a concise overview of the paper's contributions, but it may not mention specific datasets. Therefore, I will focus on the **introduction** and any **dedicated sections** that discuss datasets or experiments.

In the **introduction**, I will look for any references to datasets used for evaluation or comparison. If the authors mention specific datasets or benchmarks, I will note their names and any relevant details provided.

Next, I will examine the **methodology or experiments section**. This section typically contains detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the experiments. I will look for any subsections explicitly labeled as "Datasets" or similar. Here, I will extract the names of the datasets, their descriptions, and any relevant statistics (e.g., number of samples, types of data).

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily. I will ensure that I capture the authors, title, publication venue, and any other relevant details for each dataset.

If the paper mentions datasets that are well-known or widely used in the field, I will cross-reference them with existing literature to confirm their citations. 

Finally, I will compile the extracted information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset entry includes:
1. The name of the dataset.
2. A brief description of the dataset.
3. The full citation for the dataset.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets referenced in the paper, maintaining a focus on clarity and completeness in the citations.
