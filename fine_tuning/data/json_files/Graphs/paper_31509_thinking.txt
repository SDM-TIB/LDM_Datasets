To extract datasets from the research paper titled "mSPD-NN: A Geometrically Aware Neural Framework for Biomarker Discovery from Functional Connectomics Manifolds" by Niharika S. Dâ€™Souza and Archana Venkataraman, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for experiments. In this case, the authors refer to experiments on **rs-fMRI data** and the **CNI 2019 Challenge dataset**, which indicates that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** to find detailed descriptions of the datasets. In section 3.2, the authors explicitly mention the **CNI 2019 Challenge dataset**, which consists of preprocessed rs-fMRI time series data for 158 subjects diagnosed with ADHD, 92 subjects with ASD, and 257 healthy controls. This section provides important details about the dataset, including the number of subjects and the context of the data collection.

I will also check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The authors reference the CNI 2019 Challenge dataset, and I will look for the corresponding citation in the references. The citation is as follows:
> Schirmer, M.D., et al. *Neuropsychiatric disease classification using functional connectomics-results of the connectomics in neuroimaging transfer learning challenge*. Medical image analysis 70, 101972 (2021).

Additionally, I will ensure that I capture any other datasets mentioned in the paper. In this case, the authors discuss the use of **rs-fMRI data**, but they do not provide a specific citation for this data source. Therefore, I will note that while the CNI 2019 Challenge dataset is explicitly cited, the rs-fMRI data is described in a general context without a specific reference.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citation for the CNI 2019 Challenge dataset. The final output will summarize the datasets extracted from the paper, ready for further processing or review.
