To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Cause and Effect: Can Large Language Models Truly Understand Causality?" by Swagata Ashwani et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions the introduction of a new dataset called **CausalNet**, which is a strong indicator that there are datasets to extract. The introduction further emphasizes the importance of evaluating the proposed framework on benchmark datasets, which suggests that multiple datasets may be referenced.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for training and evaluation. Here, the authors explicitly list six distinct datasets, detailing their composition and purpose:

1. **CLadder**: This dataset is derived from narrative texts and is used to identify explicit causal links within narratives. It serves as foundational training for the model's explicit causal reasoning abilities.

2. **Com2Sense**: Similar to CLadder, this dataset focuses on narrative structures and explicit causal statements, aiding in the model's understanding of causal relationships.

3. **TimeTravel**: This dataset presents hypothetical scenarios for counterfactual reasoning, enhancing the model's ability to contemplate different possibilities.

4. **COPA**: This dataset focuses on scenarios requiring an understanding of potential outcomes and alternate realities, contributing to causal discovery.

5. **e-care**: This dataset contains medical narratives that add domain-specific intricacies for causal discovery tasks.

6. **CausalNet**: A new dataset introduced by the authors, comprising 1000 curated scenarios designed for causal reasoning and counterfactual analysis.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to guide future researchers to the original sources.

The citations I will extract are as follows:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference and further analysis. This systematic approach ensures that I have accurately captured all relevant datasets and their citations from the paper.
