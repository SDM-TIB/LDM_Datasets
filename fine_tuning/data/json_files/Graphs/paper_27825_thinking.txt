To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Predicting Quantum Potentials by Deep Neural Network and Metropolis Sampling" by Rui Hong et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of a deep neural network combined with Metropolis sampling to predict quantum potentials, but it does not specify any datasets at this point.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any references to datasets. The introduction discusses the application of machine learning in quantum physics and mentions various works but does not provide specific dataset names.

I will then focus on the **methodology section** where the authors describe their approach in detail. Here, they mention that the data to train the neural network consists of multiple coordinates with labels as the expected values of the potential function. However, they do not specify any datasets by name.

Next, I will check the **numerical results section** to see if any datasets are referenced in the context of benchmarking their method. The authors mention benchmarking on the harmonic oscillator and hydrogen atom, but again, they do not provide specific datasets.

Finally, I will look at the **acknowledgments and references sections** to see if any datasets are cited there. The references include various papers related to machine learning and quantum physics, but they do not specifically mention datasets used in this study.

Since the paper does not explicitly mention any datasets by name or provide citations for them, I conclude that there are no specific datasets to extract from this paper. 

In summary, I will document that no datasets were identified in the paper "Predicting Quantum Potentials by Deep Neural Network and Metropolis Sampling" by Rui Hong et al. and provide a note indicating the absence of dataset citations.
