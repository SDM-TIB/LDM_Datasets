This dataset comprises speech recordings and their corresponding manual transcripts. Each participant describes the Cookie Theft picture from the Boston Diagnostic Aphasia Exam. The dataset minimizes the risks of biases in the prediction task, being matched for gender and age, and contains equal numbers of AD and non-AD patients. Recordings have been acoustically enhanced with stationary noise removal and audio volume normalization.",
