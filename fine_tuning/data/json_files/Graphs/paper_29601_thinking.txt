To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Optimizing Test-Time Query Representations for Dense Retrieval" by Mujeen Sung et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their method on multiple open-domain QA datasets, which indicates that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention six datasets:

1. **Natural Questions**: A dataset for open-domain question answering, which includes a variety of questions and their corresponding answers.
2. **TriviaQA**: A large-scale dataset for reading comprehension, consisting of question-answer pairs derived from trivia questions.
3. **WebQuestions**: A dataset that contains questions posed to a search engine, along with their corresponding answers from Freebase.
4. **CuratedTrec**: A dataset designed for evaluating question answering systems, containing a set of questions and their answers.
5. **SQuAD**: The Stanford Question Answering Dataset, which consists of questions based on a set of Wikipedia articles.
6. **EntityQuestions**: A dataset used for testing, which focuses on entity-centric questions.

In the **experiments section**, the authors confirm that they utilize these datasets for evaluating their proposed method, providing further validation of their relevance.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its full citation, ready for further processing or review.
