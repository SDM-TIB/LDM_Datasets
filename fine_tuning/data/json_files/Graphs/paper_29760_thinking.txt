To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ComENet: Towards Complete and Efficient Message Passing for 3D Molecular Graphs" by Limei Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. In the abstract, the authors mention that they applied their method to "two large-scale datasets including OC20 and Molecule3D, and a commonly used dataset QM9." This indicates that these datasets are significant for the research and should be detailed.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (Section 6) where the authors provide statistics about the datasets. They mention:

1. **Open Catalyst 2020 (OC20)**: This dataset contains 660,010 structures for the Initial Structure to Relaxed Energy (IS2RE) task. The paper states that it is a large-scale dataset with millions of DFT relaxations to model and discover catalysts.

2. **Molecule3D**: This dataset includes approximately 3,899,647 molecules with precise ground-state geometries derived from DFT. It is designed for predicting 3D geometries from molecular graphs.

3. **QM9**: This dataset is widely used for predicting various properties of molecules and includes geometric, energetic, electronic, and thermodynamic properties for 134k stable small organic molecules.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to guide readers to the original sources.

- For **Open Catalyst 2020 (OC20)**, the citation is:
  > Lowik Chanussot, Abhishek Das, Siddharth Goyal, Thibaut Lavril, Muhammed Shuaibi, Morgane Riviere, Kevin Tran, Javier Heras-Domingo, Caleb Ho, Weihua Hu, et al. *Open Catalyst 2020 (OC20) dataset and community challenges*. ACS Catalysis, 11(10):6059–6072, 2021.

- For **Molecule3D**, the citation is:
  > Zhao Xu, Youzhi Luo, Xuan Zhang, Xinyi Xu, Yaochen Xie, Meng Liu, Kaleb Dickerson, Cheng Deng, Maho Nakata, and Shuiwang Ji. *Molecule3D: A benchmark for predicting 3D geometries from molecular graphs*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2110.01717, 2021.

- For **QM9**, the citation is:
  > Raghunathan Ramakrishnan, Pavlo O Dral, Matthias Rupp, and O Anatole Von Lilienfeld. *Quantum chemistry structures and properties of 134 kilo molecules*. Scientific data, 1(1):1–7, 2014.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described clearly and that the full citations are included for reference. This structured approach will help in accurately documenting the datasets used in the research.
