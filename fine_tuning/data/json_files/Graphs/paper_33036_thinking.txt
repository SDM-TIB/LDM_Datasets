To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Compressed Learning for 3D Seismic Inversion" by Maayan Gelboim et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, results, and conclusion sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any references to datasets used for training or evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to see if the authors discuss any specific datasets that are critical for their research. The introduction often sets the context for the study and may mention datasets that are commonly used in the field.

In the **methods section**, I will look for any explicit mention of datasets, particularly in the context of the experiments conducted. This section may detail how the datasets were generated or sourced, which is crucial for understanding their relevance and application.

The **results section** may also provide insights into the datasets used, especially if the authors discuss the performance of their model on specific datasets or provide comparisons with existing methods.

Finally, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned in the paper. This is essential for proper attribution and for readers who may want to access the datasets themselves.

In this paper, the authors mention generating 2000 3D models for their experiments. They state that these models were created using the **Gempy** tool for 3D geological modeling. Therefore, I will note this as a dataset used in their study.

The citation for the Gempy tool is:
> M. Gelboim, A. Adler, Y. Sun, and M. Araya-Polo. *Encoderâ€“decoder architecture for 3D seismic inversion*. Sensors, vol. 23, no. 1, p. 61, 2022.

Additionally, the authors refer to the use of simulated seismic surveys based on an isotropic acoustic wave approximation, but they do not provide a specific dataset name for this simulation. Instead, they describe the methodology used to generate the data.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited according to the conventions used in academic writing. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research.
