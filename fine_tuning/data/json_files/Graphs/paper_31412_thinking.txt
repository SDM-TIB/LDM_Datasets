To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "SegPrompt: Using Segmentation Map as a Better Prompt to Finetune Deep Models for Kidney Stone Classification" by Wei Zhu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on a **collected kidney stone dataset**, which suggests that there is a specific dataset involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Dataset)**, where the authors provide details about the dataset they collected. They mention that they gathered **1496 kidney stone images from 5 different videos** and filtered out low-quality images, resulting in **867 images with COM (calcium oxalate monohydrate) stones** and **629 images with CAP (calcium phosphate) stones**. This section confirms the existence of a dataset used for their experiments.

I will also check the **References section** to find any citations related to the dataset. However, since the dataset is collected by the authors themselves, there may not be an external citation for it. Instead, I will note that the dataset is a custom collection made specifically for this study.

Now, I will summarize the dataset information:

1. **Kidney Stone Dataset**: This dataset consists of 1496 images collected from 5 different videos, specifically focusing on kidney stones. The dataset is divided into two categories based on stone composition: 867 images of COM stones and 629 images of CAP stones. The dataset was filtered to remove low-quality images.

Since this dataset is not published externally, I will not have a formal citation for it. However, I will note that it is a custom dataset created for the purpose of this research.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format that captures the essential details, ready for review or further processing.
