To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Knowledge Graph Self-Supervised Rationalization for Recommendation" by Yuhao Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments on three real-world datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors explicitly state the datasets used for their experiments. They mention three distinct datasets: 

1. **Last-FM**: This dataset is used for music recommendations and includes user-item interactions, knowledge entities, and relations.

2. **MIND**: This dataset is utilized for news recommendations and also contains user-item interactions along with knowledge graph information.

3. **Alibaba-iFashion**: This dataset is employed for shopping recommendations and includes similar structures as the other datasets.

In this section, the authors provide statistics for each dataset, including the number of users, items, interactions, entities, relations, and triplets. This detailed information is crucial for understanding the datasets' characteristics.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. However, since the datasets are commonly used in the field, they may not have specific citations provided in the references. Instead, I will summarize the information based on the context provided in the paper.

For the datasets, I will document the following:

1. **Last-FM Dataset**:
   - Description: A dataset for music recommendations.
   - Statistics: 
     - Users: 23,566
     - Items: 48,123
     - Interactions: 3,034,796
     - Density: 2.7e-3
     - Entities: 58,266
     - Relations: 9
     - Triplets: 464,567

2. **MIND Dataset**:
   - Description: A dataset for news recommendations.
   - Statistics:
     - Users: 100,000
     - Items: 30,577
     - Interactions: 2,975,319
     - Density: 9.7e-4
     - Entities: 24,733
     - Relations: 512
     - Triplets: 148,568

3. **Alibaba-iFashion Dataset**:
   - Description: A dataset for shopping recommendations.
   - Statistics:
     - Users: 114,737
     - Items: 30,040
     - Interactions: 1,781,093
     - Density: 5.2e-4
     - Entities: 59,156
     - Relations: 51
     - Triplets: 279,155

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the descriptions and statistics for each dataset. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, which is essential for understanding the context and applicability of the findings.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring that each dataset is clearly documented with its respective details.
