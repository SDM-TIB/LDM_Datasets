To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Tree-constrained Pointer Generator with Graph Neural Network Encodings for Contextual Speech Recognition" by Guangzhi Sun et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that experiments were conducted on the **Librispeech corpus** and the **AMI corpus**, which suggests that these are the datasets of interest.

Next, I will delve into **section 5 (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used:

1. **Librispeech Corpus**: This dataset consists of 960 hours of read English from audiobooks. It is mentioned that the dev sets were held out for validation, and test-clean and test-other sets were used for evaluation.

2. **AMI Meeting Corpus**: This corpus contains 100 hours of meeting recordings with 4-5 people. The authors specify that it was split into train, dev, and eval sets, and they used a subset of 10% of the utterances from the AMI train set for fine-tuning their models.

In the **References section**, I will look for full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Librispeech corpus**, the citation is:
  > V. Panayotov, G. Chen, D. Povey & S. Khudanpur. *Librispeech: An ASR corpus based on public domain audio books*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing (ICASSP), pages 5206–5210, 2015.

- For the **AMI Meeting Corpus**, the citation is:
  > J. Carletta, S. Ashby, S. Bourban, M. Flynn, M. Guillemot, T. Hain, J. Kadlec, V. Karaiskos, W. Kraaij, M. Kronenthal, G. Lathoud, M. Lincoln, A. Lisowska, I. McCowan, W. Post, D. Reidsma, & P. Wellner. *The AMI meeting corpus: A preannouncement*. In Proceedings of the Machine Learning for Multimodal Interaction (MLMI), pages 1–6, 2006.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will prepare to compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their respective citations.
