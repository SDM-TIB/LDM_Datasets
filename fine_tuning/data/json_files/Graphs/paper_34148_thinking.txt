To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CSEPrompts: A Benchmark of Introductory Computer Science Prompts" by Nishat Raihan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** sections to get an overview of the datasets being discussed. The abstract mentions the creation of **CSEPrompts**, which is a framework containing programming exercise prompts and multiple-choice questions (MCQs) collected from various sources. This indicates that there are datasets involved.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section (Section 3)**, where the authors describe the CSEPrompts framework in detail. Here, they mention that the framework consists of **219 programming prompts and 50 MCQs** collected from coding websites and MOOCs. I will look for specific names of the datasets or sources from which these prompts and questions were derived.

In **Table 1**, the authors list the coding websites and MOOCs used to compile the prompts. The coding websites include:

1. **CodingBat**
2. **Learn Python**
3. **Edabit**
4. **Python Principles**
5. **HackerRank**

For MOOCs, they mention courses from:

1. **Harvard CS50**
2. **Programming for Everybody (PforE)**
3. **University of Michigan**
4. **Georgia Tech (CS1301 series)**

I will note that the total number of prompts from coding websites is **118** and from MOOCs is **101**, with an additional **50 MCQs** collected from the MOOCs.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets or sources mentioned. The authors do not provide formal citations for the coding websites, but they do reference the MOOCs, which are part of established educational programs. 

For the MOOCs, I will cite them as follows:

- **Harvard CS50**: 
  > Harvard University. *CS50: Introduction to Computer Science*. Available at: https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:HarvardX+CS50S+Scratch/home

- **Programming for Everybody (PforE)**: 
  > University of Michigan. *Programming for Everybody (Getting Started with Python)*. Available at: https://www.coursera.org/learn/python/home

- **Georgia Tech Courses**: 
  > Georgia Institute of Technology. *CS1301: Introduction to Computing*. Available at: https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:GTx+CS1301xI+1T2023/home

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the names and descriptions of the datasets along with their citations. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
