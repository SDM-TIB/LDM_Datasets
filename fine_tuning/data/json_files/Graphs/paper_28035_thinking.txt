To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Token-Level Supervised Contrastive Learning for Punctuation Restoration" by Qiushi Huang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the need for punctuation restoration in automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems, which suggests that datasets related to this task may be discussed later in the paper. The introduction provides context about the challenges in punctuation restoration and hints at the use of specific datasets.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, as this section typically contains detailed information about the datasets used in the experiments. In **section 4.1 (Dataset)**, the authors explicitly mention the **IWSLT TED Talk dataset** as the dataset used for their punctuation restoration tasks. They provide details about the dataset, including the number of words in the training, validation, and test sets, as well as the distribution of punctuation labels.

The IWSLT TED Talk dataset is described as follows:
- It consists of 2.1 million words in the training set, 295,000 words in the validation set, and 12,600 words in the test set. Each word is labeled with one of four classes: O (No Punctuation), COMMA, PERIOD, and QUESTION. The authors also provide the distribution of these labels, indicating a significant class imbalance.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the IWSLT TED Talk dataset. The citation is as follows:
> X. Che, C. Wang, H. Yang, and C. Meinel. "Punctuation prediction for unsegmented transcript based on word vector." In LREC, 2016.

Having gathered all the necessary information, I will summarize the dataset details and ensure that the full citation is included for the IWSLT TED Talk dataset. This will allow for proper referencing and acknowledgment of the dataset used in the research.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format for clarity and future reference.
