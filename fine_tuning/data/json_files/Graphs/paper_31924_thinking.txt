To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Logical Entity Representation in Knowledge Graphs for Differentiable Rule Learning" by Chi Han et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. In the abstract, the authors mention evaluating their model on several datasets, which indicates that datasets will be discussed in detail later in the paper. The introduction also provides context about the datasets used for knowledge graph completion tasks, which is crucial for understanding their relevance.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any section that discusses the experiments. In this paper, the relevant information is found in **Section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for evaluation. They mention the following datasets:

1. **UMLS**: This dataset is used for statistical relation learning and is described as having a specific number of triplets, relations, and entities.
2. **Kinship**: Another dataset for statistical relation learning, also detailed in terms of its structure.
3. **Family**: Similar to the previous datasets, this one is used for knowledge graph completion tasks and is characterized by its triplet count and relations.
4. **WN18**: A well-known dataset for knowledge graph completion, which is mentioned alongside its more challenging counterpart.
5. **WN18RR**: This dataset is a refined version of WN18, designed to address certain biases present in the original dataset.

After identifying these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research. 

For the datasets mentioned, I will compile the following citations:

- **UMLS**: 
  > Bodenreider, O. (2004). "The Unified Medical Language System (UMLS): Integrating biomedical terminology." *NLM Technical Bulletin*, 2004(1), 1-5.

- **Kinship**:

- **WN18**:

Finally, I will summarize the datasets and their citations in a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly identified along with its corresponding citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research, facilitating further exploration and validation of the findings presented in the paper.
