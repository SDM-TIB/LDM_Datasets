To extract datasets from the research paper titled "GraphWalks: Efficient Shape Agnostic Geodesic Short Path Estimation" by Rolandos Alexandros Potamias et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research but may not specify datasets. The introduction often discusses the context and may reference datasets used in prior work or the current study.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for training and evaluation. In this section, I find that the authors mention utilizing the **TOSCA dataset**. They describe it as containing 80 unique shapes under different non-rigid transformations, which is relevant for their geodesic path modeling task.

I will then look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the TOSCA dataset. The paper cites the TOSCA dataset as follows:

- **TOSCA Dataset**: 
  > Alexander M. Bronstein, Michael M. Bronstein, and Ron Kimmel. *Numerical Geometry of Non-Rigid Shapes*. Springer Science & Business Media, 2008.

Since the TOSCA dataset is the only dataset explicitly mentioned in the paper, I will compile this information.

Finally, I will summarize the findings, ensuring to include the full citation for the dataset as it is crucial for proper attribution and further research.

In conclusion, I will prepare the dataset entry based on the information gathered, ensuring that it is clear and accurately reflects the content of the paper.
