To extract datasets from the research paper titled "2D Feature Distillation for Weakly- and Semi-Supervised 3D Semantic Segmentation" by Ozan Unal et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results on **ScribbleKITTI** and **SemanticKITTI**, indicating that these datasets are likely important for the research.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **introduction**. Here, the authors discuss the challenges of labeling LiDAR scenes and reference **ScribbleKITTI** as a benchmark for weakly supervised LiDAR semantic segmentation. They also mention **SemanticKITTI**, which is a well-known dataset for LiDAR semantic segmentation.

In the **experiments section**, the authors explicitly state that they run experiments on **ScribbleKITTI** and **SemanticKITTI**. They describe **ScribbleKITTI** as providing realistic weak labels for LiDAR semantic segmentation, built on **SemanticKITTI**, which shares the same valid set. This confirms that both datasets are utilized in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. **ScribbleKITTI**: The citation is:
   > Ozan Unal, Dengxin Dai, and Luc Van Gool. *Scribble-supervised LiDAR semantic segmentation*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 2697–2707, June 2022.

2. **SemanticKITTI**: The citation is:
   > Jens Behley, Martin Garbade, Andres Milioto, Jan Quenzel, Sven Behnke, Cyrill Stachniss, and Jurgen Gall. *SemanticKITTI: A dataset for semantic scene understanding of lidar sequences*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision, pages 9297–9307, 2019.

Having gathered the necessary information, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

- **ScribbleKITTI**: A dataset providing weak labels for LiDAR semantic segmentation, built on the SemanticKITTI dataset.
- **SemanticKITTI**: A large-scale dataset for semantic segmentation of LiDAR sequences.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries with their full citations for further processing.
