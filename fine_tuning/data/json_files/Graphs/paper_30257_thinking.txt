To extract datasets from the research paper titled "S3R: Self-supervised Spectral Regression for Hyperspectral Histopathology Image Classification" by Xingran Xie et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant details, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the need for annotated data in hyperspectral images, which suggests that datasets will be discussed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they describe two specific datasets:

1. **PDAC Dataset**: This dataset consists of 523 hyperspectral image scenes collected from 36 patients, with specific splits for training, validation, and testing. The authors provide details about the number of scenes belonging to pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and the spectral bands involved.

2. **PLGC Dataset**: This dataset includes 1105 hyperspectral image scenes related to intestinal metaplasia and dysplasia, with a similar split for training, validation, and testing. The authors also specify the number of cases for each category and the spectral bands.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For the **PDAC Dataset**, the citation is:
> Gullo, I., Grillo, F., Mastracci, L., Vanoli, A., Fassan, M. "Precancerous lesions of the stomach, gastric cancer and hereditary gastric cancer syndromes." *Pathologica*, 112(3), 166–185, 2020.

For the **PLGC Dataset**, the citation is:
> Zhao, Z., Wang, H., Yu, X. "Spectral-spatial graph attention network for semi-supervised hyperspectral image classification." *IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters*, 19, 1–5, 2022.

Now that I have the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their proper citations.
