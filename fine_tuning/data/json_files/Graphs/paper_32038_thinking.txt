To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Graph is Worth 1-Bit Spikes: When Graph Contrastive Learning Meets Spiking Neural Networks" by Jintang Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their method on several graph benchmarks, which indicates that datasets are involved. I will look for specific names of datasets in these sections.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this paper, they mention evaluating SPIKEGCL on **nine common benchmark graphs**, including:

1. **Amazon-Photo**: A co-purchase graph dataset.
2. **Amazon-Computer**: Another co-purchase graph dataset.
3. **Coauthor-CS**: A co-author graph dataset.
4. **Coauthor-Physics**: Another co-author graph dataset.
5. **Cora**: A citation graph dataset.
6. **CiteSeer**: Another citation graph dataset.
7. **PubMed**: A citation graph dataset.
8. **ogbn-arXiv**: A large-scale dataset from the Open Graph Benchmark.
9. **ogbn-MAG**: Another large-scale dataset from the Open Graph Benchmark.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are typically provided in the references, and I will ensure to include them accurately.

For example, the citations for the datasets might look like this:

- **Amazon-Photo**: 
  > Shchur, O., Mumme, M., Bojchevski, A., & G端nnemann, S. (2018). *Pitfalls of graph neural network evaluation*. In Relational Representation Learning Workshop, NeurIPS.

- **Amazon-Computer**: 
  > Shchur, O., Mumme, M., Bojchevski, A., & G端nnemann, S. (2018). *Pitfalls of graph neural network evaluation*. In Relational Representation Learning Workshop, NeurIPS.

- **Coauthor-CS**: 
  > Shchur, O., Mumme, M., Bojchevski, A., & G端nnemann, S. (2018). *Pitfalls of graph neural network evaluation*. In Relational Representation Learning Workshop, NeurIPS.

- **Coauthor-Physics**:

- **CiteSeer**: 
  > Sen, P., Namata, G., Bilgic, M., Getoor, L., Galligher, J., & Eliassi-Rad, T. (2008). *Collective classification in network data*. AI Magazine, 29(3), 93-93.

- **PubMed**: 
  > Sen, P., Namata, G., Bilgic, M., Getoor, L., Galligher, J., & Eliassi-Rad, T. (2008). *Collective classification in network data*. AI Magazine, 29(3), 93-93.

- **ogbn-arXiv**: 
  > Hu, W., Fey, M., Zitnik, M., Dong, Y., Ren, H., Liu, B., Catasta, M., & Leskovec, J. (2020). *Open graph benchmark: Datasets for machine learning on graphs*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2005.00687.

- **ogbn-MAG**:

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described along with its full citation. This structured approach will help in maintaining clarity and completeness in the dataset extraction process.
