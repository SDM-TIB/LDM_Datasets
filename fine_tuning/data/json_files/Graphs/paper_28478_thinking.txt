To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "ListReader: Extracting List-form Answer for Opinion Questions" by Peng Cui et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that two large-scale datasets were constructed to support the study, which suggests that I should look for their names and details.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors provide a summary of the datasets. Here, they mention two datasets: **WikiHowQA** and **WebQA**. I will extract the relevant details about each dataset, including their purpose, the number of samples, and how they were constructed.

1. **WikiHowQA**: This dataset is collected from www.wikihow.com, where the questions and answers are carefully edited by humans. It consists of 197,936 training samples, 25,000 validation samples, and 25,000 test samples. The dataset is structured around "How to" questions, making it suitable for the task of extracting list-form answers.

2. **WebQA**: This dataset is a Chinese dataset collected from structured web pages. It includes 31,597 training samples, 4,000 validation samples, and 4,000 test samples. The authors describe the collection process, which involves selecting pages based on specific criteria, ensuring that the dataset is relevant for the task.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. However, since these datasets are newly constructed by the authors, they may not have separate citations in the references. Instead, I will note that the datasets are introduced in this paper and provide the citation for the paper itself.

The citation for the paper is:
> Peng Cui, Dongyao Hu, and Le Hu. *ListReader: Extracting List-form Answer for Opinion Questions*. Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with the relevant details and ensure that I include the citation for the paper as the source of these datasets.

In summary, I will create structured entries for **WikiHowQA** and **WebQA**, ensuring to include their descriptions and the citation for the paper as the source of these datasets.
