To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Identifying Generalized Neural Representation Across Hamiltonian Manifolds via Meta-learning" by Yeongwoo Song and Hawoong Jeong, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors trained their model using a dataset of different physical systems, which suggests that there are specific datasets to extract.

Next, I will focus on the **Methods section**, particularly **section 3.1 (Preparing the dataset for meta-learning)**, where the authors describe the construction of a task distribution comprising six distinct types of physical systems: mass-spring, pendulum, Hénon-Heiles, magnetic-mirror, two-body, and three-body. This section provides a clear indication of the datasets used for training.

The authors mention that they generated a dataset with **10,000 trajectories** for each system, which is crucial information. I will note down the specifics of each system as they are described in this section:

1. **Mass-Spring System**: The Hamiltonian is defined, and the initial conditions are described, indicating how the dataset was generated.

2. **Pendulum System**: Similar to the mass-spring system, the Hamiltonian and initial conditions are provided.

3. **Hénon-Heiles System**: The Hamiltonian is more complex, and the authors specify how the dataset was generated.

4. **Magnetic-Mirror System**: The Hamiltonian is provided, along with the method of generating the dataset.

5. **Two-Body System**: The authors describe the gravitational interaction and how the dataset was constructed.

6. **Three-Body System**: The Hamiltonian is provided, and the dataset generation process is described.

In the **Appendix (A Dataset generation)**, the authors detail the procedure for generating the datasets, including the use of the LSODA integrator and the specific initial conditions for each system. This section is essential for understanding how the datasets were created.

Now, I will compile the full citations for each dataset based on the information provided in the references section of the paper. Since the datasets are derived from established physical systems, I will cite the original works where these systems are discussed:

- **Mass-Spring System**: 
  > The mass-spring system is a classical mechanics problem and does not have a specific citation in the paper, but it is widely known in physics literature.

- **Pendulum System**: 
  > The pendulum system is also a classical mechanics problem, commonly referenced in physics textbooks.

- **Hénon-Heiles System**: 
  > Hénon, M., & Heiles, C. (1964). The applicability of the third integral of motion: some numerical experiments. *Astronomical Journal*, 69, 73.

- **Magnetic-Mirror System**: 
  > Efthymiopoulos, C., Harsoula, M., & Contopoulos, G. (2015). Resonant normal form and asymptotic normal form behaviour in magnetic bottle hamiltonians. *Nonlinearity*, 28(4), 851.

- **Two-Body System**: 
  > This is a standard problem in classical mechanics and does not have a specific citation in the paper.

- **Three-Body System**: 
  > This is also a standard problem in classical mechanics and does not have a specific citation in the paper.

After gathering all this information, I will summarize the datasets and their citations in a structured format for easy reference. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations.
