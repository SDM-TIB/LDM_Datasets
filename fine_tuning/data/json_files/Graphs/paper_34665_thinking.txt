To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Robust Quantum Dots Charge Autotuning Using Neural Networks Uncertainty" by Victor Yon et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the method was tested across three distinct offline experimental datasets representing different single quantum dot technologies. This indicates that there are at least three datasets to look for.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** and **problem definition** sections to gather more context about the datasets. In the introduction, the authors mention the challenges of charge tuning in quantum dots and the need for robust methods, which reinforces the importance of the datasets used in their experiments.

I will then focus on the **datasets section** (Section 2.3), where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they detail three datasets:

1. **Silicon Split Gate Quantum Dot (Si-SG-QD)**: This dataset contains 17 stability diagrams measured from devices fabricated with metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) single-layer architecture. The authors provide a reference for this dataset.

2. **Gallium Arsenide Quantum Dot (GaAs-QD)**: This dataset consists of 9 stability diagrams obtained from devices fabricated with GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructure. The authors also provide a reference for this dataset.

3. **Silicon Overlapping Gate Quantum Dot (Si-OG-QD)**: This dataset includes 12 stability diagrams measured from devices fabricated with MOS stacked layers architecture. A reference is provided for this dataset as well.

In the **results** and **discussion** sections, the authors may refer back to these datasets to discuss their findings, but the key details about the datasets are already captured in Section 2.3.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The authors have provided references for the datasets in the datasets section:

- For the **Si-SG-QD dataset**, the citation is:
  > Rochette, S., et al. (2019). *Quantum dots with split enhancement gate tunnel barrier control*. Applied Physics Letters, 114(8), 082101. doi:10.1063/1.5091111.

- For the **GaAs-QD dataset**, the citation is:
  > Gaudreau, L., et al. (2009). *A tunable few electron triple quantum dot*. Applied Physics Letters, 95(19), 190201. doi:10.1063/1.3258663.

- For the **Si-OG-QD dataset**, the citation is:
  > Dumoulin Stuyck, N. I., et al. (2021). *Uniform spin qubit devices with tunable coupling in an all-silicon 300 mm integrated process*. In 2021 Symposium on VLSI Circuits. IEEE. doi:10.23919/VLSICircuits52068.2021.9492427.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their full citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
