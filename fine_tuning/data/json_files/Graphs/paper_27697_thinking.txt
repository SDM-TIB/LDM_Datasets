To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Graph Consistency Based Mean-Teaching for Unsupervised Domain Adaptive Person Re-Identification" by Xiaobin Liu and Shiliang Zhang, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the proposed method is evaluated on three datasets, which indicates that I should look for their names and details.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. They list three datasets:

1. **DukeMTMC-reID**: This dataset contains 36,411 images of 1,812 identities, with 16,522 images of 702 identities used for training. The remaining images are divided into query and gallery sets.

2. **Market-1501**: This dataset consists of 32,668 images of 1,501 identities, with 12,936 images of 751 identities selected for training. Similar to DukeMTMC-reID, the rest of the images are used for query and gallery purposes.

3. **MSMT17**: This dataset includes 126,441 images of 4,101 identities, with 32,621 images of 1,041 identities used for training. The remaining images are also divided into query and gallery sets.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **DukeMTMC-reID**, the citation is:
  > Zhedong Zheng, Liang Zheng, and Yi Yang. *Unlabeled samples generated by GAN improve the person re-identification baseline in vitro*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2017.

- For **Market-1501**, the citation is:
  > Liang Zheng, Liyue Shen, Lu Tian, Shengjin Wang, Jingdong Wang, and Qi Tian. *Scalable person re-identification: A benchmark*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2015.

- For **MSMT17**, the citation is:
  > Longhui Wei, Shiliang Zhang, Wen Gao, and Qi Tian. *Person transfer GAN to bridge domain gap for person re-identification*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2018.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
