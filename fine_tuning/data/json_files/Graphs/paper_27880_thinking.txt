To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Evaluating Modules in Graph Contrastive Learning" by Ganqu Cui et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for evaluation. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the study, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments** section. In this paper, the authors describe their experimental setup in section 6, where they outline the datasets used for node and graph classification tasks. This section is crucial as it typically contains detailed information about the datasets, including their names, characteristics, and how they are utilized in the experiments.

In section 6.3, the authors list several datasets for node classification, including:

1. **Cora**: A citation network dataset with binary word vector features.
2. **Citeseer**: Another citation network with binary word vector features.
3. **Pubmed**: A dataset with tf-idf weighted word vectors.
4. **Wiki-CS**: A dataset of computer science articles from Wikipedia.
5. **Amazon-Computers** and **Amazon-Photo**: Datasets built from Amazon co-purchase graphs.
6. **Coauthor-CS** and **Coauthor-Physics**: Co-authorship graphs based on the Microsoft Academic Graph.

For graph classification, the authors mention:

1. **MUTAG**: A bioinformatics dataset of mutagenic compounds.
2. **PTC-MR**: A dataset containing chemical compounds related to carcinogenicity.
3. **IMDB-B** and **IMDB-M**: Collaboration networks for movies.
4. **Reddit-B**: A dataset from Reddit.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is essential for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets.

For example, the citation for the **Cora dataset** is:
> Sen, P., Namata, G., Bilgic, M., Getoor, L., Galligher, B., & Eliassi-Rad, T. (2008). Collective classification in network data. AI magazine, 29(3), 93-93.

Similarly, I will gather citations for the other datasets mentioned in the paper.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each entry is clear and accurately reflects the content of the paper. This structured approach will help in creating a comprehensive dataset summary that adheres to academic standards.
