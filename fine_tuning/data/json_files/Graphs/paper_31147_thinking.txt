To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "APAM: Adaptive Pre-training and Adaptive Meta Learning in Language Model for Noisy Labels and Long-tailed Learning" by Sunyi Chi et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the framework and mentions that extensive experiments were conducted, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors detail the datasets used for evaluation. In **section 4.1 (Dataset)**, the authors explicitly mention two datasets:

1. **Amazon Annotation Dataset**: This dataset is sampled from Alexa live traffic and consists of spoken language data from dialog interactions between humans and a conversational AI agent. It includes Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) text for utterances, annotated by human annotators. The dataset has over 30 classes and an imbalance factor of 110, with 6% noisy labels.

2. **Amazon Review Dataset**: This dataset is one of the largest product review datasets, containing 142.8 million reviews across 29 product categories. It is widely used for imbalanced classification benchmarks and has an imbalance factor of 51.3.

In the **experiments section**, the authors confirm that they evaluated their proposed framework (APAM) on these two datasets, which solidifies their relevance to the study.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Amazon Annotation Dataset**, the citation is not explicitly provided in the references, but it is described in detail in the paper itself.

- For the **Amazon Review Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Julian McAuley and Jure Leskovec. *Learning to Rank with Nonsmooth Cost Functions*. In Proceedings of the 2013 International Conference on Web Search and Data Mining (WSDM), pages 1â€“10, 2013.

Since the Amazon Annotation Dataset does not have a formal citation in the references, I will note that it is derived from Alexa live traffic and processed to ensure user anonymity.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations where available, and prepare them for structured output.
