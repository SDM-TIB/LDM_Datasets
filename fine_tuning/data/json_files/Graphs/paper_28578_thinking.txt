To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "Pose Recognition in the Wild: Animal pose estimation using agglomerative clustering and contrastive learning" by Samayan Bhattacharya and Sk Shahnawaz, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that the authors tested their model on the **TigDog** and **WLD (WildLife Documentary)** datasets, which indicates that these datasets are crucial for their research.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** where the authors provide a detailed description of the datasets used. In this section, they describe the **TigDog dataset** as consisting of short videos of three animal species: tigers, horses, and dogs, sourced from nature documentaries and the YouTube-Objects dataset. They clarify that the videos are annotated according to the kind of motion the animal is performing, but they ignore these annotations for their study.

The **WLD dataset** is also described in the experiments section. It consists of videos of various species, including tigers, koalas, langurs, and ostriches, sourced from 15 documentary films on YouTube. The authors note that this dataset contains around 4098 short videos of 60 different animal species.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. 

For the **TigDog dataset**, the citation is:
> Del Pero, L., Ricco, S., Sukthankar, R., & Ferrari, V. (2015). Articulated motion discovery using pairs of trajectories. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR).

For the **WLD dataset**, the citation is:
> Chen, K. C. L. D., & Song, H. (2017). Discover and learn new objects from documentaries. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR).

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes the full citation as required. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets used in the research.
