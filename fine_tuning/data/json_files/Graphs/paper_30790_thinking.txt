To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Efficient and Accurate Approximation: Tensor Decomposition Based on Randomized Block Krylov Iteration" by Yichun Qiu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to look for any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's objectives and methods, which may include mentions of datasets used for experiments or simulations.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. This section often contains detailed information about the datasets, including their characteristics, sizes, and any preprocessing steps taken.

In this paper, I will specifically look for any datasets mentioned in the context of numerical experiments or simulations. For instance, the authors may refer to synthetic datasets generated for testing their algorithms, as well as real-world datasets used for validation.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

For example, if the authors mention using the **COIL-100 dataset** and the **CIFAR-10 dataset**, I will look for their respective citations in the references. The citations should include the authors, title, publication venue, and year of publication.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for further processing or documentation, making sure to maintain clarity and completeness in the information provided.
