To extract datasets from the research paper titled "OOD-GNN: Out-of-Distribution Generalized Graph Neural Network" by Haoyang Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on **two synthetic and 12 real-world datasets**. This indicates that there are multiple datasets to look for, and I should pay close attention to any specific names or descriptions provided.

Next, I will move to the **experiments section** (Section 4), where the authors typically provide detailed information about the datasets used. In this section, I will look for any tables or lists that summarize the datasets, including their names, characteristics, and the specific tasks they are used for.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find the following datasets mentioned:

1. **TRIANGLES**: A synthetic dataset consisting of 4,000 random graphs used to predict the number of triangles in each graph. The dataset is split into training, validation, and testing sets.

2. **MNIST-75SP**: Another synthetic dataset generated from the MNIST dataset, consisting of 7,000 graphs created from images using super-pixels. This dataset is also split into training, validation, and testing sets.

3. **COLLAB**: A real-world dataset derived from collaboration networks, used for graph classification tasks.

4. **PROTEINS**: A dataset for protein classification, also used for graph classification tasks.

5. **D&D**: A dataset consisting of protein structures, used for graph classification tasks with specific splits based on graph sizes.

6. **Open Graph Benchmark (OGB)**: This includes several datasets such as TOX21, BACE, BBBP, CLINTOX, SIDER, TOXCAST, HIV, ESOL, and FREESOLV, which are used for various molecular property prediction tasks.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

- For **TRIANGLES**, the dataset is generated as described in the paper, so it does not have a separate citation.
- For **MNIST-75SP**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun, Léon Bottou, Yoshua Bengio, and Patrick Haffner. *Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition*. Proceedings of the IEEE, 86(11):2278–2324, 1998.
  
- For **COLLAB**, **PROTEINS**, and **D&D**, the citation is:
  > Anshumali Shrivastava and Ping Li. *A new space for comparing graphs*. In 2014 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Advances in Social Networks Analysis and Mining (ASONAM 2014), pages 62–71. IEEE, 2014.

- For the **Open Graph Benchmark (OGB)** datasets, the citation is:
  > Weihua Hu, Matthias Fey, Marinka Zitnik, Yuxiao Dong, Hongyu Ren, Bowen Liu, Michele Catasta, and Jure Leskovec. *Open graph benchmark: Datasets for machine learning on graphs*. Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS), 2020.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or processing. This ensures that I have accurately captured all relevant details regarding the datasets used in the research paper.
