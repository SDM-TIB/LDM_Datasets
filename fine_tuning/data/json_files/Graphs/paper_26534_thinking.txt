To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "A Spatially Constrained Deep Convolutional Neural Network for Nerve Fiber Segmentation in Corneal Confocal Microscopic Images Using Inaccurate Annotations" by Ning Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the proposed method has been evaluated based on corneal confocal microscopic (CCM) images for nerve fiber segmentation, which suggests that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 3.1 (Dataset)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention two datasets:

1. **Synthetic CCM Dataset**: This dataset consists of 1000 synthetic images generated for quantitative evaluation, with an additional 500 validation images. The authors describe the process of creating these images, which involves using real CCM images and generating synthetic nerve fibers.

2. **CCM Dataset**: This dataset includes 949 corneal confocal microscopy images captured from 176 subjects (84 healthy and 92 patients with Type 1 diabetes). The authors provide details about the image dimensions and the manual annotation process.

In the **experiments section**, the authors confirm that they used both the synthetic CCM dataset and the real CCM dataset for their evaluations, which reinforces the importance of these datasets in their study.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

- For the **Synthetic CCM Dataset**, since it is generated by the authors, there is no external citation required. However, I will note the methodology used to create it as described in the paper.

- For the **CCM Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Maryam Ferdousi, Shazli Azmi, Mitra Tavakoli, Nathan Efron, Maria Jeziorska, and Rayaz A. Malik. *Small nerve fiber quantification in the diagnosis of diabetic sensorimotor polyneuropathy: comparing corneal confocal microscopy with intraepidermal nerve fiber density*. Diabetes care, vol. 38, no. 6, pp. 1138â€“1144, 2015.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
