To extract datasets from the research paper titled "NePTuNe: Neural Powered Tucker Network for Knowledge Graph Completion" by Shashank Sonkar et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors demonstrate NePTuNe's performance on the **FB15k-237** and **WN18RR** datasets. This indicates that these datasets are likely central to the experiments conducted in the paper.

Next, I will delve into the **introduction** section, where the authors discuss the importance of knowledge graphs and the challenges of link prediction. They mention the datasets again, reinforcing their significance in the context of the research.

Moving on to the **experiments section**, I will look for a dedicated subsection that discusses the datasets used. In this case, the authors explicitly mention both datasets: **FB15k-237** and **WN18RR**. They provide details about the number of entities and relations in each dataset, which is crucial for understanding their scope and application.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are essential for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. 

For the **FB15k-237 dataset**, the citation is:
> Kristina Toutanova, Danqi Chen, Patrick Pantel, Hoifung Poon, Pallavi Choudhury, and Michael Gamon. *Representing text for joint embedding of text and knowledge bases*. In Proceedings of the 2015 conference on empirical methods in natural language processing, pages 1499â€“1509, 2015.

For the **WN18RR dataset**, the citation is:
> Tim Dettmers, Pasquale Minervini, Pontus Stenetorp, and Sebastian Riedel. *Convolutional 2D knowledge graph embeddings*. In Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, volume 32, 2018.

After gathering all this information, I will summarize the datasets, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that I adhere to the required format for clarity and completeness. This structured approach will help in accurately documenting the datasets used in the research.
