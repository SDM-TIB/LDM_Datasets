To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Stock Trading Volume Prediction with Dual-Process Meta-Learning" by Ruibo Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on volume predictions, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used. They state that they adopted **five-minute and ten-minute intra-day volume prediction datasets** extracted from the **Topix500 dataset**. This is a clear indication that these datasets are central to their experiments.

In this section, the authors provide details about the datasets:
- The **five-minute dataset** consists of trading volumes and prices (open, close, high, low) collected over a specific period.
- The **ten-minute dataset** is similarly structured and is also derived from the Topix500 dataset.

I will also check the **data preprocessing section** for any additional details about how these datasets were prepared for analysis. The authors mention that they dropped instances with missing volumes or prices, which is important for understanding the dataset's integrity.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets. Since the Topix500 dataset is mentioned as the source, I will need to find the original citation for it. 

The citation for the Topix500 dataset is:
> Mizuho Securities Co., Ltd. *Topix500 Dataset*. Available at: [URL or DOI if provided].

Since the paper does not provide a specific URL or DOI for the Topix500 dataset, I will note that it is a proprietary dataset from Mizuho Securities.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.
