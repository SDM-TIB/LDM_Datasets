To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Consistency of Muscle Synergies Extracted via Higher-Order Tensor Decomposition Towards Myoelectric Control" by Ahmed Ebied et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the use of a higher-order tensor model for myoelectric control and references the Ninapro dataset, which is a strong indication that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will look closely at the **Methods section**, specifically **section II.A (Data and tensor construction)**, where the authors describe the datasets used in their study. Here, they explicitly mention the **Ninapro first dataset** as the source of the EMG data for their experiments. They detail that this dataset consists of 53 hand, wrist, and finger movements, which is crucial information for understanding the dataset's scope.

In this section, the authors also provide specifics about the data collection process, including the number of subjects and the recording system used, which adds context to the dataset's reliability and applicability.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Ninapro dataset. The relevant citation is:

- For the **Ninapro first dataset**, the citation is:
  > M. Atzori, A. Gijsberts, I. Kuzborskij, S. Elsig, A.-G. Mittaz Hager, O. Deriaz, C. Castellini, H. Muller, and B. Caputo. *Characterization of a Benchmark Database for Myoelectric Movement Classification*. IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering, vol. 23, pp. 73â€“83, Jan. 2015.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the dataset details, ensuring to include the full citation as required. This will allow me to create a comprehensive entry for the dataset used in the study.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that all necessary details are accurately represented.
