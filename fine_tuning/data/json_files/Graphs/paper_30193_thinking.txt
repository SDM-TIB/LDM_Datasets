To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Semi-supervised Training for Knowledge Base Graph Self-attention Networks on Link Prediction" by Shuanglong Yao et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. In the abstract, the authors refer to their experiments on **two benchmark datasets: FB15k-237 and WN18RR**. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for the evaluation of their proposed methods.

Next, I will look into **section 4.1 (Experimental data)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they describe:

1. **FB15k-237**: This dataset is a subset of FB15k, created to address the test leakage problem by filtering out reciprocal or equivalent relationships. It contains 14,541 entities, 237 relations, and a total of 272,115 training facts.

2. **WN18RR**: This dataset is a subset of WN18, which also addresses similar issues as FB15k-237 by filtering out reverse relationships. It consists of 40,943 entities, 11 relations, and 86,835 training facts.

In the **References section**, I will find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **FB15k-237**, the citation is:
  > Toutanova, K., & Chen, D. (2015). *Observations on the State of the Art in Knowledge Base Completion*. In Proceedings of the 29th AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI), pp. 272–278.

- For **WN18RR**, the citation is:
  > Dettmers, T., Minervini, P., Stenetorp, P., & Riedel, S. (2018). *Convolutional 2D Knowledge Graph Embeddings*. In Proceedings of the 32nd AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI), pp. 1811–1818.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
