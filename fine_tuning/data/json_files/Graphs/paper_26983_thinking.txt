To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning and Evaluating Representations for Deep One-Class Classification" by Kihyuk Sohn et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to find any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on visual domain one-class classification benchmarks, which suggests that specific datasets are used.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they mention several benchmarks, including **CIFAR-10**, **CIFAR-100**, **Fashion MNIST**, **Cat-vs-Dog**, **CelebA**, and **MVTec AD**. Each of these datasets is likely to be relevant for their experiments.

I will then look for the **References section** to gather full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with sources for further exploration.

Here are the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. **CIFAR-10**:
   > Alex Krizhevsky. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. Technical report, University of Toronto, 2009.

2. **CIFAR-100**:
   > Alex Krizhevsky. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. Technical report, University of Toronto, 2009.

3. **Fashion MNIST**:
   > Han Xiao, Kashif Rasul, and Roland Vollgraf. *Fashion-MNIST: A novel image dataset for benchmarking machine learning algorithms*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1708.07747, 2017.

4. **Cat-vs-Dog**:
   > Jeremy Elson, John R Douceur, Jon Howell, and Jared Saul. *Asirra: a captcha that exploits interest-aligned manual image categorization*. In ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security, volume 7, pages 366–374, 2007.

5. **CelebA**:
   > Ziwei Liu, Ping Luo, Xiaogang Wang, and Xiaoou Tang. *Deep learning face attributes in the wild*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision, pages 3730–3738, 2015.

6. **MVTec AD**:
   > Paul Bergmann, Michael Fauser, David Sattlegger, and Carsten Steger. *MVTec AD–A comprehensive real-world dataset for unsupervised anomaly detection*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 9592–9600, 2019.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and full citation for each dataset. This will ensure that the extracted information is clear and useful for anyone referencing the paper.
