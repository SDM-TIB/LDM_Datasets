To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Named Entity Recognition Under Domain Shift via Metric Learning for Life Sciences" by Hongyi Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments across three source and three target datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors provide an overview of the datasets used. Here, they mention three source datasets and three target datasets:

1. **Pathway Curation (PC)**: Released by BioNLP Shared Task 2013, this dataset is used for biomedical named entity recognition.
2. **Cancer Genetics (CG)**: Also released by BioNLP Shared Task 2013, this dataset is similar in format to PC.
3. **Infectious Diseases (ID)**: Released by BioNLP Shared Task 2011, this dataset is used as a source for the experiments.

For the target datasets, the authors mention:

1. **CHEMDNER**: A dataset for chemical named entity recognition, released by Krallinger et al. in 2015.
2. **BC5CDR**: A dataset for chemical and disease named entity recognition, released by Kim et al. in 2015.
3. **DrugProt**: A dataset for drug-gene/protein relations, released by Miranda et al. in 2021.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their full citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations.
