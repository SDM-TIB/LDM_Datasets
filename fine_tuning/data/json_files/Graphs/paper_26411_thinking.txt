To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Determination of the relative inclination and the viewing angle of an interacting pair of galaxies using convolutional neural networks" by Prem Prakash et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors used **N-body + Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) simulation data from the GALMER database** for training their models. This suggests that the GALMER database is a key dataset.

Next, I will look for specific details about the datasets in the **methodology section**. In section 2, titled "GALMER," the authors describe the GALMER database in detail, explaining that it simulates interactions between galaxies of different mass ratios and morphological types. They mention that the database allows users to choose various parameters for simulations, which indicates that it is a comprehensive dataset for studying galaxy interactions.

In section 4, titled "Data Collection and Preprocessing," the authors mention that they downloaded images from the GALMER website and applied various image processing techniques to augment the dataset. This section confirms the use of the GALMER dataset for their experiments.

Additionally, the authors state that they tested their model on real data from the **Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 15 (DR15)**. This indicates that SDSS is another dataset used in their research.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the **References section**:

1. **GALMER Database**:

After identifying the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use. This process ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets utilized in the research and their respective citations.
