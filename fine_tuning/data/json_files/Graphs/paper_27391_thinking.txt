To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Constrained Contrastive Distribution Learning for Unsupervised Anomaly Detection and Localisation in Medical Images" by Yu Tian et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on three different colonoscopy and fundus screening datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experiments)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention three datasets:

1. **Hyper-Kvasir Dataset**: This dataset is described as a large multi-class public gastrointestinal dataset containing 110,079 images, with 10,662 labeled images. The authors specify that they used 2,100 images from specific categories for training and testing.

2. **LAG Dataset**: This dataset is a large-scale fundus image dataset for glaucoma detection, containing 4,854 fundus images, with 1,711 positive glaucoma scans and 3,143 negative scans. The authors reorganized this dataset for their experiments.

3. **Liu et al.'s Colonoscopy Dataset**: This dataset consists of colonoscopy images from 18 videos of 15 patients, with 13,250 normal images for training and 967 images for testing, including both normal and abnormal cases.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **Hyper-Kvasir Dataset**:
  > Borgli, H., et al. *Hyperkvasir, a comprehensive multi-class image and video dataset for gastrointestinal endoscopy*. Scientific Data, 7(1), 1–14, 2020.

- For **LAG Dataset**:
  > Li, L., et al. *Attention based glaucoma detection: A large-scale database and CNN model*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 10571–10580, 2019.

- For **Liu et al.'s Colonoscopy Dataset**:

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
