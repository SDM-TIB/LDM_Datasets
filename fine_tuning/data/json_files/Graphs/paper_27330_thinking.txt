To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Few-Shot Graph Learning for Molecular Property Prediction" by Zhichun Guo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments on two public multi-property datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed used in their research. I will note this as a starting point.

Next, I will look into **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they identify two datasets:

1. **Tox21**: This dataset consists of 7,831 instances with 12 different tasks related to toxicity on various biological targets.
2. **Sider**: This dataset contains 1,427 instances with 27 different tasks related to marketed drugs and their adverse drug reactions.

I will also check the **dataset processing** subsection to understand how the datasets were utilized in the experiments. The authors mention that the raw data of molecules are provided as SMILES strings, which are then converted into molecular graphs for analysis.

Now, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution:

- For **Tox21**, the citation is:
  > Han Altae-Tran, Bharath Ramsundar, Aneesh S Pappu, and Vijay Pande. *Low data drug discovery with one-shot learning*. In ACS Central Science, 2017.

- For **Sider**, the citation is:
  > Michael Kuhn, Ivica Letunic, Lars Juhl Jensen, and Peer Bork. *The SIDER database of drugs and side effects*. In Nucleic Acids Research, 2016.

Having gathered all the necessary information, I will summarize the datasets, including their descriptions and citations, ensuring that each dataset is clearly defined and properly attributed. This will allow for a comprehensive understanding of the datasets used in the research.
