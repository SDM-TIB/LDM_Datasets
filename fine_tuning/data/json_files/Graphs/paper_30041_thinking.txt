To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Distributed Contrastive Learning for Medical Image Segmentation" by Yawen Wu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that experiments were conducted on a **cardiac MRI dataset**, which suggests that there are specific datasets used in the research.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section V) where the authors describe their experimental setup. Here, they mention two datasets:

1. **ACDC MICCAI 2017 Challenge Dataset**: This dataset consists of 100 patients with 3D cardiac MRI images, where only volumes for the end-diastolic and end-systolic phases are annotated for three structures: the left ventricle, myocardium, and right ventricle.

2. **HVSMR MICCAI 2016 Challenge Dataset**: This dataset contains 10 3D cardiac MRI images captured in an axial view, with expert annotations of the blood pool and ventricular myocardium.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For the **ACDC MICCAI 2017 Challenge Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Bernard, O., Lalande, A., Zotti, C., Cervenansky, F., Yang, X., Heng, P.-A., Cetin, I., Lekadir, K., Camara, O., & Ballester, M. A. G. (2018). Deep learning techniques for automatic MRI cardiac multi-structures segmentation and diagnosis: Is the problem solved? *IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging*, 37(11), 2514-2525.

- For the **HVSMR MICCAI 2016 Challenge Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Pace, D. F., Dalca, A. V., Geva, T., Powell, A. J., Moghari, M. H. M., & Golland, P. (2015). Interactive whole-heart segmentation in congenital heart disease. In *International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer-Assisted Intervention* (pp. 80-88). Springer.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or processing.
