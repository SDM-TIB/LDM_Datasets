To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DeepHGCN: Toward Deeper Hyperbolic Graph Convolutional Networks" by Jiaxu Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, which indicates that datasets are likely discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets**. In this paper, it appears that the datasets are discussed in **Section V (Experiments)**. I will carefully read through this section to identify the specific datasets used for the experiments.

Upon reviewing Section V, I find that the authors mention four benchmark datasets for node classification and link prediction tasks:

1. **Airport Dataset**: This dataset is described as a transductive dataset where nodes represent airports and edges indicate airline routes derived from OpenFlights. The labels of nodes are determined by the population of the country to which the airport belongs.

2. **PubMed Dataset**: This dataset is used for citation networks, where nodes represent papers connected by citations.

3. **CiteSeer Dataset**: Similar to PubMed, this dataset is also for citation networks.

4. **Cora Dataset**: Another citation network dataset where nodes represent papers connected by citations.

Next, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

- **Airport Dataset**: 
  > OpenFlights. *OpenFlights: Airport, Airline, and Route Data*. Available at: https://openflights.org/data.html.

- **PubMed Dataset**: 
  > Sen, P., Namata, G., Bilgic, M., Getoor, L., Galligher, B., & Eliassi-Rad, T. (2008). *Collective classification in network data*. AI Magazine, 29(3), 93-93.

- **CiteSeer Dataset**: 
  > Giles, C. L., Bollacker, K. D., & Lawrence, S. (1998). *Citeseer: An automatic citation indexing system*. In Proceedings of the third ACM conference on Digital libraries (pp. 89-98).

- **Cora Dataset**: 
  > McCallum, A., & Yang, Y. (2003). *Efficiently inferring data about documents in a citation network*. In Proceedings of the 26th Annual International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval (pp. 1-8).

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that all relevant details are captured and properly attributed.
