To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Representation Selective Self-distillation and wav2vec 2.0 Feature Exploration for Spoof-aware Speaker Verification" by Jin Woo Lee et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their method on the **ASVspoof 2019 LA database**, which suggests that this is a key dataset used in their research.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **Methods section**. In section 3.1 (Experimental Setup), the authors explicitly state that they used the **ASVspoof 2019 LA database** for their experiments. This section provides details about the dataset, including its composition of bona fide and spoofed speeches.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the ASVspoof 2019 LA database. The relevant citation is:

- For **ASVspoof 2019 LA database**:
  > M. Todisco, X. Wang, V. Vestman, M. Sahidullah, H. Delgado, A. Nautsch, J. Yamagishi, N. Evans, T. Kinnunen, and K. A. Lee. *ASVspoof 2019: Future horizons in spoofed and fake audio detection*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1904.05441, 2019.

Additionally, the authors mention the **VCTK corpus** in the context of the ASVspoof 2019 LA database. I will also look for its citation in the references. The citation for the VCTK corpus is:

- For **VCTK corpus**:
  > J. Yamagishi, C. Veaux, K. MacDonald et al. *CSTR VCTK corpus: English multi-speaker corpus for CSTR voice cloning toolkit (version 0.92)*, 2019.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity.

The datasets extracted from the paper are:
1. **ASVspoof 2019 LA database**
   - Citation: M. Todisco, X. Wang, V. Vestman, M. Sahidullah, H. Delgado, A. Nautsch, J. Yamagishi, N. Evans, T. Kinnunen, and K. A. Lee. *ASVspoof 2019: Future horizons in spoofed and fake audio detection*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1904.05441, 2019.

2. **VCTK corpus**
   - Citation: J. Yamagishi, C. Veaux, K. MacDonald et al. *CSTR VCTK corpus: English multi-speaker corpus for CSTR voice cloning toolkit (version 0.92)*, 2019.

With this information, I am ready to present the dataset entries in the required format for further processing or review.
