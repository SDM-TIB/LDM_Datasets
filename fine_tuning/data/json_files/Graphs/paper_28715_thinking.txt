To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Dual Cluster Contrastive Learning for Object Re-Identification" by Hantao Yao and Changsheng Xu, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant details, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that extensive experiments were conducted on three benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved. 

Next, I will look for a dedicated **Datasets** section, which is often included in research papers. In this case, I find a table (Table 1) that summarizes the datasets used in the evaluation. The datasets listed are:

1. **Market-1501**: This dataset is used for person re-identification and contains 1,501 identities, 32,668 images, and 6 camera views.
2. **MSMT17**: Another dataset for person re-identification, it includes 4,101 identities, 126,441 images, and 15 camera views.
3. **VeRi-776**: This dataset is focused on vehicle re-identification, comprising 776 identities, 49,357 images, and 20 camera views.

Now, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are typically formatted in a specific way, and I will ensure to capture the necessary details such as authors, title, conference/journal, and year.

Upon reviewing the references, I find the following citations:

- For **Market-1501**:
  > Liang Zheng, Liyue Shen, Lu Tian, Shengjin Wang, Jingdong Wang, and Qi Tian. *Scalable person re-identification: A benchmark*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 1116–1124, 2015.

- For **MSMT17**:
  > Weihao Yuan, Liang Zheng, and Yi Yang. *MSMT17: A Large-scale Benchmark for Multi-Source Person Re-identification*. In Proceedings of the European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), pages 1–17, 2018.

- For **VeRi-776**:
  > Feng Zheng, Cheng Deng, Xing Sun, Xinyang Jiang, Xiaowei Guo, Zongqiao Yu, Feiyue Huang, and Rongrong Ji. *Person transfer GAN to bridge domain gap for person re-identification*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 79–88, 2018.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their full citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use. This process ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their respective citations from the research paper.
