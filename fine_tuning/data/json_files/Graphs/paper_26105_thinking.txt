To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Low-Rank Approximation for CNNs" by Dongsoo Lee et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly referenced. The abstract discusses low-rank approximation techniques and their application to CNNs, but it does not mention specific datasets. 

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors discuss model compression techniques and their applications. Here, they mention that low-rank approximation has been successfully applied to speech recognition and language models, but again, no specific datasets are named.

Moving on to the **experimental results section**, I will look for any references to datasets used in their experiments. The authors mention using the **CIFAR-10 dataset** for training their models, specifically in the context of comparing different low-rank approximation techniques. They also mention using the **ImageNet dataset** for experiments with the ResNet-34 model.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **CIFAR-10 dataset**, the citation is:
   > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical Report, 2009. 

2. For the **ImageNet dataset**, the citation is:
   > Olga Russakovsky, Jia Deng, Hao Sheng Su, et al. *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision (IJCV), 115(3):211â€“252, 2015. doi: 10.1007/s11263-015-0816-y.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations as required. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
