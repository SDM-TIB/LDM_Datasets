To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Shape-Aware Monocular 3D Object Detection" by Wei Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the development of a monocular 3D object detection model, which suggests that datasets may be involved in the evaluation of this model.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section** to identify any specific datasets mentioned. The authors discuss the challenges of monocular 3D object detection and reference existing methods, which may lead to the identification of datasets used in their experiments.

I will then examine the **experiments section** closely, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they mention that their method is evaluated on the **KITTI dataset**, which is a well-known benchmark for 3D object detection.

To ensure I have all necessary details, I will also check the **references section** for full citations of the datasets mentioned. The citation for the KITTI dataset is as follows:

- **KITTI Dataset**: 
  > Andreas Geiger, Philip Lenz, and Raquel Urtasun. *Are we ready for autonomous driving? The KITTI vision benchmark suite*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2012.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and that the full citation is included. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
