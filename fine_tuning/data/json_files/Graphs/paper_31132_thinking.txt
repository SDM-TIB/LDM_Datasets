To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Cluster-aware Contrastive Learning for Unsupervised Out-of-distribution Detection" by Menglong Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on various image benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors describe their experimental setup. They mention using the **CIFAR-10** dataset as the in-distribution (ID) training data. This is a key dataset that I need to document.

In the same section, the authors list several out-of-distribution (OOD) datasets used for testing, which include:

1. **SVHN** (Street View House Numbers)
2. **LSUN** (Large-scale Scene Understanding)
3. **ImageNet**
4. **CIFAR-100**
5. **Linearly-interpolated samples of CIFAR-10 (Interp.)**

I will now check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. 

- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical Report, 2009.

- For **SVHN**, the citation is:
  > Yuval Netzer, Tao Wang, Adam Coates, Alessandro Bissacco, Bo Wu, and Andrew Y. Ng. *Reading Digits in Natural Images with Unsupervised Feature Learning*. In Proceedings of the Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS), 2011.

- For **LSUN**, the citation is:
  > Fisher Yu, Vladlen Koltun. *Multi-Scale Context Aggregation by Dilated Convolutions*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR), 2016.

- For **ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Olga Russakovsky, Jia Deng, Hao Sheng, et al. *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 115(3):211â€“252, 2015.

- For **CIFAR-100**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical Report, 2009.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately documented the datasets used in the research and their respective citations.
