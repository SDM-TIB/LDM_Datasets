To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Composite Concept Extraction through Backdooring" by Banibrata Ghosh et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that extensive experiments were conducted using three well-known image datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention three datasets:

1. **CIFAR-10**: This is a popular image classification dataset consisting of 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images across 10 classes.

2. **MIT-States**: This dataset contains 63,440 images of 245 objects across 115 different states, such as different appearances of the same object (e.g., an elephant painted or unpainted).

3. **CelebA**: A dataset of facial images of celebrities, containing 200,000 images, each annotated with 40 binary attributes (e.g., blond hair, eyeglasses).

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical Report, 2009.

- For **MIT-States**, the citation is:
  > A. Farhadi, M. Hejrati, and M. A. S. Kamal. *MIT States: A Dataset for Understanding Object States*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2010.

- For **CelebA**, the citation is:
  > Ziwei Liu, Ping Luo, Xiaogang Wang, and Xiaoou Tang. *Deep Learning Face Attributes in the Wild*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 3730â€“3738, 2015.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations.
