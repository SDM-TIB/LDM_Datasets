To extract datasets from the research paper titled "PatternPortrait: Draw Me Like One of Your Scribbles" by Sabine Wieluch and Friedhelm Schwenker, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned or implied. The abstract discusses the process of generating abstract portrait drawings but does not explicitly mention any datasets. However, the introduction provides context about the artistic process and the use of generative patterns, which may hint at the types of data used.

Next, I will examine **section 2 (Generating Sketch Portraits: System Overview and Constraints)**, where the authors mention the need for a dataset containing sketch drawings. They state that they cannot provide a dataset with thousands of sketches, indicating that they may have used a limited number of template sketches for their experiments. This suggests that the dataset is likely small and specific to their artistic style.

In **section 4 (Generating Abstract Shading via Graph Neural Nets)**, the authors describe the use of a single reference drawing for shading patterns. This implies that they may have utilized a specific dataset of sketches or drawings, but they do not provide a formal dataset name or citation.

Since the paper does not explicitly list any datasets in a dedicated section, I will check the **References section** for any citations that may refer to datasets or related works that could serve as datasets. However, the references primarily cite other research papers and methodologies rather than specific datasets.

After reviewing the entire paper, it appears that the authors did not use publicly available datasets but rather relied on their own sketches and templates for the project. Therefore, I will note that the dataset is not formally cited and is based on the authors' original work.

In conclusion, I will summarize the findings regarding the dataset:
- The authors utilized their own sketches as a dataset for the project, but no formal dataset name or citation is provided in the paper.

Now, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and future reference.
