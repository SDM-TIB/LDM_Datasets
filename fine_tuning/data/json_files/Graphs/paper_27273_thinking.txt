To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Domain Invariant Single Image Dehazing" by Pranjay Shyam et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the challenges of haze in images and the need for effective dehazing algorithms, but it does not specify any datasets. The introduction elaborates on the importance of accurate image recovery in various applications but still lacks specific dataset names.

Next, I will examine the **experimental evaluations** section, which is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets used for validation. In this section, the authors mention several datasets explicitly:

1. **NTIRE-18**: A real dataset used for evaluating dehazing algorithms, with a resolution of 4177 × 3134 pixels.
2. **NTIRE-19**: Another real dataset with a resolution of 1600 × 1200 pixels.
3. **NTIRE-20**: A real dataset also with a resolution of 1600 × 1200 pixels.
4. **SOTS (Synthetic Outdoor Scene)**: This dataset is divided into two parts:
   - **SOTS-IN**: A synthetic dataset with a resolution of 620 × 460 pixels.
   - **SOTS-OUT**: Another synthetic dataset with a resolution of 550 × 478 pixels.
5. **Haze-RD**: A synthetic dataset with a resolution of 3492 × 2558 pixels.

The authors also provide a summary table (Table 1) that outlines the properties of these datasets, confirming their use in experiments.

Next, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured all relevant details from the paper regarding the datasets used in the research.
