To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Reinforcement Learning-based Non-Autoregressive Solver for Traveling Salesman Problems" by Yubin Xiao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for experiments or evaluations.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used in their evaluations. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics. If the authors refer to specific datasets, I will note down their names and any relevant details provided.

In this paper, I will pay particular attention to any tables or figures that summarize the datasets or their characteristics, as these often contain concise information about the datasets used in the experiments.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial, as proper citation is necessary for academic integrity and for others to locate the datasets.

For example, if the authors mention using a dataset like the **TSPLIB**, I will look for the corresponding citation in the references. The citation might look something like this:
> Z. Fu, K. Qiu, and H. Zha, “Generalize a small pre-trained model to arbitrarily large TSP instances,” in Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, 2021, pp. 7474–7482.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset names along with their full citations into a structured format for clarity and ease of use.

Finally, I will ensure that I have accurately captured all datasets mentioned in the paper, including any that may have been referenced indirectly or in passing, to provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research.
