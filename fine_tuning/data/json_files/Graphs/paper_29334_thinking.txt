To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Probabilistic Representations for Video Contrastive Learning" by Jungin Park et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections. In the abstract, the authors mention that their method achieves state-of-the-art performance on popular benchmarks, specifically naming **UCF101** and **HMDB51**. This indicates that these datasets are likely used in their experiments.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section**, particularly **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors typically provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used. Here, they explicitly mention:

1. **Kinetics-400**: This dataset contains approximately 240,000 training videos across 400 human action categories. It is a well-known benchmark for action recognition tasks.

2. **UCF101**: This dataset consists of around 13,000 videos categorized into 101 action classes. It is commonly used for evaluating action recognition algorithms.

3. **HMDB51**: This dataset includes about 7,000 videos across 51 action categories. It is another standard benchmark for action recognition.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and further exploration of the datasets.

The full citations I will extract are:

- For **Kinetics-400**:
  > Will Kay, Joao Carreira, Karen Simonyan, Brian Zhang, Chloe Hillier, Sudheendra Vijayanarasimhan, Fabio Viola, Tim Green, Trevor Back, Paul Natsev, Mustafa Suleyman, and Andrew Zisserman. *The kinetics human action video dataset*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1705.06950, 2017.

- For **UCF101**:
  > Khurram Soomro, Amir Roshan Zamir, and Mubarak Shah. *UCF101: A dataset of 101 human actions classes from videos in the wild*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1212.0402, 2012.

- For **HMDB51**:
  > Hildegard Kuehne, Hueihan Jhuang, Est´ıbaliz Garrote, Tomaso Poggio, and Thomas Serre. *HMDB: A large video database for human motion recognition*. In ICCV, 2011.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference and further processing. This will ensure that I have accurately captured all necessary details regarding the datasets used in the research.
