To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SurvivalGAN: Generating Time-to-Event Data for Survival Analysis" by Alexander Norcliffe et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract and introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions and may mention specific datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section**, particularly section 6, where the authors discuss the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they explicitly list the datasets and provide details about each one. I will look for the following key information for each dataset:
- Name of the dataset
- Description of the dataset (e.g., what it contains, its purpose)
- Any relevant statistics (e.g., number of instances, features)

In this paper, the authors mention five datasets:
1. **ACTG 320 clinical trial dataset (AIDS)**: This dataset is used for analyzing survival data related to HIV patients.
2. **Cambridge Urology Translational Research and Clinical Trials dataset (CUTRACT)**: This dataset focuses on prostate cancer mortality in the UK.
3. **Private heart failure dataset (PHEART)**: This dataset consists of patients from various medical studies who have experienced heart failure.
4. **SEER dataset**: This dataset is related to prostate cancer mortality in the US.
5. **Molecular Taxonomy of Breast Cancer International Consortium dataset (METABRIC)**: This dataset contains targeted sequencing data of breast cancer samples.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:
- **ACTG 320 clinical trial dataset (AIDS)**: Hammer, S. M., et al. (1997). "A Controlled Trial of Two Nucleoside Analogues Plus Indinavir in Persons with Human Immunodeficiency Virus Infection and CD4 Cell Counts of 200 per Cubic Millimeter or Less." *New England Journal of Medicine*, 337(11): 725-733.
- **CUTRACT dataset**: Cambridge Prostate Cancer. (2019). "Prostate Cancer." Retrieved from https://prostatecanceruk.org/.
- **PHEART dataset**: (Details not provided in the paper; may require contacting the authors or the institution for citation).
- **SEER dataset**: Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program. (2019). Retrieved from https://www.seer.cancer.gov/.
- **METABRIC dataset**: Pereira, B., et al. (2016). "The somatic mutation profiles of 2,433 breast cancers refine their genomic and transcriptomic landscapes." *Nature Communications*, 7: 11479.

Finally, I will compile the extracted information into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations. This will ensure that the datasets are clearly documented and easily accessible for future reference.
