To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Uncovering the Structural Fairness in Graph Contrastive Learning" by Ruijia Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention that they conduct experiments on various benchmarks and evaluation protocols. This suggests that there are specific datasets involved, but I need to locate their names and details.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, they mention using four real-world datasets for their experiments: **Cora**, **Citeseer**, **Photo**, and **Computer**. Each of these datasets is associated with specific characteristics, such as the number of nodes, edges, features, and classes.

I will then check the **appendices** or **references section** for full citations of these datasets. The paper provides the following citations for the datasets:

1. **Cora Dataset**:
   > Thomas N. Kipf and Max Welling. *Semi-supervised classification with graph convolutional networks*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR), 2017.

2. **Citeseer Dataset**:
   > Thomas N. Kipf and Max Welling. *Semi-supervised classification with graph convolutional networks*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR), 2017.

3. **Photo Dataset**:
   > Oleksandr Shchur, Maximilian Mumme, Aleksandar Bojchevski, and Stephan Günnemann. *Pitfalls of graph neural network evaluation*. In NeurIPS Workshop on Relational Representation Learning, 2018.

4. **Computer Dataset**:
   > Oleksandr Shchur, Maximilian Mumme, Aleksandar Bojchevski, and Stephan Günnemann. *Pitfalls of graph neural network evaluation*. In NeurIPS Workshop on Relational Representation Learning, 2018.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will summarize the key details for each dataset, including their characteristics and the full citations.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly presents each dataset along with its citation, ensuring that all relevant details are included for future reference or analysis.
