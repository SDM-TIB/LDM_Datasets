To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Training-free CryoET Tomogram Segmentation" by Yizhou Zhao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of a framework called CryoSAM for segmenting CryoET tomograms, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the introduction and experiments sections.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges in CryoET and the need for annotated datasets for particle picking. However, they do not specify any datasets at this point. 

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**. Here, the authors mention that they utilize the **EMPIAR-10499 dataset** for their quantitative performance assessment of CryoSAM. This dataset is described as comprising 65 tilt-series of native M. pneumoniae cells with annotated ribosomes. This is a clear indication that I have found a dataset relevant to their research.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the EMPIAR-10499 dataset. The citation provided in the references is:
> Iudin, A., Korir, P.K., Salavert-Torres, J., Kleywegt, G.J., Patwardhan, A. (2016). *EMPIAR: A public archive for raw electron microscopy image data*. Nature Methods, 13(5), 387â€“388.

Since this is the only dataset mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information I have gathered.

The dataset entry will include the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. 

After completing this process, I will ensure that the dataset entry is structured correctly and ready for any further processing or review.
