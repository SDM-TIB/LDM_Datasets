To extract datasets from the research paper titled "EuroPED-NN: Uncertainty aware surrogate model" by A. Panera Alvarez et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study uses data from the **JET-ILW pedestal database**, which suggests that this is a key dataset for the research.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for any additional context or details about datasets. The introduction discusses the need for surrogate models in plasma physics but does not introduce new datasets.

I will then focus on **section 2 (Development of EuroPED-NN)**, particularly **subsection 2.4 (Zero-Dimensional Pedestal Database)**, where the authors describe the dataset used for training the model. Here, they mention that the dataset is derived from a specialized collection of **JET-ILW plasma discharges** and their corresponding EuroPED predictions. They specify that the dataset includes 1317 entries, with 257 removed due to missing variables.

In this subsection, the authors detail the specific variables included in the dataset, which are:
- Electron density at ψpol = ψ0, denoted as ne(ψ0)
- Electron temperature at ψpol = ψ0, denoted as Te(ψ0)
- Pedestal width, denoted as ∆

This confirms that the **Zero-Dimensional Pedestal Database** is a critical dataset for their analysis.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the JET-ILW pedestal database. The authors reference a paper by Frassinetti et al. (2020) that discusses the JET-ILW pedestal database. The citation is as follows:
> L. Frassinetti, S. Saarelma, G. Verdoolaege, M. Groth, J. Hillesheim, P. Bilkova, P. Bohm, M. Dunne, R. Fridström, E. Giovannozzi, F. Imbeaux, B. Labit, E. de la Luna, C. Maggi, M. Owsiak, and R. Scannell. *Pedestal structure, stability and scalings in JET-ILW: the EUROfusion JET-ILW pedestal database*. Nuclear Fusion 61, 016001 (2020).

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the findings:

1. **Zero-Dimensional Pedestal Database**: This dataset is derived from JET-ILW plasma discharges and includes variables such as electron density, electron temperature, and pedestal width. It consists of 1317 entries, with some entries removed due to missing data.

The full citation for this dataset is:
> L. Frassinetti, S. Saarelma, G. Verdoolaege, M. Groth, J. Hillesheim, P. Bilkova, P. Bohm, M. Dunne, R. Fridström, E. Giovannozzi, F. Imbeaux, B. Labit, E. de la Luna, C. Maggi, M. Owsiak, and R. Scannell. *Pedestal structure, stability and scalings in JET-ILW: the EUROfusion JET-ILW pedestal database*. Nuclear Fusion 61, 016001 (2020).

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
