To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The Met Dataset: Instance-level Recognition for Artworks" by Nikolaos-Antonios Ypsilantis et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions the introduction of a dataset for instance-level recognition in the domain of artworks, which indicates that a dataset is indeed present. The introduction further elaborates on the challenges and the significance of the dataset, hinting at its scale and the types of images included.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets**. In this paper, there is a section titled **"2 The Met dataset"** that provides detailed information about the dataset. Here, the authors describe the dataset's composition, including the types of images (exhibit images and query images) and their respective counts. 

The dataset is characterized as follows:
1. **Exhibit Images**: Approximately 397,121 images corresponding to about 224,408 unique exhibits (classes).
2. **Query Images**: About 20,000 query images, which are further divided into:
   - **Met Queries**: Images taken by museum visitors.
   - **Other Artwork Queries**: Images of artworks from collections that do not belong to The Met.
   - **Non-Artwork Queries**: Images that do not depict artworks.

I will also check the **table summarizing dataset statistics** to confirm the numbers and understand the structure of the dataset, which includes training, validation, and test splits.

Next, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The authors compare their dataset with existing datasets in the artwork domain and provide citations for those datasets. However, since the primary focus is on "The Met" dataset, I will ensure to cite it properly.

The citation for "The Met Dataset" is as follows:
> Ypsilantis, N.-A., Garcia, N., Han, G., Ibrahimi, S., van Noord, N., & Tolias, G. (2021). The Met Dataset: Instance-level Recognition for Artworks. In Proceedings of the 35th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2021) Track on Datasets and Benchmarks. Retrieved from http://cmp.felk.cvut.cz/met/.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset details, ensuring that I include the full citation for "The Met Dataset" as well as any other datasets referenced in the paper. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets extracted from the research paper.
