To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Vehicle Lane Change Prediction based on Knowledge Graph Embeddings and Bayesian Inference" by M. Manzour et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that the proposed solution leverages the **HighD dataset**, which indicates that this dataset is crucial for the research.

Next, I will look for specific sections that detail the datasets used. In the **Preliminary section (III)**, the authors provide a brief introduction to the **HighD dataset**. They describe it as a German dataset that records naturalistic top-view scenes on German highway roads using a camera integrated into a quadcopter. This section provides essential details about the dataset, including its size and the type of information it contains.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the **HighD dataset**. The citation is as follows:
> R. Krajewski, J. Bock, L. Kloeker, and L. Eckstein. *The HighD Dataset: A Drone Dataset of Naturalistic Vehicle Trajectories on German Highways for Validation of Highly Automated Driving Systems*. In Proceedings of the 21st International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC), pages 2118â€“2125, 2018.

Since the paper primarily focuses on the **HighD dataset**, I will ensure to document this dataset thoroughly. 

Now, I will compile the extracted dataset information, including the full citation, into a structured format for further processing or review.
