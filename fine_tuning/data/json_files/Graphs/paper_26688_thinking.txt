To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Graph Neural Network Based Coarse-Grained Mapping Prediction" by Zhiheng Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors present a novel dataset called **Human-annotated Mappings (HAM)**, which consists of 1,206 molecules with expert-annotated mapping operators. This indicates that HAM is a key dataset for the study.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for further details about the dataset. The introduction mentions that the HAM dataset is used to train and evaluate their proposed model, confirming its significance in the research.

I will then look at **section 4.1 (Dataset)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the HAM dataset. They explain that it contains CG mappings of 1,206 organic molecules, each with expert annotations. The molecules were sourced from the PubChem database, and the annotations were reviewed for quality. This section provides essential details about the dataset's composition and purpose.

After gathering the necessary information, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the HAM dataset. The authors mention that the dataset can be downloaded from a GitHub repository, which is a crucial detail for citation purposes. The citation for the dataset will be formatted as follows:

- **Human-annotated Mappings (HAM)**:
  > Li, Zhiheng, Wellawatte, Geemi P., Chakraborty, Maghesree, Gandhi, Heta A., Xu, Chenliang, and White, Andrew D. *Graph Neural Network Based Coarse-Grained Mapping Prediction*. Preprint available at: https://github.com/rochesterxugroup/HAM_dataset/releases.

Now, I will compile the dataset entry for the HAM dataset, ensuring that I include all relevant details and the full citation. This will allow for proper referencing and facilitate further research in the field.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry in a structured format for easy access and review.
